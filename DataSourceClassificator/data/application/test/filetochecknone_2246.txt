RESPONDING TO STUDENT DIVERSITY: TWO CASES IN CYPRUS
This study set out to examine how the Cypriot educational context is structuredto promote inclusive education to cater for the needs of the increasingly diversestudent population in Greek-Cypriot public schools. Emphasis was given toidentifying barriers to the inclusive education of non-Greek-Cypriot students.Ways of addressing these barriers, and therefore ways to promote an inclusiveand essentially a multicultural education in schools in Cyprus, were explored.The research design involved the evaluation of two cases: a primary school inLimassol and a secondary school in Nicosia. Both schools catered for anethnically diverse student population. The use of a multi-method techniqueallowed primarily for the exploration of the “voices” of pupils in these schools, onthe topic of inclusive educational provision present in their schools. Teachers’interviews extended the image of the inclusive & multicultural education as itexisted in the schools studied.During the study the most significant barrier to non-Greek-Cypriot students’inclusion appeared to be the lack of Greek language skills, which affects theirsocialization, participation and achievement at school. Other barriers lie with thenegative attitudes of classmates and teaching staff in schools. It is recommendedthat a unified governmental attempt to provide assistance with learning the Greeklanguage in both Primary and Secondary education, and in eliminating negativeattitudes towards non-Greek-Cypriot students could greatly improve theirlearning experiences and inclusion in schools.

Evidence for the presence of bacteria in the blood of psoriasis patients.
Evidence exists that microorganisms, particularly in the throat and skin, play a role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether evidence for the presence of bacteria, including Streptococcus pyogenes, can be demonstrated in the peripheral blood of patients with guttate and/or chronic plaque psoriasis. Peripheral blood samples from 20 patients with psoriasis, seven guttate, six chronic plaque and seven chronic plaque with associated guttate flare and from 16 control subjects were studied for the presence of bacteria by PCR using universal 16S ribosomal DNA primers and specific primers for S. pyogenes. Sequence analysis of amplified 16S rRNA sequences was used to determine taxonomic identity. Ribosomal bacterial DNA was detected in the blood of all 20 patients with psoriasis, but in none of the controls. Streptococci were detected in six of seven patients with guttate psoriasis, but none had staphylococci. In contrast, staphylococci were identified in 9 of 13 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, whilst only 2 demonstrated streptococci. In three psoriasis patients, species other than streptococci and staphylococci were identified. These findings suggest that psoriasis is associated with bacteraemia, with distinct taxonomic groups present in guttate and chronic plaque psoriatic subtypes. The causes of the bacteraemia and its implications in psoriasis have yet to be determined.

Structure of hydrogen-dosed graphene deduced from low electron energy loss characteristics and density functional calculations
We employed nanometer-scale spatially resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy to monitor the degree and localization of electronic passivation of graphene surfaces by using the pi-plasmon as an indicator of sp(2)-bonding. Upon hydrogenation, the pi-plasmon does not vanish, and a new feature at 7 eV occurs in the spectra. This behavior conforms to the theoretical electron energy loss spectra derived from density functional calculations for partial hydrogenation, with benzene rings assuming a corrugated structure. The spatial distribution of the spectral features and atomic resolution Z-contrast images indicate absence of any long-range ordering in the hydrogenated areas.

Global Civil Unrest: Contagion, Self-Organization, and Prediction
Civil unrest is a powerful form of collective human dynamics, which has led to major transitions of societies in modern history. The study of collective human dynamics, including collective aggression, has been the focus of much discussion in the context of modeling and identification of universal patterns of behavior. In contrast, the possibility that civil unrest activities, across countries and over long time periods, are governed by universal mechanisms has not been explored. Here, records of civil unrest of 170 countries during the period 1919–2008 are analyzed. It is demonstrated that the distributions of the number of unrest events per year are robustly reproduced by a nonlinear, spatially extended dynamical model, which reflects the spread of civil disorder between geographic regions connected through social and communication networks. The results also expose the similarity between global social instability and the dynamics of natural hazards and epidemics.

Abundant IFN-gamma production by local T cells in respiratory syncytial virus-induced eosinophilic lung disease.
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a frequent cause of severe lung disease in young children. Primed T cells are required for virus clearance, but are causally implicated in the enhanced pathology seen following RSV infection of some infants and experimental animals vaccinated against the virus. In BALB/c mice, vaccination with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the viral attachment protein (G) leads to pulmonary eosinophilia during subsequent infection, which indirect evidence suggests may be due to CD4+ Th2 cells. The production of IFN-gamma, IL-2, -4, -5 and -10 cytokine mRNA by RT-PCR and intracellular cytokines by flow cytometry following RSV challenge of vaccinated mice were therefore compared. Lung eosinophilia was associated with enhanced local recruitment of CD4+ cells in G sensitized mice, while CD8+ cells dominated in mice vaccinated with the viral fusion protein (F) or second matrix protein (M2). Lung eosinophilia was also associated with a localized reduction in IFN-gamma and increased IL-4 and IL-5 mRNA transcription as well as elevated RSV specific IgG1 antibody production. Th2 cytokine protein production by T cells showed no apparent change. Although IFN-gamma production diminished in eosinophilic mice, it remained the major cytokine found in lung T cells. It was concluded that lung eosinophilia can develop despite abundant IFN-gamma production by local T cells, but is associated with a shift in the balance between Th2 and Th1 cytokine production.

AN ONTOLOGICAL APPROACH FOR MONITORING AND SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS IN UNREGULATED MARKETS
Ontologies are a key factor of Information management as they provide a common representation to any domain. Historically, finance domain has suffered from a lack of efficiency in managing vast amounts of financial data, a lack of communication and knowledge sharing between analysts. Particularly, with the growth of fraud in financial markets, cases are challenging, complex, and involve a huge volume of information. Gathering facts and evidence is often complex.  Thus, the impetus for building a financial fraud ontology arises from the continuous improvement and development of financial market surveillance systems with high analytical capabilities to capture frauds which is essential to guarantee and preserve an efficient market.This thesis proposes an ontology-based approach for financial market surveillance systems. The proposed ontology acts as a semantic representation of mining concepts from unstructured resources and other internet sources (corpus). The ontology contains a comprehensive concept system that can act as a semantically rich knowledge base for a market monitoring system. This could help fraud analysts to understand financial fraud practices, assist open investigation by managing relevant facts gathered for case investigations, providing early detection techniques of fraudulent activities, developing prevention practices, and sharing manipulation patterns from prosecuted cases with investigators and relevant users.  The usefulness of the ontology will be evaluated through three case studies, which not only help to explain how manipulation in markets works, but will also demonstrate how the ontology can be used as a framework for the extraction process and capturing information related to financial fraud, to improve the performance of surveillance systems in fraud monitoring. Given that most manipulation cases occur in the unregulated markets, this thesis uses a sample of fraud cases from the unregulated markets. On the empirical side, the thesis presents examples of novel applications of text-mining tools and data-processing components, developing off-line surveillance systems that are fully working prototypes which could train the ontology in the most recent manipulation techniques.

DIET, DISEASE AND DEATH AT DAKHLEH: A HISTOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF TEN MUMMIES FROM THE KELLIS 1 CEMETERY IN THE DAKHLEH OASIS, EGYPT.
Histology is a technique that has any number of diagnostic uses in modern hospital laboratories. However, as a scientific method employed in the study of ancient and mummified remains, it appears to have lost its popularity.This project explores the advantages and limitations of histology as a technique for such studies.  In order to do so, soft tissue and bone samples from ten early Roman Period mummies (30 BCE – 250 CE) from the Kellis 1 cemetery in the Dakhleh Oasis have been histologically examined.While this project focuses on the scientific technique of histology, and its application for the study of ancient remains, it also aims to be cross-disciplinary by incorporating scientific results from the ten mummies with the historical data and archaeological remains uncovered during excavations of the Kellis site.  By bringing the results of science and Egyptology/archaeology together, it hoped that a better understanding of ancient Egyptian society could be achieved.

Epidermal cytokines and skin sensitization hazard.
The induction phase of skin sensitization is associated with the passage of antigen-bearing Langerhans cells (LC) from the epidermis to the draining lymph nodes. Recent investigations have revealed that the induction of LC migration following topical sensitization is dependent on tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), an epidermal cytokine. While in transit to the lymph nodes LC are subject to both phenotypic and functional maturation which, by analogy with in vitro studies, is also effected by epidermal cytokines (granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, GM-CSF and interleukin-1, IL-1). It is now apparent that Langerhans cell function, the induction of cutaneous immune responses and effective sensitization are dependent on the availability of such cytokines and that contact allergens are able to provoke their production by keratinocytes and by Langerhans cells themselves. The development of screening strategies for the evaluation of skin sensitization potential as a function of epidermal cytokine production is discussed.

Opsonic effect of C-reactive protein on phagocytosis and intracellular killing of virulent and attenuated strains of Candida albicans by human neutrophils.
In the presence of autologous complement, maximal phagocytosis of Candida albicans blastospores of both a virulent and attenuated strain by human neutrophils in a monolayer assay was achieved after 30 min. The proportion of phagocytes containing intracellular blastospores was 33-36% with an average of 1.5 blastospores per phagocyte. In contrast to the attenuated strain of C. albicans, the virulent strain resisted opsonization by C-reactive protein (CRP) and of those blastospores ingested, only 8% were killed. These findings support the concept that CRP may play a protective role in candidosis independent of complement. The fate of strains of different virulence may be a result of differences in CRP receptors or killing mechanisms.

Acute diarrhoea induces rectal sensitivity in women but not men.
Some patients with diarrhoea predominant irritable bowel syndrome have increased rectal sensitivity. It is uncertain, however, whether the diarrhoea is a consequence of the rectal sensitivity or if it is sensitising the rectum in some way. The aim of this study was to assess whether inducing diarrhoea in normal healthy volunteers can sensitise the rectum and therefore be a potential or partial cause of the sensitive rectum seen in some patients with diarrhoea predominant irritable bowel syndrome. The anorectal responses to balloon distension were measured in 20 healthy volunteers (aged 20-43 years, 10 female) eight hours after laxative induced diarrhoea or under control conditions. Ingestion of an isoosmotic laxative increased stool output from 1.1 (0.7-2.3) (median (range)) to 8 (5-19) bowel movements per day with no significant differences between men and women. In women rectal sensitivity was significantly increased after diarrhoea compared with control conditions (vol to induce discomfort (ml): 116 (96, 136) v 153 (137, 168), mean (95% CI); p < 0.001). This was associated with a reduction in the volume to induce internal anal sphincter relaxation (16 (12, 20) v 28 (21, 36); p < 0.005), and volume to induce sustained internal anal sphincter relaxation (70 (56, 84) v 90 (67, 113); p < 0.03), but no significant change in rectal compliance (ml/cm H2O at 100 ml) 4.8 (3.5, 6.1) v 4.1 (3.0, 5.1) or distension induced motility (motility index) 994 (341, 1647) v 735 (46, 1424). Conversely, in men diarrhoea had no significant effect on anorectal physiology and their control values were not significantly different from those of the women. In conclusion, the results of this study taken with the finding that irritable bowel syndrome is more common in women, suggests that the male or female sex hormonal environment may be an important factor in allowing the gut to be sensitised to noxious stimuli.

GFI1 and GFI1B control the loss of endothelial identity of hemogenic endothelium during hematopoietic commitment.
Recent studies have established that during embryonic development, hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells are generated from hemogenic endothelium precursors through a process termed endothelial to hematopoietic transition (EHT). The transcription factor RUNX1 is essential for this process, but its main downstream effectors remain largely unknown. Here, we report the identification of Gfi1 and Gfi1b as direct targets of RUNX1 and critical regulators of EHT. GFI1 and GFI1B are able to trigger, in the absence of RUNX1, the down-regulation of endothelial markers and the formation of round cells, a morphologic change characteristic of EHT. Conversely, blood progenitors in Gfi1- and Gfi1b-deficient embryos maintain the expression of endothelial genes. Moreover, those cells are not released from the yolk sac and disseminated into embryonic tissues. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a critical and specific role of the GFI1 transcription factors in the first steps of the process leading to the generation of hematopoietic progenitors from hemogenic endothelium.

[exercise, adherence, hf, study]

What strategies are effective for exercise adherence in heart failure? A systematic review of controlled studies.
Physical activity is recommended for people with stable heart failure (HF), because it is known to improve quality of life and health outcomes. However, adherence to this recommendation has been poor in many studies. A systematic review was conducted to examine the effectiveness of strategies used to promote exercise adherence in those with HF. The following databases were searched for relevant literature published between January 1980 and December 2010: British Nursing Index; CINAHL; Cochrane Library; Embase; Medline and PsycINFO. Papers with a control group focused on adults with HF that measured exercise or physical activity adherence were included. Nine randomised controlled trials were identified, involving a total of 3,231 patients (range 16-2,331). Six of these studies were informed by specific psychological theories. Positive outcomes occurred in the short-term from interventions using approaches such as exercise prescriptions, goal setting, feedback and problem-solving. However, longer-term maintenance of exercise was less successful. There was some support for interventions underpinned by theoretical frameworks, but more research is required to make clearer recommendations. Addressing self-efficacy in relation to exercise may be a particularly useful area to consider in this respect.

Mutant analysis of luminescence and autoinduction in a marine bacterium
The marine symbiotic bacterium Vibrio fischeri is striking for its ability both to emit light
and to dramatically regulate light emission using a cell-to-cell signalling mechanism
called autoinduction. The latter is mediated by a signal molecule called the
"autoinducer". The mechanistic bases of both luminescence and autoinduction are well
known in V. fischeri, but this knowledge is mostly derived from studies of the cloned
luminescence and autoinduction genes expressed in Escherichia coli. In this study,
luminescence and autoinduction mutations were systematically generated in V. fischeri to
explore aspects of luminescence and autoinduction not addressable in E. coli, such as the
adaptive significance of luminescence. Most dramatically, the mutants revealed the
presence of multiple autoinducers and autoinducer synthases in V. fischeri. One of the
autoinducers (autoinducer-2, or AI-2) was chemically purified and shown to be Noctanoyi-
L-homoserine lactone. The genetic locus encoding the AI-2 synthase was
cloned and designated ain (autoinducer). Manipulation of ain and AI-2 in V. jischeri
demonstrated that the function of AI-2 appears to be to inhibit rather than to promote
autoinduction.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution December 1994The

Corneal confocal microscopy detects small-fiber neuropathy in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A patients.
Introduction: Although unmyelinated nerve fibers are affected in Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A) disease, they have not been studied in detail due to the invasive nature of the techniques needed to study them. We established alterations in C-fiber bundles of the cornea in patients with CMT1A using non-invasive corneal confocal microscopy (CCM). Methods: Twelve patients with CMT1A and 12 healthy control subjects underwent assessment of neuropathic symptoms and deficits, electrophysiology, quantitative sensory testing, corneal sensitivity, and corneal confocal microscopy. Results: Corneal sensitivity, corneal nerve fiber density, corneal nerve branch density, corneal nerve fiber length, and corneal nerve fiber tortuosity were significantly reduced in CMT1A patients compared with controls. There was a significant correlation between corneal sensation and CCM parameters with the severity of painful neuropathic symptoms, cold and warm thresholds, and median nerve CMAP amplitude. Conclusions: CCM demonstrates significant damage to C-fiber bundles, which relates to some measures of neuropathy in CMT1A patients. Muscle Nerve, 2012.

Comparing the short and ultrashort pulsed laser ablation of LiF
<p>Pulsed laser ablation of LiF was studied using both nanosecond (ns) and femtosecond (fs) pulses at 248 nm. Optical emission from electronically excited Li and F atoms in the plume of ejected material was investigated by wavelength, time and spatially resolved imaging methods. Careful analysis of images of species selected optical emission yielded estimates of the mean velocities of the Li+ ions arising in both excitation schemes (similar to11 and similar to13 km/s, respectively), and highlighted the dramatic effects of radiation trapping, most notably by the reabsorption of Li(2p--&gt;2s) emission by ground state Li atoms in the ns ablation studies. Plumes formed by fs excitation are found to contain a higher fraction of energetic/electrically excited components, including excited F atoms and ions, indicative of an explosive boiling mechanism, whereas the ablation plume resulting from ns ablation is deduced to arise primarily from thermal evaporation of the transiently heated target surface. The amount of target material removed per shot is significantly less in the case of fs excitation. The density (and size) of unwanted droplets in films grown by fs ablation is much smaller than in the case of ns ablation, especially on substrates mounted in an off-axis ablation geometry, implying that hydrodynamic sputtering is much reduced by the use of short pulses and that fs ablation must be the preferred route to forming very thin LiF coatings.</p>

We present the case of a 38-year-old man who presented to the ENT clinic with cervical lymphadenopathy, oral ulceration, and generalized rash. He was diagnosed with syphilis after serologic testing. After years of decline, the incidence of syphilis is now increasing. It is unusual for patients to present to the otolaryngologist, but the recent marked increase in the incidence of syphilis in the UK is likely to translate into a greater incidence of pathology in the head and neck region. Knowledge of the condition, along with its head and neck manifestations, remains central to the diagnosis of this treatable infection.

The yeast vacuolar membrane proteome
Transport of solutes between the cytosol and the vacuolar lumen is of crucial importance for various functions of vacuoles, including ion homeostasis; detoxification; storage of different molecules such as amino acids, phosphate, and calcium ions; and proteolysis. To identify proteins that catalyze solute transport across the vacuolar membrane, the membrane proteome of purified Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuoles was analyzed. Subtractive proteomics was used to distinguish contaminants from true vacuolar proteins by comparing the relative abundances of proteins in pure and crude preparations. A robust statistical analysis combining enrichment ranking with the double boundary iterative group analysis revealed that 148 proteins were significantly enriched in the pure vacuolar preparations. Among these proteins were well characterized vacuolar proteins, such as the subunits of the vacuolar H+-ATPase, but also proteins that had not previously been assigned to a cellular location, many of which are likely novel vacuolar membrane transporters, e.g. for nucleosides and oligopeptides. Although the majority of contaminating proteins from other organelles were depleted from the pure vacuolar membranes, some proteins annotated to reside in other cellular locations were enriched along with the vacuolar proteins. In many cases the enrichment of these proteins is biologically relevant, and we discuss that a large group is involved in membrane fusion and protein trafficking to vacuoles and may have multiple localizations. Other proteins are degraded in vacuoles, and in some cases database annotations are likely to be incomplete or incorrect. Our work provides a wealth of information on vacuolar biology and a solid basis for further characterization of vacuolar functions. ?? 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

Firm Entry and Exit with Financial Frictions
This paper considers a model of firm dynamics to study the quantitative importance of financial frictions for the entry and exit of firms over the business cycle.  Firms face a working capital constraint in that they must pay wages and choose labor in advance.  The firm finances wages with a defaultable one-period non-contingent bond.  Financial frictions then introduce an external finance premium into the firm's cost of borrowing, which constrains the firm's demand for labor and influences the firm's entry and exit decisions through its effect on future profits.  I then measure a financial shock, which contributes to the external finance premium, from corporate bond spreads and feed it back into the model.  Under reasonable parameters, the model predicts that entry and exit rates are almost twice as sensitive to financial shocks than output and employment.  Moreover, historical financial shocks account for a third of cyclical movements in output and hours in the United States between 1953 and 2010.  They are an even stronger explanation for the first year of the Great Recession, accounting for more than half of the initial decline in output and hours, a third of the decline in entry rates and a fifth of the increase in exit rates.

Electron-impact excitation of neutral boron using the R-matrix with pseudostates method
<p>We have carried out a large R-matrix with pseudostates (RMPS) calculation of the electron-impact excitation of neutral boron. The RMPS method has been employed for the excitation/ionisation of many light fusion related species, but primarily for one or two active electrons. The present 640-term close-coupling calculation included three distinct pseudostate expansions. This enabled us to converge both the N-electron structure for three active open-shell electrons and accurately represent the high Rydberg and target continuum states. The derived Maxwell-averaged effective collision strengths will be employed to model the spectral emission from boron, which is of importance to both current (TEXTOR)and future (ITER) magnetic fusion reactors.

Practical experience of ustekinumab in the treatment of psoriasis: experience from a multicentre, retrospective case cohort study across the U.K. and Ireland.
BACKGROUND: There are limited data on the use of ustekinumab outside of clinical trials. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of ustekinumab in patients with severe psoriasis attending 10 dermatology centres in the U.K. and Ireland. METHODS: A retrospective case-note review of 129 patients with psoriasis treated with ustekinumab. RESULTS: Baseline Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) was 22·9±10·1 (mean±SD). After 16weeks of treatment with ustekinumab PASI 75 (75% reduction in PASI) was observed in 63·0% (n=80/127) of patients, although four patients required concomitant therapy at the 16-week time point. Previous biologic use did show a small, non-significant trend towards treatment failure. A PASI 75 response was seen in 29·4% (n=5/17) of individuals weighing 90-100kg and treated with the standard 45mg ustekinumab dose compared with PASI 75 of 70·3%, 71·4%, 75·0% and 55·6% for weight groups <80, 80-90, 100-110 and >110kg, respectively (P=0·024). Ustekinumab therapy was well tolerated; serious adverse events were observed in 2·3% (n=3/129) of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Ustekinumab is a novel biologic agent for psoriasis. When used in everyday clinical practice it demonstrates high levels of short-term therapeutic efficacy with an acceptable short-term safety profile.

PERIODIC DISTURBANCE REJECTION OF NONLINEAR SYSTEMS
Disturbance rejection is an important topic in control design since disturbances are inevitable in practical systems. To realise this target for nonlinear systems, this thesis brings in an assumption about the existence of a controlled invariant mani- fold and a Desired Feedforward Control (DFC) which is contained in the input to compensate the influence of disturbances. According to the approximation property of Neural Networks (NN) that any periodic signals defined in a compact set can be approximated by NN, the NN-based disturbance approximator is applied to approximate the DFC. Algorithmically, two important types of NN approximators that are Multi-layer Neural Networks (MNN) and Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNN) are presented in detail.In this thesis, a variety of nonlinear systems in standard canonical form are looked into. These forms are the output feedback form, the extended output feedback form, the decentralised output feedback form and the partial state feedback form. For these systems, four types of uncertainties are mainly considered. The first one is the disturbance that can be eliminated by the DFC. Secondly, the parameter uncertainty is taken into account. To get rid of this uncertainty, the adaptive control technique is employed for the estimation of unknown parameters, e.g. the NN gain matrix. The third one is the nonlinear uncertainty. For the case that nonlinear uncertainties are polynomials, it has a bound consisting of an unknown constant and a function of the regulated error such that this uncertainty can be also treated as the parameter uncertainty. Delay is the last type of uncertainty. Particularly, the delay is supposed to appear in output only. This uncertainty can be eliminated together with the nonlinear uncertainty. To establish the closed- loop stability, a Lyapunov-Krasovskii function is invoked. In addition, due to the requirement of the system structure or the stability analysis, some general control techniques are also involved such like the backstepping control and the high gain control.Throughout the results are illustrated by simulations.

Immobilization of cell-binding peptides on poly-ε-caprolactone film surface to biomimic the peripheral nervous system.
AbstractCell-material interactions are crucial for cell adhesion and proliferation on biomaterial surfaces. Immobilization of biomolecules leads to the formation of biomimetic substrates, improving cell response. We introduced RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) sequences on poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) film surfaces using thiol chemistry to enhance Schwann cell (SC) response. XPS elemental analysis indicated an estimate of 2-3% peptide functionalization on the PCL surface, comparable with carbodiimide chemistry. Contact angle was not remarkably reduced; hence, cell response was only affected by chemical cues on the film surface. Adhesion and proliferation of Schwann cells were enhanced after PCL modification. Particularly, RGD immobilization increased cell attachment up to 40% after 6 h of culture. It was demonstrated that SC morphology changed from round to very elongated shape when surface modification was carried out, with an increase in the length of cellular processes up to 50% after 5 days of culture. Finally RGD immobilization triggered the formation of focal adhesion related to higher cell spreading. In summary, this study provides a method for immobilization of biomolecules on PCL films to be used in peripheral nerve repair, as demonstrated by the enhanced response of Schwann cells.

Electrochemical and surface analytical studies of enargite in acid solution.
The electrochem. oxidn. and redn. of the surface of natural enargite (Cu3AsS4) was studied in 0.1M HCl soln. using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. Surface anal. by ex situ XPS and in situ Raman spectroscopy, together with aq. phase anal. by inductively coupled plasma-at. emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), were used to aid in the interpretation of the electrochem. behavior of this complex system. XPS analyses on enargite oxidized at potentials >0.2 V (SCE) detected the presence of CuII surface species, with assocd. sulfate and chloride. At potentials <0.6 V (SCE), oxidn. of As was detected with possible minor amts. of AsV at higher potentials. Anal. of the electrolyte in contact with enargite showed that the amt. of dissolved S increased under reducing potentials due to H2S formation and at oxidizing potentials due to the formation of sulfoxy species. The amt. of dissolved Cu increased at potentials >0.2 V (SCE), whereas dissolved As concns. were negligible over the entire potential range studied. Raman spectroscopy provided addnl. evidence of elemental S formation at oxidizing potentials at which sulfate forming reactions occurred in parallel.

Effect of Fluorine Implantation Dose on Boron Thermal Diffusion in Silicon
<p>This paper investigates how the thermal diffusion of boron in silicon is influenced by a high energy fluorine implant with a dose in the range 5x10(14)-2.3x10(15) cm(-2). Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS) profiles of boron marker layers are presented for different fluorine doses and compared with fluorine profiles to establish the conditions under which thermal boron diffusion is suppressed. The (SIMS) profiles show significantly reduced boron thermal diffusion above a critical F+ dose of 0.9-1.4x10(15) cm(-2). Fitting of the measured boron profiles gives suppressions of the boron thermal diffusion coefficient by factors of 1.9 and 3.7 for F+ implantation doses of 1.4x10(15) and 2.3x10(15) cm(-2), respectively. The suppression of boron thermal diffusion above the critical fluorine dose correlates with the appearance of a shallow fluorine peak on the (SIMS) profile in the vicinity of the boron marker layer. This shallow fluorine peak is present in samples with and without boron marker layers, and hence it is not due to a chemical interaction between the boron and the fluorine. Analysis of the (SIMS) profiles and cross-section Transmission Electron Microscope micrographs suggests that it is due to the trapping of fluorine at vacancy-fluorine clusters, and that the suppression of the boron thermal diffusion is due to the effect of the clusters in suppressing the interstitial concentration in the vicinity of the boron profile</p>

[cell, lung, ox40, immune]

A critical role for OX40 in T cell-mediated immunopathology during lung viral infection.
Respiratory infections are the third leading cause of death worldwide. Illness is caused by pathogen replication and disruption of airway homeostasis by excessive expansion of cell numbers. One strategy to prevent lung immune-mediated damage involves reducing the cellular burden. To date, antiinflammatory strategies have affected both antigen-specific and naive immune repertoires. Here we report a novel form of immune intervention that specifically targets recently activated T cells alone. OX40 (CD134) is absent on naive T cells but up-regulated 1-2 d after antigen activation. OX40-immunoglobulin fusion proteins block the interaction of OX40 with its ligand on antigen-presenting cells and eliminate weight loss and cachexia without preventing virus clearance. Reduced proliferation and enhanced apoptosis of lung cells accompanied the improved clinical phenotype. Manipulation of this late costimulatory pathway has clear therapeutic potential for the treatment of dysregulated lung immune responses.

Beam excited signals available at the HOM coupler ports of superconducting accelerating cavities cover a wide frequency range and carry information about (amongst others) the transverse beam position. Downmixing these signals using detector diodes is a mean to measure the time dependence of the power leaving the HOM coupler with standard and non-specific oscilloscope technology. Experiments undertaken at the accelerator modules ACC1 and ACC39 at FLASH demonstrated the possibility to extract beam position data out of low frequency signals sampled with such a setup.

<p>Two liquid composite moulding techniques have been investigated in this study, resin transfer moulding (RTM) and resin infusion under flexible tool (RIFT) for the processing of glass fabricepoxy laminates with 5% nanoaggregates of silica nanoparticles in the epoxy matrix. It has been found that the high fibre fraction reinforcement (V-f=0.50) filters the silica nanoaggregates resulting in stopping the in plane resin infiltration in RTM right at the beginning of the filling stage. Laminates of lower fibre fraction (V-f=0.40) were produced successfully by RIFT. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) and three point bend tests showed that fibre-silica-epoxy composites, processed by RIFT, had higher elastic shear modulus and interlaminar shear strength than conventional fibre-epoxy composites manufactured by the same RIFT process.</p>

Temperature-dependence of creep behavior of dental resin-composites.
Objectives:To determine the effect of temperature, over a clinically relevant range, on the creep behaviour of a set of conventional and flowable resin-composites including two subgroups having the same resin matrix and varied filler loading.Methods:Eight dental resin-composites: four flowable and four conventional were investigated. Stainless steel split moulds (4 mm × 6 mm) were used to prepare cylindrical specimens for creep examination. Specimens were irradiated in the moulds in layers of 2 mm thickness (40 s each), as well as from the radial direction after removal from the moulds, using a light-curing unit with irradiance of 650 mW/cm2. A total of 15 specimens from each material were prepared and divided into three groups (n = 5) according to the temperature; Group I: (23 °C), Group II: (37 °C) and Group III: (45 °C). Each specimen was loaded (20 MPa) for 2 h and unloaded for 2 h. Creep was measured continuously over the loading and unloading periods.Results:At higher temperatures greater creep and permanent set were recorded. The lowest mean creep occurred with GS and GH resin-composites. Percentage of creep recovery decreased at higher temperatures. At 23 °C, the materials exhibited comparable creep. At 37 °C and 45 °C, however, there was a greater variation between materials. For all resin-composites, there was a strong linear correlation with temperature for both creep and permanent set.Conclusions:Creep parameters of resin-composites are sensitive to temperature increase from 23 to 45 °C, as can occur intra-orally. For a given resin matrix, creep decreased with higher filler loading.

Specific β-containing Integrins Exert Differential Control on Proliferation and Two-dimensional Collective Cell Migration in Mammary Epithelial Cells
Understanding how cell cycle is regulated in normal mammary epithelia is essential for deciphering defects of breast cancer and therefore for developing new therapies. Signals provided by both the extracellular matrix and growth factors are essential for epithelial cell proliferation. However, the mechanisms by which adhesion controls cell cycle in normal epithelia are poorly established. In this study, we describe the consequences of removing the β1-integrin gene from primary cultures of mammary epithelial cells in situ, using CreER. Upon β1-integrin gene deletion, the cells were unable to progress efficiently through S-phase, but were still able to undergo collective two-dimensional migration. These responses are explained by the presence of β3-integrin in β1-integrin-null cells, indicating that integrins containing different β-subunits exert differential control on mammary epithelial proliferation and migration. β1-Integrin deletion did not inhibit growth factor signaling to Erk or prevent the recruitment of core adhesome components to focal adhesions. Instead the S-phase arrest resulted from defective Rac activation and Erk translocation to the nucleus. Rac inhibition prevented Erk translocation and blocked proliferation. Activated Rac1 rescued the proliferation defect in β1-integrin-depleted cells, indicating that this GTPase is essential in propagating proliferative β1-integrin signals. These results show that β1-integrins promote cell cycle in mammary epithelial cells, whereas β3-integrins are involved in migration.

Intake of Omega-3 and Omega-6 Fatty Acids and Risk of Basal and Squamous Cell Carcinomas of the Skin: A Longitudinal Community-Based Study in Australian Adults.
Intake of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids may modify the risk of basal and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (BCC and SCC), but population-based evidence is limited and inconsistent. We examined prospectively associations between intake of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids estimated from food frequency questionnaires and BCC and SCC incidence among 1322 randomly selected adults in Nambour, Australia. Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated based on histologically confirmed tumors diagnosed between 1997 and 2007. Incidence of BCC was lowest in the middle third of both total omega-6 intake (RR(mv.adj) = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.56-0.97) and linoleic acid intake (RR(mv.adj) = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.57-0.99) compared with the lowest third of intake. Evidence for associations with SCC was weak, though persons with arachidonic acid intake in the middle third had a marginally increased risk of SCC (RR(mv.adj) = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.00-2.02). Consumption of omega-3 fatty acids was not associated with subsequent skin cancer risk. Suggestion that intake of arachidonic acid may be associated with increased SCC incidence and total omega-6 with reduced BCC from our study is still highly uncertain and may be due to chance. These data do not support an association between these fatty acids and risk of BCC or SCC.

Condor-COPASI: high-throughput computing for biochemical networks.
BACKGROUND: Mathematical modelling has become a standard technique to improve our understanding of complex biological systems. As models become larger and more complex, simulations and analyses require increasing amounts of computational power. Clusters of computers in a high-throughput computing environment can help to provide the resources required for computationally expensive model analysis. However, exploiting such a system can be difficult for users without the necessary expertise.

RESULTS: We present Condor-COPASI, a server-based software tool that integrates COPASI, a biological pathway simulation tool, with Condor, a high-throughput computing environment. Condor-COPASI provides a web-based interface, which makes it extremely easy for a user to run a number of model simulation and analysis tasks in parallel. Tasks are transparently split into smaller parts, and submitted for execution on a Condor pool. Result output is presented to the user in a number of formats, including tables and interactive graphical displays.

CONCLUSIONS: Condor-COPASI can effectively use a Condor high-throughput computing environment to provide significant gains in performance for a number of model simulation and analysis tasks. Condor-COPASI is free, open source software, released under the Artistic License 2.0, and is suitable for use by any institution with access to a Condor pool.

Why does Scotland have a higher suicide rate than England? An area-level investigation of health and social factors.
BACKGROUND: Up until the mid-late 2000s, the national suicide rate in Scotland was the highest among all the UK countries, but the reasons for this phenomenon are poorly understood. METHODS: In a multilevel study of suicide risk in Scotland and England during 2001-2006, the authors examined a range of social, cultural and health-related factors at small area level: postcode sector and Health Board in Scotland and ward and Primary Care Organisation in England. RESULTS: Scotland's national suicide rate was 79% higher than in England (rate ratio 1.79, 95% CI 1.62 to 1.98), with younger male and female Scots aged 15-44 years having double the risk compared with their English peers. Overall, 57% of the excess suicide risk in Scotland was explained by a range of area-level measures, including prescriptions for psychotropic drugs, alcohol and drug use, socioeconomic deprivation, social fragmentation, and other health-related indices. The use of psychotropic drugs, acting as a proxy measure for mental ill health, was the variable most strongly associated with the between-country differences in suicide risk. Alcohol misuse also made an important contribution to the differentials. Overall, the contribution of socioeconomic deprivation and social fragmentation was relatively small. CONCLUSIONS: Any attempt to reverse the divergent trend in suicide between Scotland and England will require initiatives to prevent and treat mental ill health and to tackle alcohol and drug misuse. Differences in prescribing rates, however, may also be explained by differences in illness behaviour or the availability of psychosocial interventions, and addressing these may also reduce Scotland's excess risk.

An Architecture For Shared Multi-User Client Rendering Of Massive Geodatasets
We are developing a novel data-centric visualization architecture to allow interactive exploration of geophysical data. Our method allows multiple users to collaborate in a lightweight, loosely-coupled and highly scalable environment. We choose 3D seismic data for our case study. Existing visualization solutions for data exploratory tasks are mainly application-centric rather than data-centric. They typically store large datasets on users’ local machines for fast access. Additionally, data objects that are the focus of study, e.g. seismic surveys and interpreted geological features, are managed as objects that are independent of the primary data. Thus multi-user collaborations where different users visually share their geological interpretations are handled inefficiently since objects from each interpretation are stored as independent discrete objects. These objects may be stored separately from the primary data, e.g. on local disks, ensuring a coherent multi-user view is difficult. Our visual analytic method places a central data structure built on a Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) relational database at the heart of the visualization architecture. This structure allows us to develop the following efficient methods for data retrieval and display: -global hashing for spatial reference on all datasets -interpretation tagging which accumulate user interpretation into the database -multi-user concurrent access allowing parallel multi-threading queries In our data structure, data elements are indexed on their geolocations by a hashing algorithm. The hashing algorithm determines the location of the required row through hashing functions without a construction or any storage complexity. This is unlike other conventional indexing algorithms such as bitmapping or tree-based methods where construction and storage (of the index table) complexity varies between O(n) and O(n log n) where n is the size of the dataset. Also, we replace the geometric objects formed as a result of user geological interpretations with what we call ‘features’. A feature is a logical subset of the original data with each key-value pair tagged as belonging to a particular spatial feature. Thus, instead of a surface being considered as composed of polygons it is now a tagged subset of the data. Our architecture requires an intermediate stage which builds in real-time a volume in a format which can be directly rendered on a client GPU. We call this a Feature-Embedded Spatial Volume (FESVo). In this stage we utilize the indexing and parallel capabilities of the database to perform parallel queries, and on-the-fly down-sampling if lower resolution is required, at a complexity of O(k), where k is the number of data units fetched from the database, similar to searching complexity with the bitmapping index method. Also, user interactions with the visualization are saved back to the database as point tags allowing immediate knowledge sharing. We present a technical and functional architecture for a data-centric approach and how it scales to overcome access and analytical latency in client-server data interactions. Preliminary experimental evaluation shows potential advantages of such a system in terms of security and centralised data management for subsurface data visualization systems. Also, we believe that our architecture can lead to a web-based visualization environment for geoscientific data.

The cardioprotective effect of urocortin during ischaemia/reperfusion involves the prevention of mitochondrial damage.
We have previously shown, using Affymetrix gene chip technology, that urocortin induces the expression of several diverse genes in cardiac myocytes. An ATP sensitive inwardly rectifying potassium channel, Katp (Kir6.1), the enzyme calcium independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2), and protein kinase C epsilon (PKCepsilon) and that these genes are involved in the cardioprotective mechanism of action of urocortin. Here we demonstrate that these gene products are localized to cardiac myocyte mitochondria and for the first time show that urocortin protects cardiac myocytes from ischaemia/reperfusion induced cell death by preventing mitochondrial damage. Using pharmacological agents to Katp channels and iPLA2 and synthetic peptide inhibitors of PKCepsilon, we go on to demonstrate that these three gene products are involved in the urocortin induced protection of cardiac myocyte mitochondria. These proteins may interact at the mitochondria to produce the protective effect.

N-linked carbohydrate on human leukocyte antigen-C and recognition by natural killer cell inhibitory receptors.
The possible role of carbohydrate in the interaction of HLA-C with a human inhibitory natural Killer cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptor with two Ig domains, KIR2DL1, was investigated. Transfectants of 721.221 (a class I MHC-negative human B cell line) expressing only HLA-Cw4 or -Cw6 or their respective non-glycosylated mutants (N86Q, S88A) were made. The binding of a KIR2DL1-Ig fusion protein to the non-glycosylated mutant HLA-Cw4- or -Cw6-expressing cells was markedly decreased compared to the wild type-expressing cells. The ability to induce an inhibitory signal in the NK tumor line YTS transfected with KIR2DL1 was also impaired in the nonglycosylated mutant expressing cells. Furthermore, in a second functional assay, mutant HLA-Cw4 and -Cw6 molecules had impaired ability to induce signal transduction in BW cells expressing a KIR2DL1-CD3 zeta chain chimeric protein. Thus, the deletion of the N-linked glycosylation signal in HLA-Cw4 and -Cw6 greatly reduced recognition by KIR2DL1. Alternative interpretations of the data are discussed.

Development of the BASS rake acoustic current sensor : measuring velocity in the continental shelf wave bottom boundary layer
Surface swell over the continental shelf generates a sheet of oscillatory shear flow at
the base of the water column, the continental shelf wave bottom boundary layer. The
short periods of surface swell sharply limit the thickness of the wave boundary layer,
confining it to a thin region below an oscillatory, but essentially irrotational, core. For
a wide range of shelf conditions, the vertical extent of the wave boundary layer does
not exceed 2.5 cm and is commonly less. The extreme narrowness of this boundary
layer is responsible for high levels of bottom stress and turbulent dissipation. Even in
relatively mild sea states, the wave induced bottom shear stress can be sufficient to
initiate sediment motion. The wave bottom boundary layer plays an important role
in the processes of sediment entrainment and transport on the continental margins.
This thesis documents the development, testing, and field use of a new instrument,
the BASS Rake, designed to measure velocity profiles in the wave boundary layer.
The mechanical design supports multiple measurement levels with millimeter vertical
spacing. The mechanical design is integrated with an electronic interface designed to
permit flexible acquisition of a suite of horizontal and vertical velocity measurements
without sacrificing the electronic characteristics necessary for high measurement accuracy. The effects of velocity averaging over the sample volume are calculated with
a model of acoustic propagation in a scattering medium appropriate to the scales of
a single differential travel time axis. A simpler parametric model of the averaging
process is then developed and used to specify the transducer characteristics necessary
to image the wave boundary layer on the continental shelf.
A flow distortion model for the sensor head is developed and the empirical determinations
of the Reynolds number, Keulegan-Carpenter number, and angular dependencies
of the sensor response for the laboratory and field prototypes is presented.
The calibrated sensor response of the laboratory prototype is tested against concurrent
LDV measurements over a natural sand bed in a flume. The single measurement
accuracy of the BASS Rake is higher than that of the LDV and the multiple sample volumes confer other advantages. For example, the ability of the BASS Rake to image
vertically coherent turbulent instabilities, invisible to the LDV, is demonstrated.
Selected data from a twenty-four day field deployment outside the surf zone of a local
beach are presented and analyzed. The data reveal regular reworking of the sand
bed, the generation and modification of sand ripples, and strong tidal modulation of
the current and wave velocities on semi-diurnal, diurnal, and spring/neap time scales.
The data set is unique in containing concurrent velocity time series, of several weeks
duration, with coverage from 1 cm to 20 cm above the bottom.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution June 1997ONR has contributed

A Frequency Tuning Method for a Planar Inverted-F Antenna
<p>A novel method is presented for electrically tuning the frequency of a planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA). A tuning circuit, comprising an RF switch and discrete passive components, has been completely integrated into the antenna element, which is thus free of dc wires. The proposed tuning method has been demonstrated with a dual-band PIFA capable of operating in four frequency bands. The antenna covers the GSM850, GSM900, GSM1800, PCS1900 and UNITS frequency ranges with over 40% total efficiency. The impact of the tuning circuit on the antenna's efficiency and radiation pattern have been experimentally studied through comparison with the performance of a reference antenna not incorporating the tuning circuit. The proposed frequency tuning concept can be extended to more complex PIFA structures as well as other types of antennas to give enhanced electrical performance.</p>

Dendritic cells and the assessment in vitro of skin sensitizing potential.
It is now well established that dendritic cells (DC) play pivotal roles in the initiation and orchestration of adaptive immune responses, including cutaneous immune responses to chemical allergens that drive the acquisition of skin sensitization. It is not unexpected, therefore, that a large number, and wide variety, of proposed approaches for the identification of skin sensitizing chemicals in vitro are based upon the use of cultured DC or DC-like cells. The use of DC in this context is legitimate. However, with our rapidly increasing understanding of the diversity of cutaneous DC with respect to both phenotype and function, it is timely now to review briefly the potential limitations and interpretive difficulties that are associated with the use of DC-based assays. Among the important considerations are the fact that chemical-induced changes in the characteristics and function of cultured DC will not necessarily reflect accurately the events that that support the development of skin sensitization in vivo. In addition, most DC-based assays are predicated on a view that cutaneous DC have as their primary function the initiation of adaptive immune responses. However, it is now appreciated that cutaneous DC, and in particular epidermal Langerhans cells (LC), may also play important immunoregulatory roles that serve to limit and contain skin immune responses. Notwithstanding these considerations there is reason to believe that at least some in vitro DC-based assays are of value, and indeed some are currently the subject of a formal validation process. However, it is appropriate that such assays are configured and interpreted carefully, and with an appreciation of the complexity of DC biology.

The research conducted here presents the development of a new approach to this problem by analysing a transposon insertion mutant library constructed in an alginate-producing derivative of the Pseudomonas fluorescens strain SBW25. The procedure is based on the non-destructive and reagent-free method of Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy which is used to generate a complex biochemical infrared fingerprint of the medium after bacterial growth. First, we investigate the potential differences caused by the growth media fructose and glycerol on the bacterial phenotype and alginate synthesis in 193 selected P. fluorescens mutants and show that clear phenotypic differences are observed in the infrared fingerprints. In order to quantify the level of the alginate we also report the construction and interpretation of multivariate partial least squares regression models which were able to quantify alginate levels successfully with typical normalized root-mean-square error in predictions of only approximately 14%. We have demonstrated that this high-throughput approach can be implemented in alginate screens and we believe that this FT-IR spectroscopic methodology, when combined with the most appropriate chemometrics, could easily be modified for the quantification of other valuable microbial products and play a valuable screening role for synthetic biology.

Streamer characteristic and breakdown in synthetic and natural ester transformer liquids with pressboard interface under lightning impulse voltage
This paper presents experimental studies on streamer and breakdown of synthetic and natural ester liquids with the presence of pressboard interface in a divergent point-plane field under lightning impulse voltage. Based on the current, light signals and streamer images, characteristics of both positive and negative streamers on pressboard surface were described, which resemble the features of streamers in open liquid gaps. Introducing pressboard in parallel does not influence the streamer stopping length and thus not weaken the oil gap breakdown voltage, under both positive and negative polarities at gap distances up to 75 mm. However, presence of parallel pressboard significantly reduces the acceleration voltage in mineral oil but seems have no influence on ester liquids under positive polarity, while it tends to accelerate the streamer velocity at larger gap distance and under higher voltage in both ester liquids and mineral oil under negative polarity. Generally, streamer on ester/pressboard interface propagates further than on mineral oil/pressboard interface at the same voltage level; both breakdown voltage and acceleration voltage on ester/pressboard interface are lower than those on mineral oil/pressboard interface at the investigated gap distances up to 75 mm. ?? 2011 IEEE.

Aspergillus genomes and the Aspergillus cloud.
Aspergillus Genomes is a public resource for viewing annotated genes predicted by various Aspergillus sequencing projects. It has arisen from the union of two significant resources: the Aspergillus/Aspergillosis website and the Central Aspergillus Data REpository (CADRE). The former has primarily served the medical community, providing information about Aspergillus and associated diseases to medics, patients and scientists; the latter has focused on the fungal genomic community, providing a central repository for sequences and annotation extracted from Aspergillus Genomes. By merging these databases, genomes benefit from extensive cross-linking with medical information to create a unique resource, spanning genomics and clinical aspects of the genus. Aspergillus Genomes is accessible from http://www.aspergillus-genomes.org.uk.

Benchmarking the business performance of departmental space in universities
Purpose and Theory:
In UK higher education institutions, facilities management performance tends to be measured in
space utilisation and space cost. A new approach uses the  return on investment  (ROI) concept
of income generation to highlight space performance at faculty/department/building level.<p></p>
Design and approach:
Using space data from several English universities and data envelopment analysis (DEA), six
types of academic units (departments, institutes or similar) are compared in regard of their
respective research and teaching income. This technique allows mapping out the total  envelope 
with the best performers at the edge, showing what improvement/change would be needed for
the others in the group to match their performance.<p></p>
Findings:
This is a viable method of benchmarking and gives participating institutions better and more
strategic and business-oriented feedback on the performance of their space envelope than mere
cost comparisons. It can potentially inform strategic decisions about university estates. However,
there are barriers to applying this approach: problems posed by issues of classification and
diverse organisational structures can be overcome, but lack of collaboration of facilities/estates
and finance directorates; lack of centralised, accurate and detailed data pose more serious
challenges.

Design and analysis of non-pharmacological treatment trials with multiple therapists per patient
In trials of physical and talking therapies, nesting of patients within therapists has statistical implications analogous to those of cluster randomised trials. Nevertheless, the clustering effect may be more complex, as it interacts with treatment. For some therapies, individual patients may receive care from multiple therapists of the same type, so that patients are no longer strictly nested within therapists, creating a ‘multiple-membership’ relationship between patients and therapists.This paper considers methods of analysis and sample size estimation for trials with multiple-membership clustering effects. It is motivated by a trial of a psychotherapy for the treatment of adolescent depression with cognitive behavioural therapy. We tested methods and issues in a Monte Carlo simulation study, simulating trials with multiple membership. Results demonstrate satisfactory performance in terms of convergence and give estimates of the intra-cluster correlation coefficient and empirical test size similar to a simple hierarchical design.We derive formulae for sample size and power for multiple-membership trial designs. We then compare estimates of power from this formula with empirical power derived from the simulation study. Finally, we show that we can easily extend formulae for sample size and power to allow consideration of power and sample size for certain types of more complex interventions. These include situations where therapists of different types deliver separate components of the intervention, creating a cross-classified relationship, or where several therapists deliver a group-administered treatment, creating further levels.

Diagnosis of lung cancer – improving survival rates
Lung cancer is a major global health burden with high incidence rates but poor long-term survival. Currently, the majority of cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage when surgical resection is not feasible. Screening for lung cancer has been a major focus of research for the last 40 years. Despite this, there is still a lack of evidence to promote its use outside clinical trials. More recently, interest has focused on promoting earlier recognition of symptomatic disease among both the general public and primary care physicians in order to encourage more timely investigation and referral to secondary care. The hope is that this approach may increase the proportion of disease identified in the early tages, allowing more surgical resections and improved five-year survival rates. This article provides an overview of the current evidence base in terms of early diagnosis of lung cancer and provides some examples of innovations to promote this.

Role of CCL11 in eosinophilic lung disease during respiratory syncytial virus infection.
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major viral pathogen of infants and the elderly. Significant morbidity is caused by an overexuberant mixed lung cell infiltrate, which is thought to be driven by chemokines. One of the main chemotactic mediators responsible for the movement of eosinophils is CCL11 (eotaxin). Using a mouse model of eosinophilic bronchiolitis induced by RSV, we show here that treatment in vivo with a blocking antibody to CCL11 greatly reduces lung eosinophilia and disease severity. In addition, anti-CCL11 caused a striking inhibition of CD4-T-cell influx and shifted cytokine production away from interleukin-5 without reducing the resistance to viral replication. These results suggest that in addition to influencing eosinophil diapedesis and survival, anti-CCL11 has an action on T cells. These studies strengthen the case for anti-CCL11 treatment of Th2-driven diseases.

Microarray challenges in ecology
Microarrays are used to measure simultaneously the amount of mRNAs transcribed from many genes. They were originally designed for gene expression profiling in relatively simple biological systems, such as cell lines and model systems under constant laboratory conditions. This poses a challenge to ecologists who increasingly want to use microarrays to unravel the genetic mechanisms underlying complex interactions among organisms and between organisms and their environment. Here, we discuss typical experimental and statistical problems that arise when analyzing genome-wide expression profiles in an ecological context. We show that experimental design and environmental confounders greatly influence the identification of candidate genes in ecological microarray studies, and that following several simple recommendations could facilitate the analysis of microarray data in ecological settings. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

ICOS controls Foxp3(+) regulatory T-cell expansion, maintenance and IL-10 production during helminth infection.
Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells are key immune regulators during helminth infections, and identifying the mechanisms governing their induction is of principal importance for the design of treatments for helminth infections, allergies and autoimmunity. Little is yet known regarding the co-stimulatory environment that favours the development of Foxp3(+) Treg-cell responses during helminth infections. As recent evidence implicates the co-stimulatory receptor ICOS in defining Foxp3(+) Treg-cell functions, we investigated the role of ICOS in helminth-induced Foxp3(+) Treg-cell responses. Infection of ICOS(-/-) mice with Heligmosomoides polygyrus or Schistosoma mansoni led to a reduced expansion and maintenance of Foxp3(+) Treg cells. Moreover, during H. polygyrus infection, ICOS deficiency resulted in increased Foxp3(+) Treg-cell apoptosis, a Foxp3(+) Treg-cell specific impairment in IL-10 production, and a failure to mount putatively adaptive Helios(-) Foxp3(+) Treg-cell responses within the intestinal lamina propria. Impaired lamina propria Foxp3(+) Treg-cell responses were associated with increased production of IL-4 and IL-13 by CD4(+) T cells, demonstrating that ICOS dominantly downregulates Type 2 responses at the infection site, sharply contrasting with its Type 2-promoting effects within lymphoid tissue. Thus, ICOS regulates Type 2 immunity in a tissue-specific manner, and plays a key role in driving Foxp3(+) Treg-cell expansion and function during helminth infections.

Azole antifungal resistance today: focus on Aspergillus.
Oral triazole therapy is well established for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis (IPA), allergic aspergillosis (ABPA), and chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), and is often long-term. Resistance to triazole azole antifungal drugs in Aspergillus fumigatus is now a major clinical problem in a number of European locations, in China, Canada and the USA with particularly high frequencies from the north-west of the UK, and The Netherlands. A number of centers are reporting the continuing increasing frequency and evolution of resistance mechanisms in A. fumigatus, in both azole-naïve and patients treated with azoles. The increasing rate of resistance is of concern. A number of resistance mechanisms have been found. The biofilm modality of Aspergillus growth may have a number of therapeutic implications for aspergillosis, including antifungal resistance. Microbiological diagnosis of aspergillosis is limited by poor culture yield, leading to uncertainty about the frequency of triazole resistance. Direct resistance testing in culture-negative clinical samples may add additional insights into the prevalence of azole resistance in A. fumigatus.

Sustained desensitization to bacterial Toll-like receptor ligands after resolutionof respiratory influenza infection
The World Health Organization estimates that lower respiratory tract infections (excluding tuberculosis) account for approximately 35% of all deaths caused by infectious diseases. In many cases, the cause of death may be caused by multiple pathogens, e.g., the life-threatening bacterial pneumonia observed in patients infected with influenza virus. The ability to evolve more efficient immunity on each successive encounter with antigen is the hallmark of the adaptive immune response. However, in the absence of cross-reactive T and B cell epitopes, one lung infection can modify immunity and pathology to the next for extended periods of time. We now report for the first time that this phenomenon is mediated by a sustained desensitization of lung sentinel cells to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands; this is an effect that lasts for several months after resolution of influenza or respiratory syncytial virus infection and is associated with reduced chemokine production and NF-kappaB activation in alveolar macrophages. Although such desensitization may be beneficial in alleviating overall immunopathology, the reduced neutrophil recruitment correlates with heightened bacterial load during secondary respiratory infection. Our data therefore suggests that post-viral desensitization to TLR signals may be one possible contributor to the common secondary bacterial pneumonia associated with pandemic and seasonal influenza infection.

Distributed Load Balancing in Many-To-One Wireless Sensor Networks
A typical sensor network is conceived as being a very large collection of low-powered, homogeneous nodes that remain static post-deployment and forward sensed data to a single sink via multi-hop communication. For these types of networks there is an inherent funnelling effect whereby the nodes that can communicate directly with the sink must collectively forward the traffic of the entire network and therefore these nodes use more energy than the other nodes. This is known as the energy hole problem because after some time, these nodes deplete their batteries and leave an energy hole cutting the sink off from the network.In this thesis two new routing protocols are proposed that aim to maximise load balancing among these most critical nodes in order to maximise lifetime. They are the first fully distributed routing protocols that are designed to generate a load balanced routing tree to mitigate the energy hole problem. The results show that the better performing of the two is capable of creating a highly balanced tree at the cost of a small increase in latency.Although there have been other fully distributed protocols that aim at a similar form of load balancing, it is proven that the approach they take cannot guarantee perfect balance among the most critical nodes even in unrealistically generous scenarios. This suggests that they are not well suited to that task and the simulation results show that the novel protocols proposed in this thesis outperform the best of the alternatives.Before these protocols are proposed, the absolute reception-based blacklisting routing strategy is shown to be more energy efficient than previously thought and indeed more efficient than the strategy that has previously been considered optimal. This result is used to strongly justify the use of the unit disk graph model in simulations of sensor networks. Additionally, the relay hole problem in sensor networks is analysed for the first time.

Caveolin-1 (P132L), a common breast cancer mutation, confers mammary cell invasiveness and defines a novel stem cell/metastasis-associated gene signature.
Here we used the Met-1 cell line in an orthotopic transplantation model in FVB/N mice to dissect the role of the Cav-1(P132L) mutation in human breast cancer. Identical experiments were performed in parallel with wild-type Cav-1. Cav-1(P132L) up-regulated the expression of estrogen receptor-alpha as predicted, because only estrogen receptor-alpha-positive patients have been shown to harbor Cav-1(P132L) mutations. In the context of primary tumor formation, Cav-1(P132L) behaved as a loss-of-function mutation, lacking any tumor suppressor activity. In contrast, Cav-1(P132L) caused significant increases in cell migration, invasion, and experimental metastasis, consistent with a gain-of-function mutation. To identify possible molecular mechanism(s) underlying this invasive gain-of-function activity, we performed unbiased gene expression profiling. From this analysis, we show that the Cav-1(P132L) expression signature contains numerous genes that have been previously associated with cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. These include i) secreted growth factors and extracellular matrix proteins (Cyr61, Plf, Pthlh, Serpinb5, Tnc, and Wnt10a), ii) proteases that generate EGF and HGF (Adamts1 and St14), and iii) tyrosine kinase substrates and integrin signaling/adapter proteins (Akap13, Cdcp1, Ddef1, Eps15, Foxf1a, Gab2, Hs2st1, and Itgb4). Several of the P132L-specific genes are also highly expressed in stem/progenitor cells or are associated with myoepithelial cells, suggestive of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These results directly support clinical data showing that patients harboring Cav-1 mutations are more likely to undergo recurrence and metastasis.

[agr2, structure, adhesion, protein]

Metastasis-promoting anterior gradient 2 protein has a dimeric thioredoxin fold structure and a role in cell adhesion.
Anterior gradient 2 (AGR2) is a normal endoplasmic reticulum protein that has two important abnormal functions, amphibian limb regeneration and human cancer metastasis promotion. These normal intracellular and abnormal extracellular roles can be attributed to the multidomain structure of AGR2. The NMR structure shows that AGR2 consists of an unstructured N-terminal region followed by a thioredoxin fold. The protein exists in monomer-dimer equilibrium with a K(d) of 8.83μM, and intermolecular salt bridges involving E60 and K64 within the folded domain serve to stabilize the dimer. The unstructured region is primarily responsible for the ability of AGR2 to promote cell adhesion, while dimerization is less important for this activity. The structural data of AGR2 show a separation between potential catalytic redox activity and adhesion function within the context of metastasis and development.

Is there Equity in HPV vaccination and Cervical Screening in the North West of England? : A Study of Mothers and Daughters
IntroductionCervical screening uptake is steadily declining with evidence of inequalities by deprivation and ethnicity. The introduction of the HPV vaccination programme has the potential to reverse the downward trend in cervical cancer prevention by protecting girls who in future may not attend for cervical screening.ObjectiveTo investigate equity in cervical cancer prevention by examining uptake of adolescent HPV vaccination of daughters and cervical cancer screening attendance in their mothers. Methods HPV vaccination records of girls aged 12-13 years were linked by address to their mothers cervical screening records from 15 North West Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) (n = 24,409 mother-daughter pairs).  Vaccination and Screening records were matched to deprivation quintiles (as measured by the 2007 Index of Multiple Deprivation IMD scores) and ethnicity (classified by South Asian ethnicity using the Nam Pehchan computer programme). Results Results from preliminary analysis show daughters vaccination completion was associated with mothers screening attendance. Screening uptake was significantly lower in mothers whose daughters had received no vaccination doses compared to those that had received three doses (Odds Ratio OR = 1.35; 95% Confidence Interval CI 1.24 to 1.47) or partial immunisation status (OR=1.19; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.35).  Uptake of both vaccination and screening programmes were associated with deprivation quintile (Chi Square, p<0.0001) and ethnicity, with uptake significantly lower in South Asian groups (Cervical screening = Chi Square p<0.05, HPV vaccination p<0.0001).   Conclusion Mother’s behaviour towards cervical screening appears to be indicative of HPV uptake in daughters. The HPV vaccination programme may therefore be subject to the same inequalities in coverage as the cervical screening programme.

Pathobiology of chemotherapy-induced hair loss.
Hair loss can be a psychologically devastating adverse effect of chemotherapy, but satisfactory management strategies for chemotherapy-induced alopecia remain elusive. In this Review we focus on the complex pathobiology of this side-effect. We discuss the clinical features and current management approaches, then draw upon evidence from mouse models and human hair-follicle organ-culture studies to explore the main pathobiology principles and explain why chemotherapy-induced alopecia is so challenging to manage. P53-dependent apoptosis of hair-matrix keratinocytes and chemotherapy-induced hair-cycle abnormalities, driven by the dystrophic anagen or dystrophic catagen pathway, play important parts in the degree of hair-follicle damage, alopecia phenotype, and hair-regrowth pattern. Additionally, the degree of hair-follicle stem-cell damage determines whether chemotherapy-induced alopecia is reversible. We highlight the need for carefully designed preclinical research models to generate novel, clinically relevant pointers to how this condition may be overcome.

Reconstructed grounded theory: beyond comparison?
This paper examines the modifications made to constructed grounded theory for application within an ethnographic study of group work processes in a virtual learning environment. The paper details how the complex professional relationship of educational practitioner research, and the associated ethical issues, together with the variety of data analysed influenced the approach taken. The paper explores how the adaptations to constructed grounded theory process were applied and how this approach can be construed as grounded in grounded theory. <p></p> 

The paper is explicit about the application and adaptation of grounded theory to meet the needs of the research and the epistemology of the researcher.  Many studies purporting to use grounded theory are less explicit, this paper is intended to contribute to the discussion and development of a flexible approach to grounded theory, fit for purpose within the restraints of a practitioner based virtual educational ethnographic study.<p></p>  

The relationship of the practitioner researcher (an Associate Lecturer) and the participants (the students) created a dichotomy between the neutrality and social distance of the researcher and the ethical implications for the Associate Lecturer.  Whilst the participants were not vulnerable adults, many of the participants were novice learners returning to study and therefore a duty of care was required. The paper explains how the adaptation of constructed grounded theory enhanced the analysis and provided richer data than ethnographic observation alone.<p></p>

Despite the divergence from constructed grounded theory methods, rigor was achieved through the comparison of the coding produced throughout the analysis of the data.  This level of rigor led to the emergence of unanticipated themes which influenced the group work processes.  It is my belief that these would not have appeared through generic inductive approaches as they would have been overlooked and ignored without the line by line analysis.  The modification of the grounded theory process retained the influence of constructed grounded theory rather than claiming to be rooted in constructed grounded theory. But the techniques applied are not beyond comparison with grounded theory.  The research into virtual group work is timely in light of recent UK Government reports and relevant as interest in network delivered learning continues to grow.

[tumor, cancer, cell, stromal, coupling, oxidative, metabolic, autophagy]

Understanding the Warburg effect and the prognostic value of stromal caveolin-1 as a marker of a lethal tumor microenvironment.
Cancer cells show a broad spectrum of bioenergetic states, with some cells using aerobic glycolysis while others rely on oxidative phosphorylation as their main source of energy. In addition, there is mounting evidence that metabolic coupling occurs in aggressive tumors, between epithelial cancer cells and the stromal compartment, and between well-oxygenated and hypoxic compartments. We recently showed that oxidative stress in the tumor stroma, due to aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction, is important for cancer cell mutagenesis and tumor progression. More specifically , increased autophagy/mitophagy in the tumor stroma drives a form of parasitic epithelial-stromal metabolic coupling. These findings explain why it is effective to treat tumors with either inducers or inhibitors of autophagy, as both would disrupt this energetic coupling. We also discuss evidence that glutamine addiction in cancer cells produces ammonia via oxidative mitochondrial metabolism. Ammonia production in cancer cells, in turn, could then help maintain autophagy in the tumor stromal compartment. In this vicious cycle, the initial glutamine provided to cancer cells would be produced by autophagy in the tumor stroma. Thus, we believe that parasitic epithelial-stromal metabolic coupling has important implications for cancer diagnosis and therapy, for example, in designing novel metabolic imaging techniques and establishing new targeted therapies. In direct support of this notion, we identified a loss of stromal caveolin-1 as a marker of oxidative stress, hypoxia, and autophagy in the tumor microenvironment, explaining its powerful predictive value. Loss of stromal caveolin-1 in breast cancers is associated with early tumor recurrence, metastasis, and drug resistance, leading to poor clinical outcome.

Atomistic Simulations of Calcium Uranyl(VI) Carbonate Adsorption on Calcite and Stepped-Calcite Surfaces
Adsorption of actinyl ions onto mineral surfaces is one of the main mechanisms that control the migration of these ions in environmental systems. Here, we present computational classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the behavior of U(VI) in contact with different calcite surfaces. The calcium-uranyl-carbonate Ca2UO2(CO3)(3) species is shown to display both inner and outer-sphere adsorption to the flat {10 (1) over bar4} and the stepped {31 (4) over bar8} and {3 (12) over bar 16} planes of calcite. Free energy calculations, using the umbrella sampling method, are employed to simulate adsorption paths of the same uranyl species on the different calcite surfaces under aqueous condition. Outer-sphere adsorption is found to dominate over inner-sphere adsorption because of the high free energy barrier of removing a uranyl-carbonate interaction and replacing it with a new uranyl-surface interaction. An important bin monolayer between the surface and the sorbed complex. From the free complex was also found to adsorb preferentially on the acute-stepped ding mode is proposed involving a single vicinal water energy profiles of the different Calcite surfaces, the uranyl {31 (4) over bar8} face of calcite, in agreement with experiment.

[structure, plasmon, oxygen, atom, electron]

Nanoscale electron diffraction and plasmon spectroscopy of single- and few-layer boron nitride
Boron nitride (BN) sheets were exfoliated, and proof of the presence of single and double layers was obtained via electron diffraction and plasmon electron energy loss spectroscopy. A plasmon structure unique to mono- and bi-layer BN was established, and was accompanied by WIEN2K DFT calculations. The latter reproduced plasmon energies and general plasmon structure well; however, the detailed shape of the pi-plasmon of the calculated pure BN spectra shows discrepancies with the experimental data. The theoretical models were then modified to include impurity atoms. Both oxygen and carbon impurities were considered, as well as different structures, including singular oxygen atoms and oxygen next to carbon atoms. These various configurations were obtained by analyzing atomic-resolution high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) images. Using these modified models, a pi-plasmon structure close to the experimentally observed structure could be simulated.

Learning in Multiobjective Optimization (Dagstuhl Seminar 12041)
This report documents the programme and outcomes of the Dagstuhl Seminar 12041 "Learning in Multiobjective Optimization". The purpose of the seminar was to bring together researchers from the two main communities studying multiobjective optimization, Multiple Criteria Decision Making and Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization, to take part in a wide-ranging discussion of what constitutes learning in multiobjective optimization, how it can be facilitated, and how it can be measured. The outcome was a deeper, more integrated understanding of the whole problem-solving process in multiobjective optimization from the viewpoint of learning, and several concrete research projects directly addressing different aspects of learning.

[bacterial, inflammatory, innate, lung, immune, negative]

The innate immune rheostat: influence on lung inflammatory disease and secondary bacterial pneumonia.
The activity of innate immunity is not simply dictated by the presence of an antigen but also by the balance between negative regulatory and immune potentiator pathways. Even in the absence of antigen, innate immunity can 'inflame' if negative regulators are absent. This resting state is adaptable and dictated by environmental influences, host genetics and past infection history. A return to homoeostasis post inflammation may therefore not leave the tissue in an identical state to that prior to the inflammatory event. This adaptability makes us all unique and also explains the variable outcome experienced by a diverse population to the same inflammatory stimulus. Using murine models we have identified that influenza virus causes a long-term modification of the lung microenvironment by a de-sensitization to bacterial products and an increase in the myeloid negative regulator CD200R (CD200 receptor). These two events prevent subsequent inflammatory damage while the lung is healing, but also they may predispose to bacterial colonization of the lower respiratory tract should regulatory mechanisms overshoot. In the extreme, this leads to bacterial pneumonia, sepsis and death. A deeper understanding of the consequences arising from innate immune cell alteration during influenza infection and the subsequent development of bacterial complications has important implications for future drug development.

[seamount, valley, ridge, rift, off-axis, production, crust, population]

Record of seamount production and off-axis evolution in the western North Atlantic Ocean, 25°25′–27°10′N
Using multibeam bathymetry, we identified 86 axial and 1290 off-axis seamounts (near-circular volcanoes with heights ≥70 m) in an area of 75,000 km2 on the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR), 25°25′N to 27°10′N, extending ∼400 km from the inner rift valley floor to ∼29 Ma crust. Our study shows that seamounts are a common morphological feature of the North Atlantic seafloor. Seamount-producing volcanism occurs primarily on the inner rift valley floor, and few, if any, seamounts are formed on the rift valley walls or the ridge flank. The high abundance of off-axis seamounts is consistent with 1–3 km wide sections of oceanic crust being transferred intact from the axial valley to the ridge flank on crust >4 Ma. Significant changes in seamount abundances, sizes, and shapes are attributed to the effects of faulting between ∼0.6 and 2 m.y. off axis in the lower rift valley walls. Few seamounts are completely destroyed by (inward facing) faults, and population abundances are similar to those on axis. However, faulting reduces the characteristic height of the seamount population significantly. In the upper portions of the rift valley, on 2–4 Ma crust, crustal aging processes (sedimentation and mass wasting), together with additional outward facing faults, destroy and degrade a significant number of seamounts. Beyond the crest of the rift mountains (>4 Ma crust) faulting is no longer active, and changes in the off-axis seamount population reflect crustal aging processes as well as temporal changes in seamount production that occurred at the ridge axis. Estimates of population density for off-axis seamounts show a positive correlation to crustal thickness inferred from analysis of gravity data, suggesting that increased seamount production accompanies increased magma input at the ridge axis. We find no systematic variations in seamount population density along isochron within individual ridge segments. Possible explanations are that along-axis production of seamounts is uniform or that seamount production is enhanced in some regions (e.g., segment centers), but many seamounts do not meet our counting criteria because they are masked by younger volcanic eruptions and low-relief flows.Author Posting. © American Geophysical Union, 2000.

Friction Joining of Aluminium-to-Magnesium for Lightweight Automotive Applications
Friction joining techniques, such as Friction Stir Spot Welding (FSSW) and high power Ultrasonic Welding (USW), could offer a solution for joining dissimilar materials combinations, such as aluminium (Al) to magnesium (Mg), where high intermetallic reaction rates make the use of conventional joining techniques problematic. Ultrasonic welds have been produced between 1 mm gauge Al 6111-T4 and Mg AZ31-H24 sheets, and the interfacial reaction has been studied as a function of welding time. For this welding system, the mechanical properties of the joints were optimised when a double reed welding system was employed to join materials that had been prepared using 800 grit SiC paper under a clamping force of 1.9 kN, and when the materials were oriented with the rolling direction parallel to the vibration direction. Welds produced between Al and Mg achieved similar peak lap shear strengths to those produced between Mg and Mg at welding times of 0.4 s, but the failure energy of the Al-Mg welds was less than half that of the parent material. In addition, the Al-Mg welds always failed at the interface between the sheets, rather than the desirable, and more energy intensive, pullout mechanism. The inferior mechanical properties were attributed to the rapid formation of a brittle intermetallic layer that initially formed as islands of the γ-Al12Mg17 phase. These islands rapidly spread and became continuous within 0.3 s of welding time, at which point a second sublayer of the β-Al3Mg2 phase began to form on the Al side of the intermetallic reaction layer. The combined layers reached a total thickness of 20 µm within 0.9 s of welding time, with the β-Al3Mg2 sublayer becoming the thicker of the two by this point. At longer welding times, interface liquation was observed at temperatures below the recognised lowest temperature eutectic reaction in the Al-Mg binary phase diagram. This was the result of the alloying elements present in the system and there was no depression in the melting point as a result of the high strain rate associated with this process, as has been proposed elsewhere. The rate of growth of the intermetallic layer during welding was higher than in static heat treatments, which was most likely due to the deformation causing microcracking in the brittle intermetallic layer, allowing short circuit diffusion to occur, and enhancing the growth rate by a factor of approximately 2. Finally, attempts were made to limit the rate of intermetallic compound (IMC) formation by applying coatings to the Mg sheet. The effect of the coatings was to reduce the overall IMC layer thickness by 50 %.

Charge transport effects in field emission from carbon nanotube-polymer composites
<p>Electron field emission measurements have been made on multiwall arc discharge carbon nanotubes embedded in a conjugated polymer host. Electron emission at low nanotube content is observed and attributed to an enhancement of the applied electric field at the polymer/nanotube/vacuum interface where the electron supply through the film is attributed to fluctuation induced tunneling in a disordered percolation network. A high network resistance is attributed to a polymer coating surrounding each nanotube, resulting in high resistance nanotube-polymer-nanotube tunnel junctions. The potential use of carbon nanotube-polymer composites for field emission based displays is also discussed. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.</p>

New insights on the ecology of free-living heterotrophic nanoflagellates based on the use of molecular biological approaches
Nanoplanktonic protists comprise a diverse assemblage of flagellate species
responsible for various trophic processes in marine and freshwater ecosystems.
Current methods for identifying small protists do not readily permit identification and
enumeration of nanoplanktonic flagellates in cultures or field samples. The aim of this
study was to apply molecular biological techniques for identification and enumeration of
nanoflagellate taxa in water samples.
Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of small subunit
ribosomal DNA (SSU rONA) amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
differentiated pure cultures of heterotrophic nanoflagellates according to established
taxonomic classification at the generic and species level. In addition, RFLP analysis of
amplified SSU rONA permitted discrimination of polymorphic forms among species of
flagellates from the genus Paraphysomonas.
A fluorescent in situ hybridization method that uses rRNA-targeted
oligonucleotide probes for counting protists from cultures and environmental water
samples was developed. Preserved cells were intensely labeled with multiple eukaryote-specific oligonucleotide probes end-labeled with biotin and detected by
fluorescein (FITC)-avidin. This probe hybridization method gave estimates of
nanoplankton abundances that were often more representative of natural abundances than
estimates obtained by commonly employed fluorochrome stains.
The geographical distribution and seasonal abundance of the cosmopolitan
heterotrophic flagellate, Paraphysomonas imperforata was examined in coastal waters
using species-specific oligonucleotide probes. P. imperforata was found to occur at
extremely low abundances in coastal environments, constituting ≤1% of the TNAN.
However, P. imperforata often dominated the nanoplankton (up to 98% of TNAN) when
water samples were enriched with bacteria. P. imperforata appears to be an
opportunistic species capable of growing rapidly to high abundances when prey are
abundant. Water temperature, small differences in the absolute abundance of P.
imperforata, and nanoplankton grazers appeared to play a role in determining P.
imperforata dominance. Results from this study also suggest that enrichment cultivation
or perhaps incubations in general can select for nanoflagellates such as P. imperforata
that may not be representative of abundant oceanic species.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution March 199

TREM2 Variants in Alzheimer's Disease.
Background Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in TREM2, encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 protein, have previously been associated with an autosomal recessive form of early-onset dementia. Methods We used genome, exome, and Sanger sequencing to analyze the genetic variability in TREM2 in a series of 1092 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 1107 controls (the discovery set). We then performed a meta-analysis on imputed data for the TREM2 variant rs75932628 (predicted to cause a R47H substitution) from three genomewide association studies of Alzheimer's disease and tested for the association of the variant with disease. We genotyped the R47H variant in an additional 1887 cases and 4061 controls. We then assayed the expression of TREM2 across different regions of the human brain and identified genes that are differentially expressed in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and in control mice. Results We found significantly more variants in exon 2 of TREM2 in patients with Alzheimer's disease than in controls in the discovery set (P=0.02). There were 22 variant alleles in 1092 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 5 variant alleles in 1107 controls (P<0.001). The most commonly associated variant, rs75932628 (encoding R47H), showed highly significant association with Alzheimer's disease (P<0.001). Meta-analysis of rs75932628 genotypes imputed from genomewide association studies confirmed this association (P=0.002), as did direct genotyping of an additional series of 1887 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 4061 controls (P<0.001). Trem2 expression differed between control mice and a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Conclusions Heterozygous rare variants in TREM2 are associated with a significant increase in the risk of Alzheimer's disease. (Funded by Alzheimer's Research UK and others.).

[human, pkc, sebocyte, npkc, cpkc, role, biology]

Protein kinase C isoforms have differential roles in the regulation of human sebocyte biology.
Protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms have crucial roles in cutaneous signaling. Interestingly, we lack information about their involvement in human sebaceous gland biology. Therefore, in this current study, we investigated the functions of the PKC system in human immortalized SZ95 sebocytes. Using molecular biological approaches, imaging, and functional assays, we report that SZ95 sebocytes express the conventional cPKCα; the novel nPKCδ, ɛ, and η; and the atypical aPKCζ. Activation of the PKC system by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulated lipid synthesis (a hallmark of differentiation) and resulted in translocation and then downregulation of cPKCα and nPKCδ. In good accord with these findings, the effect of PMA was effectively abrogated by inhibitors and short interfering RNA-mediated "silencing" of cPKCα and nPKCδ. Of further importance, molecular or pharmacological inhibition of nPKCδ also prevented the lipogenic and apoptosis-promoting action of arachidonic acid. Finally, we also found that "knockdown" of the endogenous aPKCζ activity markedly increased basal lipid synthesis and apoptosis, suggesting its constitutive activity in suppressing these processes. Collectively, our findings strongly argue for the fact that certain PKCs have pivotal, isoform-specific, differential, and antagonistic roles in the regulation of human sebaceous gland-derived sebocyte biology.

17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 7 - An ancient 3-ketosteroid reductase of cholesterogenesis
17??-hydroxysterold dehydrogenase type 7 (17??-HSD7) is a novel estrogenic hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from mammals. We modeled the three-dimensional structure of human 17??-HSD7, analyzed the phylogeny of 17??-HSD7 homologues and determined its expression pattern by in silico Northern blotting. Predominant expression is found not only in reproductive tissues (breast, ovary, placenta) but also in liver and developing brain, principal sites of cholesterol synthesis. The substrate binding pocket is opening towards a conserved membrane-associated helix, which is indicative for a conversion of a membrane component. 17??-HSD7 shows significant homology to a yeast 3-ketosteroid reductase (ERG27) involved in ergosterol biosynthesis. Our results lead to the conclusion that 17??-HSD7 is not only involved in estradiol production but plays another (and possibly more important) role as a 3-ketosteroid reductase in cholesterogenesis. This agrees with the striking absence of 17??-HSD7 homologues in the complete genomes of Drosophila and C. elegans which are both auxotrophic for cholesterol.

Dihydrocodeine for breathlessness in "pink puffers".
Eighteen patients with severe breathlessness due to chronic airflow obstruction completed a randomised placebo controlled double blind cross over trial of the effect of dihydrocodeine 15 mg on breathlessness, disability, and exercise tolerance. There were three periods of one week each. During the first two weeks patients were instructed to take dihydrocodeine 15 mg or placebo 30 minutes before exercise as required up to three times daily. During the third week patients received either dihydrocodeine or placebo on alternate days. During the weekly dihydrocodeine period patients were more mobile (pedometer distance increased by 16.8%) and less breathless (daily visual analogue score of breathlessness reduced by 17.8%). This benefit was confirmed by treadmill testing at the end of each treatment period, when maximum distance walked was 16.5% higher and breathlessness 11.8% less after dihydrocodeine compared with placebo. Similar benefit in breathlessness occurred during alternate day treatment. No adverse effects were encountered. Dihydrocodeine 15 mg 30 minutes before exercise offers appreciable benefit to patients with severe breathlessness due to chronic airflow obstruction.

International, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase III study of motesanib plus carboplatin/paclitaxel in patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer: MONET1.
PURPOSE: We evaluated whether motesanib (a selective oral inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2, and 3; platelet-derived growth factor receptor; and Kit) combined with carboplatin/paclitaxel improved overall survival (OS) versus chemotherapy alone in patients with nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and in the subset of patients with adenocarcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stage IIIB/IV or recurrent nonsquamous NSCLC (no prior systemic therapy for advanced disease) were randomly assigned 1:1 to carboplatin (area under the curve, 6 mg/ml · min) and paclitaxel (200 mg/m(2)) intravenously for up to six 3-week cycles plus either motesanib 125 mg (arm A) or placebo (arm B) once daily orally. OS was the primary end point. Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), adverse events (AEs), and association between placental growth factor (PLGF) change and OS. RESULTS: A total of 1,090 patients with nonsquamous NSCLC were randomly assigned (arms A/B, n = 541 of 549); of those, 890 had adenocarcinoma (n = 448 of 442). Median OS in arms A and B was 13.0 and 11.0 months, respectively (hazard ratio HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.04; P = .14); median OS for the adenocarcinoma subset was 13.5 and 11.0 months, respectively (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.03; P = .11). In descriptive analyses (arms A v B), median PFS was 5.6 months versus 5.4 months (P = < .001); ORR was 40% versus 26% (P < .001). There was no association between PLGF change and OS in arm A. The incidence of grade ≥ 3 AEs (arms A and B, 73% and 59%, respectively) and grade 5 AEs (14% and 9%, respectively) was higher with motesanib treatment. CONCLUSION: Motesanib plus carboplatin/paclitaxel did not significantly improve OS over carboplatin/paclitaxel alone in patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC or in the adenocarcinoma subset.

Optimization of supervised cluster analysis for extracting reference tissue input curves in (R)-11CPK11195 brain PET studies.
Performance of two supervised cluster analysis (SVCA) algorithms for extracting reference tissue curves was evaluated to improve quantification of dynamic (R)-11CPK11195 brain positron emission tomography (PET) studies. Reference tissues were extracted from images using both a manually defined cerebellum and SVCA algorithms based on either four (SVCA4) or six (SVCA6) kinetic classes. Data from controls, mild cognitive impairment patients, and patients with Alzheimer's disease were analyzed using various kinetic models including plasma input, the simplified reference tissue model (RPM) and RPM with vascular correction (RPMVb). In all subject groups, SVCA-based reference tissue curves showed lower blood volume fractions (Vb) and volume of distributions than those based on cerebellum time-activity curve. Probably resulting from the presence of specific signal from the vessel walls that contains in normal condition a significant concentration of the 18 kDa translocation protein. Best contrast between subject groups was seen using SVCA4-based reference tissues as the result of a lower number of kinetic classes and the prior removal of extracerebral tissues. In addition, incorporation of Vb in RPM improved both parametric images and binding potential contrast between groups. Incorporation of Vb within RPM, together with SVCA4, appears to be the method of choice for analyzing cerebral (R)-11CPK11195 neurodegeneration studies.

G6PC3 mutations cause non-syndromic severe congenital neutropenia.
The deficiency of ubiquitously expressed glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC3) enzyme is known to result in a syndrome characterized by severe congenital neutropenia, prominent superficial venous pattern, congenital heart defects and genito-urinary malformations. Here, we describe four patients from three families with non-syndromic severe congenital neutropenia and identify four G6PC3 mutations as causative in these cases. Thus we demonstrate that G6PC3 mutations also result in a non-syndromic form of severe congenital neutropenia. We propose that G6PC3 deficiency should be considered as part of the differential diagnoses in any patient with unexplained congenital neutropenia. Additionally, we show a relationship between the genotype and non-hematological phenotype of G6PC3 deficiency. These findings may provide an insight into the role of the G6PC3 enzyme and glucose metabolism in developmental pathways.

A Study of Beam Position Diagnostics with Beam-excited Dipole Higher Order Modes using a Downconverter Test Electronics in Third Harmonic 3.9 GHz Superconducting Accelerating Cavities at FLASH
Beam-excited higher order modes (HOM) in accelerating cavities contain transverse beam position information. Previous studies have narrowed down three modal options for beam position diagnostics in the third harmonic 3.9 GHz cavities at FLASH. Localized modes in the beam pipes at approximately 4.1 GHz and in the fifth cavity dipole band at approximately 9 GHz were found, that can provide a local measurement of the beam position. In contrast, propagating modes in the first and second dipole bands between 4.2 and 5.5 GHz can reach a better resolution. All the options were assessed with a specially designed test electronics built by Fermilab. The aim is to define a mode or spectral region suitable for the HOM electronics. Two data analysis techniques are used and compared in extracting beam position information from the dipole HOMs: direct linear regression and singular value decomposition. Current experiments suggest a resolution of 50 micron accuracy in predicting local beam position using modes in the fifth dipole band, and a global resolution of 20 micron over the complete module. Based on these results we decided to build a HOM electronics for the second dipole band and the fifth dipole band, so that we will have both high resolution measurements for the whole module, and localized measurements for individual cavity. The prototype electronics is being built by Fermilab and planned to be tested in FLASH by the end of 2012.

High-K Structures Under Extreme Conditions
<p>High-K isomer decay rates are compared and interpreted, with an emphasis on the spin degree of freedom. It is argued that high-K values do not in themselves lead to K mixing. Rather, evidence is presented that the most important consideration is the isomer energy relative to a rotor whose moment of inertia is approximately 85\% of the rigid-body value. The high-spin limit to the occurrence of high-K isomers is then discussed in connection with predictions of competing oblate rotation-aligned structures. Finally, some observations are made regarding the use of K isomers as a tool to access exotic nuclei, including superheavy elements, and exotic nuclear structures.</p>

Interpretation of Enhancement Factor in Nonplanar Field Emitters
<p>A comparison of the field emission properties of exposed nanotubes lying on a tipped carbon nanorope, with the emission properties from a sharpened iron tip of similar dimensions is performed. By varying the electrode separation it is observed that the threshold field for emission for both structures decreases as the electrode separation initially increases; however, for sufficiently large electrode separations, the threshold field is observed to reach an asymptotic value. Our results show that the field enhancement factor is fundamentally associated with the electrode separation, and depending on the experimental conditions in order to obtain a true value for electric field a set of alternative definitions for enhancement factors is required. We further confirm our experimental synopsis by simulation of the local electrostatic field which gives results similar to those obtained experimentally.</p>

[qol, spiritual, srpb, health, religious, domain]

Spiritual, religious, and personal beliefs are important and distinctive to assessing quality of life in health: a comparison of theoretical models.
OBJECTIVES: The study investigates theoretical debates on the contribution of spiritual, religious, and personal beliefs (SRPB) to quality of life (QoL) in health, by examining contrasting models. DESIGN AND METHOD: The WHOQOL-SRPB assesses QoL relating to SRPB where 33 QoL facets are scored in 6 domains, of which SRPB is one. The measure was completed by a heterogeneous sample of 285 sick and well people representing a cross-section of religious, agnostic, and atheist beliefs in UK, and structured for gender (52% female) and age (mean 47 years). RESULTS: No evidence was found to support the model of spiritual QoL as a concept that overarches every other QoL domain. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that SRPB is an integral concept to overall QoL, with a very good fit (comparative fit index=.99). Spiritual QoL made a significant, relatively independent contribution, similar to the other five domains (β=0.68). Spiritual QoL is most closely associated with the psychological domain, particularly hope and optimism and inner peace; two of the nine SRPB facets. Spiritual QoL, but not most other aspects of QoL, is higher for religious people. CONCLUSION: The results explain theoretical confusion arising from previous research. Spiritual QoL makes a significant and distinctive contribution to QoL assessment in health and should be assessed routinely in health care populations.

Is early Class III protraction facemask treatment effective? A multicentre, randomized, controlled trial: 3-year follow-up.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of early class III protraction facemask treatment in children under 10 years of age at 3-year follow-up. Design: Multicentre randomized controlled trial. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seventy-three patients were randomly allocated, stratified for gender, into early class III protraction facemask group (PFG) (n = 35) and a control/no treatment group (CG) (n = 38). OUTCOMES: Dentofacial changes were assessed from lateral cephalograms and occlusal changes using the peer assessment rating (PAR). Self-esteem was assessed using the Piers-Harris children's self-concept scale, and the psychosocial impact of malocclusion with oral aesthetic subjective impact score (OASIS) questionnaire. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) signs and symptoms were also recorded. The time points for data collection were at registration (DC1), 15 months later (DC2) and 3 years post-registration (DC3). RESULTS: The following mean skeletal and occlusal changes occurred from the class III starting point to DC3 (3-year follow-up): SNA, PFG moved forwards +2·3° (CG forward +1·6°; P = 0·14); SNB, PFG moved forwards +0·8° (CG forward +1·5°, P = 0·26); ANB, PFG class III base improved +1·5° (CG stayed about the same at +0·1°; P = 0·001). This contributed to an overall difference in ANB between PFG and CG of +1·4° in favour of early protraction facemask treatment. The overjet was still improved by +3·6 mm in the PFG and changed a small amount +1·1 mm in the CG (P = 0·001). A 21% improvement in PAR was shown in the PFG and the CG worsened by 8·4% (P = 0·02). There was no increase in self-esteem (Piers-Harris score) for PFG compared with the CG (P = 0·56) and no statistically significant difference in the impact of malocclusion (OASIS) between groups in terms of the changes from DC1 to DC3 (P = 0·18). TMJ signs and symptoms were very low at DC1 and DC3. CONCLUSIONS: The favourable effect of early class III protraction facemask treatment undertaken in patients under 10 years of age, is maintained at 3-year follow-up in terms of ANB, overjet and % PAR improvement. The direct protraction treatment effect at SNA is still favourable although not statistically significantly better than the CG. Seventy per cent of patients in PFG had maintained a positive overjet which we have defined as ongoing treatment success. Early protraction facemask treatment does not seem to influence self-esteem or reduce the patient's personal impact of their malocclusion at 3-year follow-up.

[qol, depression, group, treatment, isotretinoin, acne]

A prospective trial of the effects of isotretinoin on quality of life and depressive symptoms.
BACKGROUND: Isotretinoin is an efficacious treatment for acne, but has been controversially linked with depression. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine the effects of isotretinoin on quality of life(QoL) and depression using a prospective design. METHODS: The WHOQOL-BREF QoL measure and Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale were administered to consecutive outpatients with acne who were prescribed either isotretinoin (n = 65) or antibiotic treatment (n = 31).Patients and physicians rated acne severity independently. Groups were compared at baseline with a matched community sample (n = 94) and measurements repeated at 3 months for treatment groups. RESULTS: There were no differences between the three groups at baseline in terms of age, gender, depression or overall QoL. Acne was more severe in the treatment groups (P < 0·001). Depression was negatively correlated with QoL (P < 0·001)and hence was included as a covariate in repeated-measures analyses of QoL.Acne improved over time in both treatment groups (F = 48·2, P < 0·001). There was no detectable deterioration in depression score in either group (F = 1·1, not significant). QoL in the physical and social domains improved (P < 0·001) while psychological and environmental QoL was unchanged over time. The improvement in social QoL was greater in the isotretinoin group (P < 0·05). Those patients with higher baseline depression scores showed greater improvements in physical, psychological and social QoL (P < 0·001). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of acne improves QoL, particularly in those with more depressive symptoms at the outset. Mood deterioration was not detected, but the possibility of subtle or rare mood effects of isotretinoin cannot be ruled out.

Comparison of out of hours care provided by patients' own general practitioners and commercial deputising services: a randomised controlled trial. I: The process of care.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the process of out of hours care provided by general practitioners from patients' own practices and by commercial deputising services. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Four urban areas in Manchester, Salford, Stockport, and Leicester. SUBJECTS: 2152 patients who requested out of hours care, and 49 practice doctors and 183 deputising doctors (61% local principals) who responded to those requests. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Response to call, time to visit, prescribing, and hospital admissions. RESULTS: 1046 calls were dealt with by practice doctors and 1106 by deputising doctors. Practice doctors were more likely to give telephone advice (20.2% v 0.72% of calls) and to visit more quickly than deputising doctors (median delay 35 minutes v 52 minutes). Practice doctors were less likely than deputising doctors to issue a prescription (56.1% v 63.2% of patients) or to prescribe an antibiotic (43.7% v 61.3% of prescriptions issued) and more likely to prescribe genetic drugs (58.4% v 32.1% of drugs prescribed), cheaper drugs (mean cost per prescription pounds 3.28 v pounds 5.04), and drugs in a predefined out of hours formulary (49.8% v 41.1% of drugs prescribed). There was no significant difference in the number of hospital admissions. CONCLUSIONS: By contrast with practice doctors, deputising doctors providing out of hours care less readily give telephone advice, take longer to visit at home, and have patterns of prescribing that may be less discriminating.

Amiodarone overdose and its management.
A patient taking an overdose of 3.4 g of amiodarone is described. Consciousness and physical examination remained normal throughout. Continuous electrocardiographic monitoring for 48 hours after admission revealed only a self-limiting episode of ventricular tachycardia, despite high serum levels of the drug (serum desethylamiodarone levels 4.4 mg/l). The pharmacokinetic properties of amiodarone and treatment strategies for the overdose situation are discussed. It is suggested that there may be a role for the use of cholestyramine in the treatment of both acute and chronic amiodarone toxicity.

[alphav, osteoclast, odn, antisense, apoptosis, gene, bone, integrin]

Oligodeoxynucleotide targeted to the alphav gene inhibits alphav integrin synthesis, impairs osteoclast function, and activates intracellular signals to apoptosis.
The alphav integrin subunit is highly expressed in osteoclasts where it dimerizes with beta1 and beta3 subunits to form receptors for vitronectin and bone sialoproteins. Inhibition of osteoclast adhesion and function has previously been achieved by alphavbeta3 antibodies or Arg-Gly-Asp-containing peptides which have the disadvantages of blocking a single receptor type, or of being rather nonspecific, respectively. Here we show that alphav integrin expression in rabbit osteoclasts can be inhibited by partially phosphorothioated antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) spanning the adenine-uracil-guanine (AUG) translational start site of the human/rabbit alphav gene, a procedure which offers the advantage of affecting all the alphav receptors with high efficiency. The alphav antisense ODN caused a dose-dependent, substrate-specific reduction of osteoclast adhesion and bone resorption. Control ODNs, such as sense, inverted, and mismatch, were without effect, providing evidence of specificity of the antisense reagent. It is likely as a consequence of loss of substrate interaction, the antisense ODN induced osteoclast retraction and apoptosis, increase of the cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complex inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1, and inhibition of the cell survival gene, bcl-2. Although the expression of the cell death-promoting gene, bax, remained unchanged, a reduction of the bcl-2/bax ratio, known to underlie the intracellular signal to apoptosis, was observed. This finding led us to hypothesize that these changes could provide a link between reduction of alphav synthesis and osteoclast programmed death. In conclusion, this study provides novel insights into the use of alphav antisense ODN as an efficacious mechanism for blocking osteoclast function and underscores for the first time the involvement of integrins in bone cell apoptosis. In vivo studies may verify potential application of this ODN as alternative therapy for bone diseases.

[neurodevelopmental, brain, process, evidence, illness, transition, early, structural, factor, imaging]

Structural brain imaging evidence for multiple pathological processes at different stages of brain development in schizophrenia.
The underlying neurobiology of emerging psychotic disorders is not well understood. While there is evidence from structural imaging and other studies supporting the popular notion that schizophrenia arises as a consequence of an "early neurodevelopmental" lesion, more recent findings challenge this notion. Evidence, including our own data, suggests that dynamic brain changes occur during the earliest stages of a psychotic illness, including around the time of transition to illness. In this article we review the available longitudinal and relevant cross-sectional structural neuroimaging studies focusing on both the very early neurodevelopmental markers (pre- or perinatal origin) and the later markers (late neurodevelopmental) around the period of transition to illness. Based on our review of recent findings, we suggest that the onset of psychosis is a time of active brain changes, wherein, for a proportion of individuals, (i) an early (pre- and perinatal) neurodevelopmental lesion renders the brain vulnerable to anomalous late (particularly postpubertal) neurodevelopmental processes, as indicated by evidence for accelerated loss of gray matter and aberrant connectivity particularly in prefrontal regions; and (ii) these anomalous neurodevelopmental processes interact with other causative factors associated with the onset of psychosis (e.g., substance use, stress, and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function), which together have neuroprogressive sequelae involving medial temporal and orbital prefrontal regions, as suggested by imaging studies around transition to active illness. However, the pathological processes underlying such progressive changes during "late neurodevelopment" remain unclear but may reflect anomalies of synaptic plasticity, abnormal brain maturation, the adverse effects of stress, or other environmental factors. In this context, the features of schizophrenia, including the neuropsychological deficits and behavioral manifestations, can be understood as direct effects of these multiple pathological processes at various neurodevelopmental stages, including genetic and nongenetic etiological factors.

Carrier transport and recombination in p-doped and intrinsic 1.3 mu m InAs/GaAs quantum-dot lasers
<p>The radiative and nonradiative components of the threshold current in 1.3 mu m, p-doped and undoped quantum-dot semiconductor lasers were studied between 20 and 370 K. The complex behavior can be explained by simply assuming that the radiative recombination and nonradiative Auger recombination rates are strongly modified by thermal redistribution of carriers between the dots. The large differences between the devices arise due to the trapped holes in the p-doped devices. These both greatly increase Auger recombination involving hole excitation at low temperatures and decrease electron thermal escape due to their Coulombic attraction. The model explains the high T-0 values observed near room temperature. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.</p>

Non-cardiac chest pain: a retrospective cohort study of patients who attended a Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinic.
BACKGROUND: Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinics have recently been introduced to assist in the management of primary care patients experiencing suspected cardiac chest pain. OBJECTIVE: To study the longer term outcome for patients referred to a Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinic and then given a non-cardiac diagnosis. METHODS: The study collected retrospective data from a cohort of all patients attending the Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinic based in the cardiorespiratory Department at the York District Hospital, England. Questionnaires were sent to all patients who attended the Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinic during the previous 14 months and were diagnosed with non-cardiac chest pain. Participants reported on their chest pain, subsequent episodes of primary and secondary care and their beliefs about causation of pain. RESULTS: Of the patients referred to the Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinic, 235 (52%) did not have cardiac chest pain. Of these patients, 161 (69%) returned the questionnaire, nearly half of whom reported ongoing chest pain. The mean time since Clinic attendance was approximately 8 months and the median duration of ongoing chest pain was 5.4 months. Women were twice as likely as men to continue to be experiencing pain but did not report more frequent or severe pain on average. More than 50% of the non-cardiac group were not convinced by their negative cardiac diagnosis. CONCLUSION: There is an ongoing challenge to support patients with non-cardiac chest pain, including the provision of reassurance that their pain is very unlikely to be caused by their heart.

A MULTIFACETED EXPLORATION OF PLANETARY NEBULAE
ABSTRACT OF THESIS submitted by Lizette Guzman-Ramirez for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy and entitled “A Multifaceted Exploration of Planetary Nebulae”, November 2012.This thesis analyses and proposes solutions for the following PNe mysteries:1. The missing PNe population. 100 new objects were spectroscopically observed and analysed using the INT Photometric Halpha Survey (IPHAS). 32 are PNe, 13 are possible PNe and the rest are HII regions, SNR and unclear objects. The new PNe were within the inner parts of the galactic plane. The IPHAS survey has been the deepest survey done in Halpha, and revealed objects never seen before.2. The mixed chemistry in Galactic Bulge PNe. These GBPNe are the end-products of low-mass stars (and therefore expected to be O-rich) and belong to a metal rich population. These PNe present dual-dust chemistry, with the presence of PAHs (carbon-rich) and crystalline silicates (oxygen-rich) in their spectra. This thesis analysed 40 Galactic Bulge PNe and found a strong correlation between intensity of the PAH bands and morphology, notably a massive torus. This torus provides the dense irradiated environment needed to form the PAHs. Follow-up observations using VISIR revealed a dense dusty tori in 11 PNe. PAHs are present in the outer edges of these tori, whereas ionised material is located within the dusty tori.3. The 3He problem. Using the VLA we observed three PNe, upper-limits of their 3He abundances were estimated. The resulting evolution of 3He is only consistent with the values determined in pre-solar material and the ISM, if the PNe observed represent only 4% of the population of low-mass stars, and the remaining 96% have undergone enhanced 3He depletion.

Dissipative quantum dynamics in low-energy collisions of complex nuclei
<p>Model calculations that include the effects of irreversible, environmental couplings on top of a coupled-channels dynamical description of the collision of two complex nuclei are presented. The Liouville-von Neumann equation for the time evolution of the density matrix of a dissipative system is solved numerically providing a consistent transition from coherent to decoherent (and dissipative) dynamics during the collision. Quantum decoherence and dissipation are clearly manifested in the model calculations. Energy dissipation, due to the irreversible decay of giant-dipole vibrational states of the colliding nuclei, is shown to result in a hindrance of quantum tunneling and fusion.</p>

3-D Topologies for Networks-on-Chip
everal interesting topologies emerge by incorporating the third dimension in networks-on-chip (NoC). The speed and power consumption of 3D NoC are compared to that of 2D NoC. Physical constraints, such as the maximum number of planes that can be vertically stacked and the asymmetry between the horizontal and vertical communication channels of the network, are included in speed and power consumption models of these novel 3D structures. An analytic model for the zero-load latency of each network that considers the effects of the topology on the performance of a 3D NoC is developed. Tradeoffs between the number of nodes utilized in the third dimension, which reduces the average number of hops traversed by a packet, and the number of physical planes used to integrate the functional blocks of the network, which decreases the length of the communication channel, is evaluated for both the latency and power consumption of a network. A performance improvement of 40% and 36% and a decrease of 62% and 58% in power consumption is demonstrated for 3D NoC as compared to a traditional 2D NoC topology for a network size of N = 128 and N = 256 nodes, respectively.

Computational Proteomics for Genome Annotation
The field of proteogenomics operates at the interface between proteomics and genomics, and has emerged during the past decade to exploit the vast quantities of high-throughput sequence data. A range of different proteogenomics approaches have been developed, which integrate mass spectrometry data with genome sequence data to provide empirical evidence for protein-coding genes. However, current methods may not be optimized as they do not fully consider the splicing complexity in eukaryotes and there is currently no best practice method. To address this, we investigate the level of proteomics support for Ensembl gene models in human, and a selection of model organisms. We find a disparity between the number of splice variants confirmed by extant data, and the number that can theoretically be confirmed using current proteomics technologies. We then go on to investigate EST-based proteogenomics methods, which enabled the discovery of novel peptide sequences in the chicken genome, which represent hitherto unannotated genes, amended gene models, polymorphisms, and genes missing from the genome assembly. Different approaches for searching mass spectrometry data against transcript sequences are explored, and we show that searching mass spectra against protein sequences predicted by the EORF and ESTScan2 translation tools results in the best sensitivity.

Yeşilçam Film Posters of the 60s and 70s:  Representing Romance
<p>Cinema and movie poster have the most powerful potential of establishing the ethos and mythology of people, and both assume an audience on the premises of a cultural context within which they are produced. So a movie poster contributing to mass communication through designed visual means contains a lot of information about film industry, evolution of design, craftsmanship, and the taste of the artists and society as well as standing for a strong evidence of its time. </p>
<p>
The decade 1965-1975 is important for Turkish cinema for being the golden years of this industry. Besides all the good memories associated with these posters, they indeed involve the history of Turkish cinema, graphic design as well as Turkish society. The great deal of labour involved, resulting from the poor resources of the period; design elements, typography, composition, the mistakes; all reflect the characteristics of then-Yeşilçam. Going over an archive of posters and with the help of interviews with designers, cinema historians and labourers, the article focuses on the relationship of design with the industry, technology and society.</p>
<p>
The Yeşilçam movie posters are analyzed through the methods of iconography as well as reception theory. And therefore as well as exploring their graphic and visual characteristics they would be placed in the context of the social life, the conditions of the movie industry in Turkey, the character of Yeşilçam Melodrama and evolution of Turkish movie poster. </p>
<p>
After a detailed research and observation, four categories are revealed as the most frequently seen types among the Turkish melodrama posters, according to the kind of images in relation to specific themes and concepts and the design schemas they use. These are “star posters”, “beefcake posters”, “phallic woman posters”, and “posters of movement”. The paper goes in detail how these categories are formed and their significance and their relation to the creation of the concept of romance.

Outcomes in elderly Danish citizens admitted with community-acquired pneumonia. Regional differencties, in a public healthcare system.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate regional differences in and risk factors for admission, length of stay, mortality, and readmission for community-acquired pneumonia in elderly Danish patients. METHODS: National registry study on elderly Danish citizens with an acute admission in 2009 owing to community-acquired pneumonia. We studied differences among hospitals in length of stay, in-hospital mortality, mortality within 30 days of discharge, and readmission within 30 days after discharge using Cox regression models with adjustments for age, sex, ventilatory support, and co-morbidity by Charlson's index score. RESULTS: A total of 11,332 elderly citizens were admitted with community-acquired pneumonia. Mortality during admission and 30-days from discharge were 11.6% and 16.2%, respectively. Readmission rates within 30 days of discharge were 12.3%. There were significantly differences between hospitals in length of stay. A high Charlson index score and advanced age were significantly risk factors for death during admission and within 30 days of discharge. Male sex and high Charlson index score were significant risk factors for readmission. Admission to large bed capacity hospital was a significant risk factor for death and readmission within 30 days of discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Length of stay, rate of admission, mortality and readmission in elderly Danish patients with community-acquired pneumonia follows international findings. There are regional differences between hospitals. In depth investigation in regional differences could reveal potential feasible clinical interventions with an improvement of readmission-, mortality rates and cost.

Its association with intra abdominal desmoplastic small round cell tumour is extremely rare. We describe a rare case of sister Mary Joseph's nodule associated with desmoplastic small round cell tumour. We conclude that differential diagnosis of Sister Mary Joseph's nodule should include desmoplastic small round cell tumour, especially in adolescents and young adults.

[papillomavirus, human]

Human papillomavirus and cervical cancer.
Cervical cancer is caused by human papillomavirus infection. Most human papillomavirus infection is harmless and clears spontaneously but persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (especially type 16) can cause cancer of the cervix, vulva, vagina, anus, penis, and oropharynx. The virus exclusively infects epithelium and produces new viral particles only in fully mature epithelial cells. Human papillomavirus disrupts normal cell-cycle control, promoting uncontrolled cell division and the accumulation of genetic damage. Two effective prophylactic vaccines composed of human papillomavirus type 16 and 18, and human papillomavirus type 16, 18, 6, and 11 virus-like particles have been introduced in many developed countries as a primary prevention strategy. Human papillomavirus testing is clinically valuable for secondary prevention in triaging low-grade cytology and as a test of cure after treatment. More sensitive than cytology, primary screening by human papillomavirus testing could enable screening intervals to be extended. If these prevention strategies can be implemented in developing countries, many thousands of lives could be saved.

Disappearance of the N=14 shell gap in the carbon isotopic chain
<p>The structure of C-17-20(6) nuclei was investigated by means of the in-beam gamma-ray spectroscopy technique using fragmentation reactions of radioactive beams. Based on particle-gamma and particle-gamma gamma coincidence data, level schemes are constructed for the neutron-rich C17-20 nuclei. The systematics of the first excited 2(+) states in the carbon isotopes is extended for the first time to A = 20 showing that in contrast to the case of the oxygen isotopes, the N = 14 subshell closure disappears. Experimental results are compared with shell-model calculations. Agreement between them is found only if a reduced neutron-neutron effective interaction is used. Implications of this reduced interaction in some properties of weakly bound neutron-rich Carbon are discussed.</p>

Apoptosis, intrinsic radiosensitivity and prediction of radiotherapy response in cervical carcinoma
Apoptosis is an important mechanism of cell death in tumours and it is seen both prior to and following radiotherapy. In this study patients with proven carcinoma of the cervix had measurement made of the percentage of apoptotic cells (apoptotic index or AI) in pre-therapy biopsies. Measurements of intrinsic radiosensitivity (SF2), already shown to be a predictor of outcome, had previously been made on the same pre-therapy biopsies. Mitotic index (MI) and Ki-67 antigen staining were also recorded as markers for proliferation. Patients were divided into those with an AI above or below the median and in general increasing apoptosis was associated with poor prognosis. The 5-year survival rate for tumours with an AI below the median was 79% and was significantly greater than the rate of 47% for those with an AI above the median (p = 0.003). There was also a significantly increased 5-year local recurrence-free rate for patients with an AI below the median compared with those with an AI above the median (79 versus 61%, p = 0.012). In addition, AI and SF2 acted as independent prognostic indicators. Patients with both an SF2 and AI value above the median did badly (25% 5-year survival, 46% local control) compared with those with an SF2 and AI below the median (80% 5-year survival, 100% local control). Apoptosis showed correlation with MI (n = 66, r = 0.34, p = 0.002) and cell staining for the Ki-67 antigen (n = 57, r = 0.25, p = 0.03), but neither MI nor Ki-67 were related to patient outcome. This suggests that while apoptosis may be a reflection of tumour proliferation this cannot in itself explain the ability of apoptosis to predict clinical outcome for this series of patients. The study raises the possibility of AI and SF2 being used together as predictors of tumour response to radiotherapy.

Adult Attachment and Psychotherapy
This thesis explores the association between adult attachment and psychological therapy by examining attachment as an outcome variable of therapy, as well as a predictor of therapy outcome. The literature review systematically explores research that has examined changes in attachment representations during psychological therapy. The purpose of the review is to enhance understanding of change processes in adult attachment and to provide empirical support to the premises of attachment theory. In spite of inconsistencies with regards to measurement and conceptualisation of attachment, the evidence suggests that attachment security increases during therapy, whereas insecurity decreases.The aim of the empirical paper was to examine the association between global adult attachment representations, specific attachment to the therapist, working alliance and response to individual Cognitive-Behaviour Therapy (CBT). The study also investigated changes in global attachment representations and their relationship with outcome. The results indicated that clients with greater secure attachment to the therapist showed greater improvements in symptoms, whereas clients with higher avoidant-fearful attachment to the therapist demonstrated less improvement. Significant improvements in attachment avoidance and anxiety were also associated with improvements in psychological symptoms, as was working alliance. No associations between adult global attachment and outcome were found. In paper 3, the approaches used within the current thesis are evaluated in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. Clinical implications of the findings are discussed and ideas for future research are outlined.

Direct Determination of Ultrafast Intersubband Hole Relaxation Times in Voltage Biased SiGe Quantum Wells by a Density Matrix Interpretation of Femtosecond Resolved Photocurrent Experiments
<p>We report the quantitative and direct determination of hole intersubband relaxation times in a voltage biased SiGe heterostructure using density matrix calculations applied to a four-level system in order to interpret photocurrent (PC) pump-pump experiments. One consistent set of parameters allows the simulation of two kinds of experiments, namely pump-pump photocurrent experiments at a free electron laser (wavelength 7.9 mu m) and the laser-power dependence of the PC signal. This strongly confirms the high reliability of these parameter values, of which the most interesting in respect to Si based quantum cascade laser development is the extracted heavy-hole relaxation time. The simulations show that this relaxation time directly determines the experimentally observed decay of the pump-pump photocurrent signal as a function of the delay time. For a heavy hole intersubband spacing of 160 meV, a value of 550 fs was obtained. The experimental method was further applied to determine the LH1-HH1 relaxation time of a second sample with a transition energy below the optical phonon energy. The observed relaxation time of 16 ps is consistent with the value found for the same structure by transmission pump-probe experiments.</p>

[apoptosis, mouse, skin, role]

Role of Fas/Fas ligand-mediated apoptosis in murine contact hypersensitivity.
Apoptosis plays an important role in immune responses, but little is known about its involvement in contact hypersensitivity (CH). In this study, we have investigated the role of Fas/Fas ligand (FasL)-mediated apoptosis in the pathogenesis of CH. Mice were sensitized by one topical application of 100 microl of 3% oxazolone to shaved skin of the abdomen. Six days later, CH was provoked by challenging both sides of sensitized mouse right ear with 15 microl of 1% oxazolone. Using a DNA ladder assay, we found that apoptosis was induced in the skin of oxazolone-sensitized mice 24-96 h after allergen challenge. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis flow cytometric assay showed that early apoptotic CD4(+) T cells (annexin V-FITC(+)PI(-)), but not late apoptotic CD4(+) T cells (annexin V-FITC(+)PI(+)), increased in the inflamed skin of mice with CH. Moreover, the expressions of mRNAs for T helper (Th2) cytokine (interleukin (IL)-4), Th1 cytokine (interferon (IFN)-gamma) and proapoptotic molecules (Bax, Fas, FasL and IL-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE)/caspase-1) were significantly elevated in the oxazolone-sensitized mouse skin 6-72 h after allergen challenge. Dramatic increase in IL-10 mRNA was only observed in the sensitized mouse skin 6 and 12 h after allergen challenge. Furthermore, CH was significantly inhibited with decreased apoptosis and early apoptotic CD4(+) T cells in inflamed skin in Fas mutant lpr/lpr mice compared to wild-type mice, whereas there were no significant differences in IL-4, IFN-gamma, IL-10, Bax and ICE mRNAs in the inflamed skin of CH between lpr/lpr and wild-type mice. Our results thus suggest that Fas/FasL pathway partially contributes to apoptosis in murine CH and that Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis plays a partial role in the development of CH. The contribution of Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis to CH appears independent of Th1 and Th2 cytokines.

[treatment, psoriasis, severe, pasi, goal, moderate, phase, plaque, patient, consensus]

Definition of treatment goals for moderate to severe psoriasis: a European consensus.
Patients with moderate to severe psoriasis are undertreated. To solve this persistent problem, the consensus programme was performed to define goals for treatment of plaque psoriasis with systemic therapy and to improve patient care. An expert consensus meeting and a collaborative Delphi procedure were carried out. Nineteen dermatologists from different European countries met for a face-to-face discussion and defined items through a four-round Delphi process. Severity of plaque psoriasis was graded into mild and moderate to severe disease. Mild disease was defined as body surface area (BSA) ≤10 and psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) ≤10 and dermatology life quality index (DLQI) ≤10 and moderate to severe psoriasis as (BSA > 10 or PASI > 10) and DLQI > 10. Special clinical situations may change mild psoriasis to moderate to severe including involvement of visible areas or severe nail involvement. For systemic therapy of plaque psoriasis two treatment phases were defined: (1) induction phase as the treatment period until week 16; however, depending on the type of drug and dose regimen used, this phase may be extended until week 24 and (2) maintenance phase for all drugs was defined as the treatment period after the induction phase. For the definition of treatment goals in plaque psoriasis, the change of PASI from baseline until the time of evaluation (ΔPASI) and the absolute DLQI were used. After induction and during maintenance therapy, treatment can be continued if reduction in PASI is ≥75%. The treatment regimen should be modified if improvement of PASI is <50%. In a situation where the therapeutic response improved ≥50% but <75%, as assessed by PASI, therapy should be modified if the DLQI is >5 but can be continued if the DLQI is ≤5. This programme defines the severity of plaque psoriasis for the first time using a formal consensus of 19 European experts. In addition, treatment goals for moderate to severe disease were established. Implementation of treatment goals in the daily management of psoriasis will improve patient care and mitigate the problem of undertreatment. It is planned to evaluate the implementation of these treatment goals in a subsequent programme involving patients and physicians.

Comparative study of three PCR assays with antigenaemia and serology for the diagnosis of HCMV infection in thoracic transplant recipients.
Three PCR assays were evaluated for the detection of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection in heart and lung transplant recipients in comparison with HCMV antigenaemia and serology assay. Polymorphonuclear leucocyte (PMNL) samples taken at regular intervals after transplantation were tested for HCMV DNA using primer sets homologous to the glycoprotein B (gp58), major immediate early (IE1), and structural phosphoprotein (pp150) regions. The detection of HCMV infection at various times after transplantation showed all three primer sets to have a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 92.3% for the detection of HCMV infection although overall the gp58 primer set was found to be significantly more frequently associated with a positive PCR result than the IE1 (P = 0.0228) and pp150 (P = 0.0015) primer sets. The positive PCR result had a positive predictive value of 27.8% for HCMV disease. Detection of HCMV infection was first by the PCR assay, and significantly before the HCMV antigenaemia assay. Of nine patients who received antiviral therapy while PCR positive, only one patient cleared HCMV DNA from PMNLs during treatment but became positive again 17 days later. Quantitative PCR methodologies may improve the predictive value of PCR for HCMV disease and its value for monitoring antiviral therapy.

Mass fractionation of noble gases in synthetic methane hydrate : implications for naturally occurring gas hydrate dissociation
As a consequence of contemporary or longer term (since 15 ka) climate warming, gas hydrates in some settings may presently be dissociating and releasing methane and other gases to the ocean–atmosphere system. A key challenge in assessing the impact of dissociating gas hydrates on global atmospheric methane is the lack of a technique able to distinguish between methane recently released from gas hydrates and methane emitted from leaky thermogenic reservoirs, shallow sediments (some newly thawed), coal beds, and other sources. Carbon and deuterium stable isotopic fractionation during methane formation provides a first-order constraint on the processes (microbial or thermogenic) of methane generation. However, because gas hydrate formation and dissociation do not cause significant isotopic fractionation, a stable isotope-based hydrate-source determination is not possible. Here, we investigate patterns of mass-dependent noble gas fractionation within the gas hydrate lattice to fingerprint methane released from gas hydrates. Starting with synthetic gas hydrate formed under laboratory conditions, we document complex noble gas fractionation patterns in the gases liberated during dissociation and explore the effects of aging and storage (e.g., in liquid nitrogen), as well as sampling and preservation procedures. The laboratory results confirm a unique noble gas fractionation pattern for gas hydrates, one that shows promise in evaluating modern natural gas seeps for a signature associated with gas hydrate dissociation.This paper is not subject to U.S. copyright.

ViCRAM: Visual Complexity Rankings and Accessibility Metrics (ViCRAM Technical Report)
The World Wide Web (Web) has become the means of distribution and use of information by individuals around the world. However, access to this information by visually impaired people is limited due to the Web's visual complexity that implicitly helps sighted users understand and interact with the page content. A variety of usability and accessibility studies show that complicated Web page structure depends on the page composition and layout. During our research we will identify how Web page structural elements, including links, text, and images, interact with each other to produce a visually complex page. In addition we will determine whether pages that sighted users identify as visually complex are complex for visually impaired users as well. ViCRAM is a project that will contribute to the Web Accessibility area by facilitating visually impaired users. We will study sighted users's behaviour and eye movement while interacting with a Web page to elicit their implicit knowledge of visual perception. A relationship will then be distinguished between sighted users' visual cognition and visually impaired users' coping strategies employed when interacting with Web pages. The project's objective is to create a framework that will be used to identify visually complex areas on Web pages for two purposes: to give feedback to visually impaired users regarding the presentation and visual layout of the page; and to help reduce the visual clutter of the page by using the framework as a guide for a Web page transcoding process.

Concomitant dendrometer and leaf patch pressure probe measurements reveal the effect of microclimate and soil moisture on diurnal stem water and leaf turgor variations in young oak trees
Tree water relations and their dependence on microclimate and soil moisture were studied over several months in young oaks (Quercus robur L.) subjected in large lysimeter-based open top chambers to environments with a controlled soil water supply. Automated single point dendrometers and the recently developed leaf patch clamp pressure (LPCP) probe were used for monitoring water-related stem radius variations (ΔW) and turgor-dependent leaf patch pressures (Pp). Both parameters showed distinct diurnal patterns with sharp negative and positive peaking of ΔW and Pp, respectively, after solar noon and recovery to initial levels in the evening. During the day, varying solar radiation was responsible for short time fluctuations of Pp in the range of minutes to hours reflecting feedback regulation of leaf turgor by sunlight driven stomatal movements. At longer timescales, i.e. days to months, atmospheric vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and soil water content (SWC) were the main determinants of ΔW and Pp. Daily minimum and maximum values of ΔW and Pp decreased and increased, respectively, with increasing VPD or decreasing SWC and recovery of ΔW and Pp in the evening was impeded by low SWC. In well-watered oaks, daily positive peaking of Pp preceded daily negative peaking of ΔW; these time lags gradually increased with increasing soil drought, suggesting hydraulic uncoupling of stem and leaves.

Quasi-resonances in sound-insulating coatings
This paper is concerned with the radiation of sound waves from a submerged cylindrical body which is coated by an imperfect elastic layer; that is, the coating only covers part of the cylinder. The focus of the study is to quantify the effect of the gap in the elastic layer on the radiated acoustic power. A finite element method is employed to determine the acoustic pressure field in the fluid and the displacement field in the coupled layer. This reveals that the effect of a modest sized gap in the coating does not markedly alter the radiated field except at distinct frequencies, at which values the coating exhibits strong fluid-coupled oscillations. We develop a simple analytical model to explain the resonance phenomenon and show that quasi-resonances arise when the wavelength of the deformation pattern 'matches' the azimuthal length of the surface of the coating. This resonant behaviour is conveniently captured by a single parameter Q, which is the ratio of the typical inertial fluid pressure induced by the wall oscillation to the stiffness of the elastic coating. For each choice of material parameters, there is shown to be an infinite set of values of Q corresponding to distinct quasi-resonance mode numbers. The effects on the radiated field due to variations in various physical parameters, such as acoustic wavenumber and elastic layer inertia, are also discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Reading Codicological Form in John Gower’s Trentham Manuscript
In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:
The broad agreement that has emerged in recent years on the relevance of paleographical and codicological evidence to literary interpretation in medieval studies has not yielded analogous consensus on best practices for such interdisciplinary endeavors, particularly when we begin thinking about whole manuscripts rather than individual texts.1 This dilemma stems largely from the “oscillation between the planned and the random” that the construction of medieval literary manuscripts so often seems to display.2 On the one hand, the fact that the great majority of them were commissioned for specific purposes or patrons makes it likely that some logic would have animated their assemblage. Yet many factors, on the other, combine to make such logics extremely difficult to retrieve. Exemplar poverty rather than thematic connections may have led two texts to cohabit in a given manuscript; a short poem juxtaposed with a longer one may be there simply because it fits the space the scribe had left in the quire, and not because of the echoes of phrasing and image between the two. Literary scholars, trained to make arguments about thematic connections and formal echoes, are naturally inclined to see such ideational and aesthetic considerations at work rather than more mechanical ones, and this inescapable predisposition makes it both difficult and vital for us to grapple with the question of when it is legitimate to propose literary interpretations of manuscripts’ codicological features, using those features to support readings of texts they contain.

[second-generation, antipsychotic, drug, first-generation, ep, group, term, week]

Extrapyramidal motor side-effects of first- and second-generation antipsychotic drugs.
BACKGROUND: Second-generation antipsychotics have been thought to cause fewer extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS) than first-generation antipsychotics, but recent pragmatic trials have indicated equivalence. AIMS: To determine whether second-generation antipsychotics had better outcomes in terms of EPS than first-generation drugs. METHOD: We conducted an intention-to-treat, secondary analysis of data from an earlier randomised controlled trial (n = 227). A clinically significant difference was defined as double or half the symptoms in groups prescribed first- v. second-generation antipsychotics, represented by odds ratios greater than 2.0 (indicating advantage for first-generation drugs) or less than 0.5 (indicating advantage for the newer drugs). We also examined EPS in terms of symptoms emergent at 12 weeks and 52 weeks, and symptoms that had resolved at these time points. RESULTS: At baseline those randomised to the first-generation antipsychotic group (n = 118) had similar EPS to the second-generation group (n = 109). Indications of resolved Parkinsonism (OR = 0.5) and akathisia (OR = 0.4) and increased tardive dyskinesia (OR = 2.2) in the second-generation drug group at 12 weeks were not statistically significant and the effects were not present by 52 weeks. Patients in the second-generation group were dramatically (30-fold) less likely to be prescribed adjunctive anticholinergic medication, despite equivalence in terms of EPS. CONCLUSIONS: The expected improvement in EPS profiles for participants randomised to second-generation drugs was not found; the prognosis over 1 year of those in the first-generation arm was no worse in these terms. The place of careful prescription of first-generation drugs in contemporary practice remains to be defined, potentially improving clinical effectiveness and avoiding life-shortening metabolic disturbances in some patients currently treated with the narrow range of second-generation antipsychotics used in routine practice. This has educational implications because a generation of psychiatrists now has little or no experience with first-generation antipsychotic prescription.

Hybrid Composites of Polyaniline/Modified Carbon Nanoparticles Employed as Highly Sensitive Ammonia Sensors on Flexible Substrates
Fabrication of low-cost and low-power chemical sensors on flexible substrates is aimed to open new applications in environmental monitoring and smart food packaging. Polyaniline (PANI), known for its excellent gas sensing properties, reversibly interacts with ammonia causing a significant decrease in its conductivity. By utilizing composites of PANI and carbon-based materials enhanced sensitivity toward amines has been observed. However, lack of solution processability has limited implementation of these materials in conventional flexible sensor fabrication methods. Here, we have prepared hybrid carbon/PANI composite NH3 sensors using low-cost solution deposition methods. Sulfosuccinic acid, a multifunctional dopant, has been used to make electrically conducting polyaniline solutions in aprotic solvents, and these were characterised by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Hybrid composites were made by simply mixing surface modified carbon nanoparticles (20 wt.%) into doped PANI solution. Chemiresistors were fabricated on PEN and Kapton® flexible substrates incorporating gold and silver interdigitated electrodes (20 µm gap), using drop casting and spin coating methods. The response of the sensor towards NH3 vapour concentrations in the range of 200 ppb to 2 ppm was measured and compared to that of a conventional MOS ammonia sensor. The effect of different substrates, electrode materials and deposition methods used were investigated. Successful fabrication of a low-power sensor with repeatable and reproducible response with sensitivities up to 5 times higher than MOS sensors, together with response and recovery times in minutes was achieved. The excellent performance parameters make these flexible hybrid nanocomposite materials, attractive candidates for replacing conventional MOS sensors for low-power, real-time ammonia sensing applications.(This work was supported by FlexSMELL-FP7-PEOPLE-ITN-2008-238454.)

Enhanced Stability of Superheavy Nuclei Due to High-Spin Isomerism
<p>Configuration-constrained calculations of potential-energy surfaces in even-even superheavy nuclei reveal systematically the existence at low excitation energies of multiquasiparticle states with deformed axially symmetric shapes and large angular momenta. These results indicate the prevalence of long-lived, multiquasiparticle isomers. In a quantal system, the ground state is usually more stable than the excited states. In contrast, in superheavy nuclei the multiquasiparticle excitations decrease the probability for both fission and alpha decay, implying enhanced stability. Hence, the systematic occurrence of multiquasiparticle isomers may become crucial for future production and study of even heavier nuclei. The energies of multiquasiparticle states and their alpha decays are calculated and compared to available data.</p>

The cost-effectiveness of clozapine: a controlled, population-based, mirror-image study
A retrospective cohort study, with a mirror-image design, was used to measure inpatient service utilization in 63 consecutive patients started on clozapine from a geographical catchment area compared to a control group matched for previous inpatient service use. An intent-to-treat analysis, including those patients (n = 28) who discontinued clozapine during the study period, showed a significant reduction in number of admissions and total time spent in hospital in the 2 years following clozapine initiation compared to the previous 2 years and to the follow-up period in the control group. This translated into a reduction of £7300 in hospitalization costs per patient started on clozapine, over the 2-year period. In those patients whocontinued clozapine treatment for the whole of the 2-year period, there was a two-thirds reduction in number of admissions and total time spent in hospital compared to no change in the clozapine discontinuers. These findings suggest that clozapine is a clinically and cost-effective intervention for severe schizophrenia in routine clinical settings.

A qualitative exploration of a respiratory distress symptom cluster in lung cancer: cough, breathlessness and fatigue.
UNLABELLED: There is a growing awareness that symptoms frequently co-occur in 'symptom clusters' and that understanding these clusters may improve the management of unrelieved symptoms in patients. In-depth longitudinal exploration of lung cancer patients' symptom experiences is used to examine patient symptom experiences and distress across the disease trajectory of lung cancer. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients and their primary caregivers at four time points: at the beginning of treatment and then subsequently at three, six, and twelve months. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was employed in the data analysis. FINDINGS: Findings indicate that a cluster of interacting respiratory symptoms play a central role in patients' symptom experiences within the lung cancer population. The interviews also suggest that symptoms such as cough which are under-represented in research within this population may play an important role in patients' symptom experiences. DISCUSSION: Longitudinal qualitative investigation offers a valuable method for improving our understanding of patients' experiences of lung cancer and for identifying potential opportunities to improve patient quality of life.

Comprehensive assessment of rheumatoid arthritis susceptibility loci in a large psoriatic arthritis cohort.
OBJECTIVE: A number of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) susceptibility genes have been identified in recent years. Given the overlap in phenotypic expression of synovial joint inflammation between RA and psoriatic arthritis (PsA), the authors explored whether RA susceptibility genes are also associated with PsA. METHODS: 56 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mapping to 41 genes previously reported as RA susceptibility loci were selected for investigation. PsA was defined as an inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis and subjects were recruited from the UK and Ireland. Genotyping was performed using the Sequenom MassArray platform and frequencies compared with data derived from large UK control collections. RESULTS: Significant evidence for association with susceptibility to PsA was found toa SNP mapping to the REL (rs13017599, p(trend)=5.2×10(4)) gene, while nominal evidence for association (p(trend)<0.05) was found to seven other loci including PLCL2 (rs4535211, p=1.7×10(-3)); STAT4 (rs10181656, p=3.0×10(-3)) and the AFF3, CD28, CCL21, IL2 and KIF5A loci. Interestingly, three SNPs demonstrated opposite effects to those reported for RA. CONCLUSIONS: The REL gene, a key modulator of the NFκB pathway, is associated with PsA but the allele conferring risk to RA is protective in PsA suggesting that there are fundamental differences in the aetiological mechanisms underlying these two types of inflammatory arthritis.

DETERMINANTS OF WOMEN’S EMPOWERMENT IN COOPERATIVES SOCIETIES: SURVEY EVIDENCE FROM SOUTH EASTERN TIGRAI, ETHIOPIA
Women constitute more than half of the Ethiopian population; their socio-economic condition especially in rural areas remains worst than any other time. Rural women belong to the most marginalized section of the society facing adverse conditions in terms of social oppression and economic inequality, a visible majority of them being extremely deprived. Considering this scenario, this paper investigates the key determinants of the socio-economic empowerment of Ethiopian women's in a cooperative society. The methodology of this study is quantitative based on the data collected from five primary cooperatives found in Degua Tembien Woreda. The data was mainly primary data, from 67 randomly selected women member of a cooperatives and secondary data was collected from the documents of the societies. Tables, percentages, and multiple regressions analysis were used to analyze the collected data. Considering its multidimensional nature and aspects, a cumulative index for women empowerment is constructed using three indices i.e. personal autonomy, family unit decision making and domestic economic decisions. In this study, it was&nbsp; found&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; income,&nbsp; education&nbsp; level,&nbsp; training,&nbsp; years&nbsp; of stay in the cooperatives, marital status and asset ownership are statistically significant at all levels and have positive impact on women empowerment. Conversely, number of dependents, age of the women, loan size and number of dependents are inversely related with dependent variable Cumulative Empowerment Index (CEI). Finally, concerted efforts like extension work and rural development campaign should be&nbsp;&nbsp; undertaken so as to improve women empowerment by concentrating on the significant factors by the major intervening agencies. &nbsp; KEY WORDS: Empowerment, cooperatives, decision making, multiple regressions. &nbsp;

Modelling neutral hydrogen in galaxies using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations
The characterization of the atomic and molecular hydrogen content ofhigh-redshift galaxies is a major observational challenge that will beaddressed over the coming years with a new generation of radiotelescopes. We investigate this important issue by considering thestates of hydrogen across a range of structures within high-resolutioncosmological hydrodynamical simulations. In addition, our simulationsallow us to investigate the sensitivity of our results to numericalresolution and to sub-grid baryonic physics (especially feedback fromsupernovae and active galactic nuclei). We find that the mostsignificant uncertainty in modelling the neutral hydrogen distributionarises from our need to model a self-shielding correction in moderatedensity regions. Future simulations incorporating radiative transferschemes will be vital to improve on our empirical self-shieldingthreshold. Irrespective of the exact nature of the threshold, we findthat while the atomic hydrogen mass function evolves only mildly fromredshift two to zero, the molecular hydrogen mass function increaseswith increasing redshift, especially at the high-mass end.Interestingly, the weak evolution of the neutral hydrogen mass functionis insensitive to the feedback scheme utilized, but the opposite is truefor the molecular gas, which is more closely associated with the starformation in the simulations.

High resoln. synchrotron microtomog. and strain mapping of individual fibers were performed at the ESRF, Grenoble, France. In this manner, the strain distributions along individual fibers have been measured in relation to matrix and fiber cracking for a fatigue cracked Ti/SiC fiber composite specimen. The interfacial shear stress distributions in the bridging fibers were derived from the fiber strains. These indicate how the extent of debonding decreases from the notch towards the crack tip. The debonding behavior was modelled using a partial debonding shear lag model. Upon unloading the sliding of the debonded regions reversed leading to fretting wear and an assocd. redn. in interface shear strength near the crack relative to monotonic loading tests. on SciFinder (R)

[incidence, mortality, trial, cancer, population, woman]

Impact on mortality and cancer incidence rates of using random invitation from population registers for recruitment to trials.
BACKGROUND: Participants in trials evaluating preventive interventions such as screening are on average healthier than the general population. To decrease this 'healthy volunteer effect' (HVE) women were randomly invited from population registers to participate in the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) and not allowed to self refer. This report assesses the extent of the HVE still prevalent in UKCTOCS and considers how certain shortfalls in mortality and incidence can be related to differences in socioeconomic status. METHODS: Between 2001 and 2005, 202 638 postmenopausal women joined the trial out of 1 243 312 women randomly invited from local health authority registers. The cohort was flagged for deaths and cancer registrations and mean follow up at censoring was 5.55 years for mortality, and 2.58 years for cancer incidence. Overall and cause-specific Standardised Mortality Ratios (SMRs) and Standardised Incidence Ratios (SIRs) were calculated based on national mortality (2005) and cancer incidence (2006) statistics. The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD 2007) was used to assess the link between socioeconomic status and mortality/cancer incidence, and differences between the invited and recruited populations. RESULTS: The SMR for all trial participants was 37%. By subgroup, the SMRs were higher for: younger age groups, extremes of BMI distribution and with each increasing year in trial. There was a clear trend between lower socioeconomic status and increased mortality but less pronounced with incidence. While the invited population had higher mean IMD scores (more deprived) than the national average, those who joined the trial were less deprived. CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment to screening trials through invitation from population registers does not prevent a pronounced HVE on mortality. The impact on cancer incidence is much smaller. Similar shortfalls can be expected in other screening RCTs and it maybe prudent to use the various mortality and incidence rates presented as guides for calculating event rates and power in RCTs involving women.

Skin and nail responses after 1 year of infliximab therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis: a retrospective analysis of the EXPRESS Trial.
BACKGROUND: The EXPRESS study demonstrated the initial efficacy of infliximab in psoriasis affecting the skin and nails. OBJECTIVE: To further assess how patients with a positive initial response to infliximab respond to 1 year of continuous infliximab treatment. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients with moderate-to-severe plaque and nail psoriasis who initiated and continued infliximab treatment up to week 46 was conducted. RESULTS: Among all nail psoriasis patients receiving 1 year of infliximab (n = 186), 74.6 and 54.1% achieved at least 75 or 90% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) at week 50. These PASI-75 (n = 138) and PASI-90 (n = 100) responders had respective mean improvements from baseline to week 50 of 93.6 and 97.3% for the PASI, 90.6 and 94.1% for the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and 78.2 and 80.3% for the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI). CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab treatment for 1 year produced sustained improvement in PASI, DLQI and NAPSI scores.

Increased phosphorylated p38 mitogen activated protein kinase in COPD lungs.
The p38 Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway is upregulated in COPD. To date dual-labelling to identify cell-type specific presence of phosphorylated (phospho-) p38 MAPK has not been carried out.Phospho-p38 MAPK was quantified in a variety of cell types in the lung tissue of 20 COPD patients, 12 smokers and 12 non-smokers using immunohistochemistry. Paired blood and sputum neutrophils (n=7 COPD), and CD8 and epithelial cells (n=3 COPD) were cultured with a p38 MAPK inhibitor. Supernatant TNFα, CXCL8 levels were analysed by ELISA. Sputum and blood neutrophil cytospins were analysed for phospho-p38 MAPK.Phospho-p38 MAPK was increased in bronchial epithelial cells, macrophages and CD20+and CD8+lymphocytes in COPD lungs. Sputum and lung tissue neutrophils were devoid of phospho-p38 in all patient groups. The p38 MAPK inhibitor SB100 attenuated pro-inflammatory mediator release in COPD lung CD8 cells and airway epithelia but there was no effect on COPD sputum neutrophils. Our data indicates cell specific anti-inflammatory effects of p38 MAPK inhibition in the lung.

The central theme of the paper is concerned with the educational potential that patient narratives may hold for improving patient-centred interprofessional care. It follows the processes of a research project that was required to provide an educational intervention in a multiprofessionally-staffed stroke rehabilitation ward. It discusses the evolution of the project, focusing on the ways in which patient narratives were constructed, the purposes they served, and the responses of professionals to the narratives in subsequent workshops. Along the way, the paper reflects on the responses of patients that problematise the notion of "patient-centred" care. Together with the responses of professionals to the narratives, the paper raises questions about the obstacles to and possibilities for such care.

The results were obtained by femtosecond resolved pump-pump photocurrent experiments using a free electron laser (wavelength 7.9 mu m). Additionally, the intensity dependence of the nonlinear photocurrent response was measured. Both types of experiments were simulated using a density matrix description. With one parameter set, a consistent modeling was achieved confirming the significance of the extracted heavy hole relaxation times.

The Role of ERK5 in Cell Proliferation
The extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 5 (ERK5), also known as big mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase 1 (BMK1), is a non-redundant mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) implicated in mediating the response of cells to mitogens, oxidative and osmotic stresses. The molecular complexity of the ERK5 cascade has been mostly delineated by over-expression studies. For example, like other MAPKs, ERK5 activity increases upon phosphorylation by a MAPK/ERK kinase, namely MEK5. However, the physiological role of ERK5 is not rigorously established by these data. Furthermore, in comparison to the other members of the family, little is known about the downstream targets of ERK5. This constitutes an obstacle for the molecular understanding of the signalling mechanisms that account for the effect of ERK5 activation in vivo. To clarify these issues, I have tested the effect of the conditional loss of ERK5 in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). My results indicate that ERK5 is required for the proliferation of MEFs, at least in part, by promoting the entry into S phase of the cell cycle. ERK5 suppressed the expression of the cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) inhibitors, p21 and p27. As a result, low-level CDK2 activity detected in ERK5-deficient MEFs correlated with hypo-phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein and with a defect in G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle. ERK5 blocks p21 expression by decreasing the stability of the p21 transcript. This process might, at least partially, involve a mechanism implicating c-Myc-induced transcriptional up-regulation of the miR-17-92 cluster. Concerning p27, ERK5 decreases p27 protein stability. The stabilisation of p27 in the absence of ERK5 resulted in the accumulation of the protein in the nucleus. To examine the relevance of my findings in cancer, I tested the effect of pharmacological inhibition of ERK5 in two human breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and MDA- MB-231, using XMD8-92, a novel potent and selective inhibitor of ERK5. My results show that these cells are dependent on ERK5 to proliferate. Furthermore, I found that incubation of MDA- MB-231 cells with XMD8-92 compromised their ability to invade. In both breast cancer cell lines, ERK5 down-regulates p21 and p27 expression. Together with evidence that cancer patients with poor prognosis display a high-level of expression of components of the ERK5 signalling pathway, these findings support the hypothesis that ERK5 can be a potential target for cancer therapy.

Differential cadherin expression: potential markers for epithelial to mesenchymal transformation during tumor progression.
The cadherin family of adhesion moleculesregulates cell–cell interactions during development and intissues. The prototypical cadherin, E-cadherin, is responsiblefor maintaining interactions of epithelial cells and isfrequently downregulated during tumor progression. Ncadherin,normally found in fibroblasts and neural cells,can be upregulated during tumor progression and canincrease the invasiveness of tumor cells. The proinvasiveeffects of N-cadherin expression in tumor cells result fromtwo possible mechanisms: promotion of tumor cell interactionswith the N-cadherin-expressing microenvironment,or enhancement of signaling via the fibroblast growth factorreceptor. The downregulation of E-cadherin and the upregulationof N-cadherin in tumors may be a result of an epithelialto mesenchymal transformation (EMT) of tumor cells, whichis notoriously difficult to detect in vivo. Double labeling of individual tumors with specific E- and N-cadherin antibodiessuggests that EMT can occur heterogeneously and/ortransiently within an invasive tumor.Keywords Adhesion . Metastasis .

Fall incidence and outcomes of falls in a prospective study of adults with rheumatoid arthritis
Objective

To determine the incidence of falls and to investigate the consequences of falls in adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Methods

A total of 559 community-dwelling adults with RA, ages 18–88 years (mean age 62 years, 69% women), participated in this prospective cohort study. After a detailed clinical assessment, patients were followed for 1 year, using monthly falls calendars and followup telephone calls. Followup took place in the participant's usual place of residence in the Northwest of England. Outcome measures included fall occurrence, reason for fall, type and severity of injuries, fractures, fall location, lie-times, use of health services, and functional ability.
Results

A total of 535 participants followed for 1 year had a total of 598 falls. Of these participants, 36.4% (95% confidence interval 32%–41%) reported falling during the 1-year followup period, with an incidence rate of 1,313 per 1,000 person-years at risk or 1.11 falls per person. Age and sex were not associated with falls. More than one-third of the falls were reportedly caused by hips, knees, or ankle joints “giving way.” More than half of all the falls resulted in moderate injuries, including head injuries (n = 27) and fractures (n = 26). Treatment by general practitioners or other health professionals was required for 15.0% of falls, and emergency services were required for 8.8% of falls.
Conclusion

These results indicate that adults with RA are at high risk of falls and fall-related injuries, fractures, and head injuries. Strategies to prevent falls in adults with RA must be prioritized to reduce falls, fall-related injuries, and fractures.

Chronic cough: relationship between microaspiration, gastroesophageal reflux, and cough frequency.
BACKGROUND: Microaspiration is often considered a potential cause of cough. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between microaspiration, the degree and type of gastroesophageal reflux, and the frequency of coughing in patients with chronic cough. METHODS: One hundred patients with chronic cough (mean ± SD age, 55.8 years ± 11.0 years; 65 women) and 32 healthy volunteers (median age, 43.5 years interquartile range (IQR), 30-50.8 years; 16 women) were recruited. Patients with chronic cough performed 24-h objective cough frequency with simultaneous esophageal impedance/pH monitoring and measurement of pepsin concentrations in sputum and BAL. Twelve healthy volunteers underwent bronchoscopy/BAL, and 20 underwent impedance/pH monitoring. RESULTS: Patients with chronic cough had significantly more reflux episodes than healthy volunteers (median, 63.5 reflux episodes IQR, 52.5-80.0 vs 59.0 IQR, 41.8-66.0; P = .03), although the absolute difference was small, and there was no difference in numbers of events extending into the proximal esophagus (median, 17.2% IQR, 8.0%-26.0% vs 20.3% IQR, 5.1%-32.1%; P = .36). BAL pepsin levels were also similar in chronic cough to control subjects (median, 18.2 ng/mL range, 0-56.4 ng/mL vs 9.25 ng/mL range, 0-46.9 ng/mL; P = .27). Sputum but not BAL pepsin weakly correlated with the number of proximally occurring reflux events (r = 0.33, P = .045) but was inversely related to cough frequency (r = −0.52, P = .04). Sputum pepsin was, therefore, best predicted by combining the opposing influences of cough and proximal reflux (r = 0.50, P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Proximal gastroesophageal reflux and microaspiration into the airways have limited roles in provoking chronic cough. Indeed, coughing appears to be protective, reducing pepsin concentration in the larger airways of patients with chronic cough.

Man in a briefcase: the social construction of the laptop computer and the emergence of a type form
<p>Dominant design discourse of the late 1970s and early 1980s presented the introduction of the laptop computer to be the result of ‘inevitable’ progress in a variety of disparate technologies, pulled together to create an unprecedented, revolutionary technological product. While the laptop was a revolutionary product, such a narrative works to dismiss a series of products which predated the laptop but which had much the same aim, and to deny a social drive for such products, which had been in evidence for a number of years before the technology to achieve them was available. This article shows that the social drive for the development of portable computing came in part from the ‘macho mystique’ of concealed technology that was a substantial motif in popular culture at that time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Using corporate promotional material from the National Archive for the History of Computing at the University of Manchester, and interviews with some of the designers and engineers involved in the creation of early portable computers, this work explores the development of the first real laptop computer, the ‘GRiD Compass’, in the context of its contemporaries. The consequent trajectory of laptop computer design is then traced to show how it has become a product which has a mixture of associated meanings to a wide range of consumers. In this way, the work explores the role of consumption in the development of digital technology.</p>

Patients’ and carers’ views of quality palliative and supportive district nursing care
Quality of care is conceptualised by professionals and in policy documents as: compliance with ‘best practice’ guidelines; improving satisfaction rates; fiscal efficiency; and ethical care. ‘Quality’ in palliative and supportive district nursing care has been conceptualised in all these ways. However, the empirical research in this area draws mostly on professionals’ and carers’ views with little research addressing patients’ views. With political rhetoric pushing for a ‘patient led’ NHS, research into how patients conceptualise quality in this area is necessary to both critique this rhetoric and/or facilitate its aims. Therefore, this research investigates patients’ and carers’ views on the quality of palliative and supportive district nursing care.Participants were recruited to an exploratory qualitative study resulting in a convenience sample of twenty six patients (all of district nursing caseloads) and thirteen carers. All participants were over eighteen, able to consent, lived in their own homes, were under the care of district nurses, and had palliative care needs. Eighteen participants had a cancer diagnosis, six had a non-malignant diagnosis, one had co-morbidities, and one participant did not disclosed their diagnosis. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with all participants, five participants were interviewed twice. Post-structuralist theories were used with discourse analysis techniques for the final analysis.The findings identify three of the most influential discourses in relation to the morality and quality of care: Firstly, ‘busyness’, and how its performance by district nurses masks patients’ and carers’ ability to critique care, instead producing a pseudo-quality which fixes patients and carers subjectivities. Secondly, ‘power/knowledge’ and the ways in which it prevents patients and carers accessing care which they need, and altering care to suit their needs. Thirdly, ‘the home’ and how it (re)forms district nursing care and district nursing care (re)forms the home; meaning that actions by district nurses must also consider the impact on the home as well as the patients and carers. In conclusion quality care may be produced by: ceasing to measure quality; involving patients and carers with commissioning and directing palliative and supportive care; supporting groups other than district nurses such as patients, carers and third parties to produce and distribute knowledge about district nursing care; increasing patients’ and carers’ ability to communicate with one another about their care.Further research may investigate: how patients and carers with palliative and supportive care needs may be involved in commissioning; the most appropriate wording and means to distribute knowledge about palliative and supportive district nursing care; ethnographic work to explore how district nursing and the home interact; more detailed theorisation of how the material and the discursive can be accounted for within post-structuralism.

Calcium flux balance in the heart.
This article reviews the consequences of the need for the cardiac cell to be in calcium flux balance in the steady state. We first discuss how this steady state condition affects the control of resting Ca(2+)i. The next section considers how sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca content is controlled by a feedback mechanism whereby changes of SR Ca affect the amplitude of the Ca transient and this, in turn, controls sarcolemmal Ca fluxes. Subsequent sections review the effects of altering the activity of individual Ca handling proteins. Increasing the activity of the SR Ca-ATPase (SERCA) increases both the amplitude and rate constant of decay of the systolic Ca transient. The Ca flux balance condition requires that this must be achieved with no change of Ca efflux placing constraints on the magnitude of change of amplitude and decay rate. We analyze the quantitative dependence of Ca transient amplitude and SR content on SERCA activity. Increasing the open probability of the RyR during systole is predicted to have no steady state effect on the amplitude of the systolic Ca transient. We discuss the effects of changing the amplitude of the L-type Ca current in the context of both triggering Ca release from the SR and loading the cell with calcium. These manoeuvres are considered in the context of the effects of β-adrenergic stimulation. Finally, we review calcium flux balance in the presence of Ca waves.

Synergistic effects of imatinib (STI 571) in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs in head and neck cancer.
The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (STI 571; glivec) is a potent inhibitor of bcr-abl, c-kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptors. Imatinib was evaluated both alone and in combination with established chemotherapeutic agents in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) primary cultures and established cell lines representing squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC). Over 90% of ACC tumors are c-kit-positive, and these primary cultures proved to be of short-term usefulness in assessing chemosensitivity. Interaction was determined over a wide range of drug combinations using a statistical three-dimensional analysis model. Both ACC short-term cultures and HNSCC cell lines were demonstrated to have a response ranging from additive to synergistic when imatinib and cisplatin were combined. The interaction of imatinib on cisplatin-induced DNA cross-linking was further investigated using the comet-X assay. In contrast, significant antagonism was observed when imatinib and gemcitabine were combined. Since gemcitabine is activated by deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), the effect of imatinib on this enzyme was investigated. A dose-dependent inhibition of dCK was observed, highlighting this kinase as a possible additional secondary molecular target for imatinib. This work demonstrates a synergistic interaction between cisplatin and imatinib, which may prove to be clinically relevant in the future management of both ACC and HNSCC.

An investigation of rheumatoid arthritis loci in patients with early-onset psoriasis validates association of the REL gene.
Phenotypically diverse autoimmune conditions share common genetic susceptibility loci and underlying molecular pathways. We therefore investigated 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms, previously confirmed as being associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), in a UK cohort of 623 patients with early-onset psoriasis (presenting before age 40y) comparing with 2662 control subjects. Our findings confirm the association of early-onset psoriasis with REL (rs13031237, p=0.0027). The minor allele of REL had opposing effects upon susceptibility to disease in psoriasis and RA patients. Similar exploration of additional autoimmune loci and fine-mapping of such regions may provide further insight into the genetics and molecular pathophysiology of psoriasis.

Top quark spin correlations and leptonic forward-backward asymmetries at D0
The top quark is the heaviest fundamental particle. Its correspondingly short lifetime implies that it will decay before top flavoured hadrons can form. This provides an opportunity to study the properties of a quark without the effects of hadronisation, which is unique in the standard model.Using data recorded by the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron collider, and corresponding to \unit5.4{fb^{-1}} of proton-antiproton collisions two analyses of the production and decay mechanism of top quarks are presented in this thesis. In the standard model the directions of the spin of top quarks produced in pairs by the strong interaction are expected to be correlated. In the first analysis, the strength of the correlation is extracted from the angles of the two leptons in the top quark and antiquark rest frames, yielding a correlation strength C=0.10\pm0.45. This is in agreement with the NLO QCD prediction within two standard deviations, but also in agreement with the no correlation hypothesis.In the second analysis, forward-backward asymmetries in top quark-antiquark production are measured using the charged leptons from top quark decays. We find that the angular distributions of \ell^{\mathrm{-}} relative to antiprotons and \ell^{+} relative to protons are in agreement with each other. Combining the two distributions and correcting for detector acceptance we obtain the forward-backward asymmetry \al=\left(5.8\pm5.1\mathrm{(stat)}\pm1.3\mathrm{(syst)}\right)\%, compared to the standard model prediction of \al\mathrm{(predicted)}=\left(4.7\pm0.1\right)\%.

Background: Large microarray datasets have enabled gene regulation to be studied through coexpression analysis. While numerous methods have been developed for identifying differentially expressed genes between two conditions, the field of differential coexpression analysis is still relatively new. More specifically, there is so far no sensitive and untargeted method to identify gene modules (also known as gene sets or clusters) that are differentially coexpressed between two conditions. Here, sensitive and untargeted means that the method should be able to construct de novo modules by grouping genes based on shared, but subtle, differential correlation patterns.Results: We present DiffCoEx, a novel method for identifying correlation pattern changes, which builds on the commonly used Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) framework for coexpression analysis. We demonstrate its usefulness by identifying biologically relevant, differentially coexpressed modules in a rat cancer dataset.Conclusions: DiffCoEx is a simple and sensitive method to identify gene coexpression differences between multiple conditions.

Vitamin k deficiency is associated with incident knee osteoarthritis.
BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, with knee osteoarthritis being the leading cause of lower extremity disability among older adults in the US. There are no treatments available to prevent the structural pathology of osteoarthritis. Because of vitamin K's role in regulating skeletal mineralization, it has potential to be a preventative option for osteoarthritis. We therefore examined the relation of vitamin K to new-onset radiographic knee osteoarthritis and early osteoarthritis changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: Subjects from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis (MOST) Study had knee radiographs and MRI scans obtained at baseline and 30 months later, and plasma phylloquinone (vitamin K) measured at baseline. We examined the relationship of subclinical vitamin K deficiency to incident radiographic knee osteoarthritis and MRI-based cartilage lesions and osteophytes, respectively, using log binomial regression with generalized estimating equations, adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Among 1180 participants (62% women, mean age 62±8 years, mean body mass index 30.1±5.1 kg/m(2)), subclinical vitamin K deficiency was associated with incident radiographic knee osteoarthritis (risk ratio RR 1.56; 95% confidence interval CI, 1.08-2.25) and cartilage lesions (RR 2.39; 95% CI, 1.05-5.40) compared with no deficiency, but not with osteophytes (RR 2.35; 95% CI, 0.54-10.13). Subclinically vitamin K-deficient subjects were more likely to develop osteoarthritis in one or both knees than neither knee (RR 1.33; 95% CI, 1.01-1.75 and RR 2.12; 95% CI, 1.06-4.24, respectively). CONCLUSION: In the first such longitudinal study, subclinical vitamin K deficiency was associated with increased risk of developing radiographic knee osteoarthritis and MRI-based cartilage lesions. Further study of vitamin K is warranted given its therapeutic/prophylactic potential for osteoarthritis.

Rank products: A simple, yet powerful, new method to detect differentially regulated genes in replicated microarray experiments
One of the main objectives in the analysis of microarray experiments is the identification of genes that are differentially expressed under two experimental conditions. This task is complicated by the noisiness of the data and the large number of genes that are examined simultaneously. Here, we present a novel technique for identifying differentially expressed genes that does not originate from a sophisticated statistical model but rather from an analysis of biological reasoning. The new technique, which is based on calculating rank products (RP) from replicate experiments, is fast and simple. At the same time, it provides a straightforward and statistically stringent way to determine the significance level for each gene and allows for the flexible control of the false-detection rate and familywise error rate in the multiple testing situation of a microarray experiment. We use the RP technique on three biological data sets and show that in each case it performs more reliably and consistently than the non-parametric t-test variant implemented in Tusher et al.'s significance analysis of microarrays (SAM). We also show that the RP results are reliable in highly noisy data. An analysis of the physiological function of the identified genes indicates that the RP approach is powerful for identifying biologically relevant expression changes. In addition, using RP can lead to a sharp reduction in the number of replicate experiments needed to obtain reproducible results. ?? 2004 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

Left ventricular function and oesophageal function in patients with angina pectoris and normal coronary angiograms.
Left ventricular function and oesophageal function (including oesophageal manometry and pH monitoring) were investigated and a psychiatric assessment carried out in 63 patients with angina pectoris and normal coronary angiograms. Twenty two (35%) patients had regional abnormalities of left ventricular wall motion (group A). Thirty six (57%) patients had an oesophageal abnormality (group B); 19 patients had gastro-oesophageal reflux and abnormal oesophageal motility, five had gastro-oesophageal reflux alone, and 12 had abnormal oesophageal motility alone. Only four had regional abnormalities of the left ventricular wall and abnormal oesophageal function. In nine (14%) patients left ventricular and oesophageal function were normal (group C). Psychiatric morbidity was significantly less common in group A than in groups B and C and was similar in group B and group C. A definite abnormality of left ventricular function, oesophageal function, or psychiatric morbidity is present in a high proportion of patients with angina pectoris and normal coronary angiograms and in some instances this may lead to specific treatment. If quantitative assessment of left ventricular function is normal, oesophageal investigations should be performed. Endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract may demonstrate oesophageal disease, but, if findings are normal, oesophageal manometry and ambulatory oesophageal pH monitoring (including during treadmill exercise testing) should be carried out.

Review of "Unanticipated Gains: Origins of Network Inequality in Everyday Life."
In Unanticipated Gains: Origins of Network Inequality in Everyday Life
Mario Small illustrates the importance of organizations in producing network-
based inequality. Small argues that organizations play an underappreciated
role in social capital research. Organizations are important
because network connections often develop inside of organizations, and
the broader organizational context in which a network connection develops
can determine how much the connection is worth. Small contrasts
his “organizational embeddedness” perspective with theoretical frameworks
that have focused on network consequences as the expense of
network origins or have adopted a rational actor perspective, where actors
develop network connections in pursuit of the benefits those connections can provide, and have ignored the broader organizational context in which
network connections develop. He illustrates the value of his perspective
with childcare centers in New York City. If you are wondering why
childcare centers, finish the book, and you will appreciate the critical role
these centers play in the lives of many New Yorkers.

Electron Field Emission From Room Temperature Grown Carbon Nanofibers
<p>The observation of field induced electron emission from room temperature grown carbon nanofibers at low (5 V/mum) macroscopic electric fields is reported. The nanofibers were deposited using methane as a source gas in a conventional rf plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition reactor using a Ni metal catalyst previously subjected to an Ar plasma treatment. Analysis of the scanning electron microscopy images of the nanofibers show them to possess an average diameter of 300 nm and that the nanofibers are observed to be radially dispersed over an area of 50 mum in diameter. No evidence of hysteresis in the current-voltage characteristic or conditioning of the emitters is observed. The mechanism for emission at low fields is attributed to field enhancement at the tips rather than from the surrounding amorphous carbon film which is shown to have a higher threshold field (20 V/mum) for emission.</p>

Cytosolic thioredoxin system facilitates the import of mitochondrial small Tim proteins.
Thiol-disulphide redox regulation has a key role during the biogenesis of mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) proteins. Only the Cys-reduced form of precursor proteins can be imported into mitochondria, which is followed by disulphide bond formation in the mitochondrial IMS. In contrast to the wealth of knowledge on the oxidation process inside mitochondria, little is known about how precursors are maintained in an import-competent form in the cytosol. Here we provide the first evidence that the cytosolic thioredoxin system is required to maintain the IMS small Tim proteins in reduced forms and facilitate their mitochondrial import during respiratory growth.

A retrospective cohort study of 113 patients rehabilitated with immediately loaded maxillary cross-arch fixed dental prostheses in combination with immediate implant placement.
PURPOSE: To retrospectively evaluate the outcome of immediately loaded cross-arch fixed dental prostheses 6 months after loading. A second aim was to compare survival rates of implants placed in healed versus fresh extraction sites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 113 consecutive patients about to have their maxillae rendered fully edentulous (mean extractions per patient: 6.7 teeth) received four to eight implants each (total number = 675) which were immediately placed in healed sites (323 implants, 47.9%) or fresh sockets (352 implants, 52.1%). Immediate loading of provisional prostheses was performed and all patients were followed up for 6 months. The success criteria included prosthesis success, assessment of individual implant stability and complications. RESULTS: No patients dropped out and all 113 patients received definitive fixed prostheses after 6 months of loading. The overall implant survival rate after 6 months was 99.1%. Six implants were lost in 6 patients (5.3%). Five of them were inserted in fresh extraction sockets (1.4%) and one in a healed site (0.3%). No significant difference (P = 0.1621) was found for implants placed in healed sites versus fresh extraction sites. Ten patients had fractures of the provisional prostheses as complications. CONCLUSIONS: Immediate implant placement and loading resulted in high implant as well as prosthetic survival rates. Placement in healed or fresh extraction bone sites may not influence implant survival.

Geometry-Induced Rigidity in Nonspherical Pressurized Elastic Shells
We present results from an experimental investigation of the indentation of nonspherical pressurized elastic shells with a positive Gauss curvature. A predictive framework is proposed that rationalizes the dependence of the local rigidity of an indented shell on the curvature in the neighborhood of the locus of indentation, the in-out pressure differential, and the material properties. In our approach, we combine classic theory for spherical shells with recent analytical developments for the pressurized case, and proceed, for the most part, by analogy, guided by our own experiments. By way of example, our results elucidate why an eggshell is significantly stiffer when compressed along its major axis, as compared to doing so along its minor axis. The prominence of geometry in this class of problems points to the relevance and applicability of our findings over a wide range of length scales.

[innate, cell, immune, immunity]

Structured regulation of inflammation during respiratory viral infection.
Innate immune cells including macrophages, dendritic cells, and granulocytes are resident within or patrol very different microenvironments in the host. Their activity or responsiveness to antigen is dictated by site-specific factors. Because of the constant exposure to environmental antigens and commensal microorganisms, mucosal immunity needs to be more constrained than peripheral counterparts to prevent unnecessary inflammation. The epithelial surfaces that dominate all mucosal tissues provide an ideal regulator since innate immune cells are often in intimate contact with, or lie immediately beneath, them and a breach in epithelial integrity would signal a damaging event and release innate immunity from their influence. We discuss the role of the respiratory epithelium in raising the threshold of innate immune cell activation at homoeostasis, how its absence triggers innate immunity, and how inflammatory resolution often produces an altered homoeostatic environment that can affect the next inflammatory event at this site.

An experiment to determine the proximate composition of ensiled cassava peels, cassava peels + Gliricidia sepium, Cassava peels + cassava leaves and cassava peels + Leucaena leucocephala was conducted. Proximate composition of the fresh samples was equally determined. Results obtained were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) as applicable to a completely Randomized Design (CRD). Significant means were separated by Duncan's Multiple Range Test. Silage samples did not differ significantly (P&gt; 0.05) in their physical properties, however, they differed significantly (P&lt;0.05) in their chemical properties. Silage prepared from a mixture of cassava peels + Leucaena leucocephala had the highest crude protein content (24.75%) while that prepared from cassava peels alone had the lowest crude protein content (4.50%). The crude fiber (CF) content of the silages ranged from 13.83% in cassava peel ensiled with Leucaena leucocephala to 17.21% in cassava peels ensiled alone. The calcium content of the silages were significantly different (P&lt;0.05) with the highest (3.01%) in silage prepared from cassava peel + L. leucocephala. &nbsp;The silages were excellently prepared judging from the PH range of 4.17 - 4.32.

Low-temperature magnetization in Ni-rich gamma-Ni100-x-yFexVy alloys
Detailed studies of the temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetization have been made in eight different compositions of gamma-Ni100-x-yFexVy (4 less than or equal to x less than or equal to 17; 2 less than or equal to y less than or equal to 18) alloys at a magnetic field of 30 kOe between 4.2 and 50 K. The values of the Curie temperature (Tc) and the saturation magnetization (Mo) an found to decrease with the increase of V. This is understood since the addition of V (which is antiferromagnetic) suppresses the ferromagnetic order in the NiFe binary alloys. The magnetization of the alloys with low V (y less than or equal to 11 at. %) has shown a good fit to only the spin-wave T-3/2 term whereas the data for the high V (gamma greater than or equal to 12 at. %) alloys require an additional Stoner T-2 term (for weak itinerant ferromagnets). This indicates that the addition of more V gives the alloys a weak itinerant electron character. The range of temperature of the above analysis is much lower than 0.1T(C) for most of the alloys. Also, the Arrott plots near Te show a set of almost parallel isothermal lines supporting the presence of the Stoner term. Thus the present magnetization studies show convincingly a transition from the localized to the weak itinerant electron ferromagnetism in the high V (gamma greater than or equal to 12 at. %) alloys.

Uncertainties in the evolution of stratospheric ozone and implications for recent temperature changes in the tropical lower stratosphere
Observations from satellites and balloons suggest that ozone abundances have decreased in the tropical lower stratosphere since the late 1970s, but this long-term change is occurring in a region of large interannual variability. Three different ozone databases provide regression fits to the ozone observations, and are available for use in model studies of the influence of ozone changes on stratospheric and tropospheric temperatures. Differences between these ozone databases suggest that the estimated decreases of tropical lower stratospheric ozone in recent decades are uncertain by about a factor of two to three. The uncertainties in ozone decreases lead to similar uncertainties in cooling of the tropical lower stratosphere, a key area of focus in climate change studies.

NLRP3-Inflammasome Activating DAMPs Stimulate an Inflammatory Response in Glia in the Absence of Priming Which Contributes to Brain Inflammation after Injury.
Inflammation in the absence of infection (sterile inflammation) contributes to acute injury and chronic disease. Cerebral ischemia is a devastating condition in which the primary injury is caused by reduced blood supply and is therefore sterile. The cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a key contributor to ischemic brain injury and central inflammatory responses. The release of IL-1β is regulated by the protease caspase-1, and its activating complex, the inflammasome. Of the known inflammasomes the best characterized, and one that is perceived to sense sterile injury is formed by a pattern recognition receptor called NOD-like receptor pyrin domain containing three (NLRP3). A key feature of NLRP3-inflammasome dependent responses in vitro in macrophages is the requirement of an initial priming stimulus by a pathogen (PAMP), or damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) respectively. We sought to determine the inflammatory responses of NLRP3-activating DAMPs on brain derived mixed glial cells in the absence of an initial priming stimulus in vitro. In cultured mouse mixed glia the DAMPs ATP, monosodium urate, and calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate crystals had no effect on the expression of IL-1α or IL-1β and induced release only when the cells were primed with a PAMP. In the absence of priming, these DAMPs did however induce inflammation via the production of IL-6 and CXCL1, and the release of the lysosomal protease cathepsin B. Furthermore, the acute phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA) acted as a priming stimulus on glial cells resulting in levels of IL-1 expression comparable to those induced by the PAMP lipopolysaccharide. In vivo, after cerebral ischemia, IL-1 production contributed to increased IL-6 and CXCL1 since these cytokines were profoundly reduced in the ischemic hemispheres from IL-1α/β double KO mice, although injury-induced cytokine responses were not abolished. Thus, DAMPs augment brain inflammation by directly stimulating production of glial derived inflammatory mediators. This is markedly enhanced by DAMP-induced IL-1-release-dependent responses that require a sterile endogenous priming stimulus such as SAA.

Fungi and allergic lower respiratory tract diseases.
Asthma is a common disorder that in 2009 afflicted 8.2% of adults                        and children, 24.6 million persons, in the United States. In patients with                        moderate and severe persistent asthma, there is significantly increased                        morbidity, use of health care support, and health care costs. Epidemiologic                        studies in the United States and Europe have associated mold sensitivity,                        particularly to Alternaria alternata and Cladosporium herbarum, with the                        development, persistence, and severity of asthma. In addition, sensitivity                        to Aspergillus fumigatus has been associated with severe persistent asthma                        in adults. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is caused by A                        fumigatus and is characterized by exacerbations of asthma, recurrent                        transient chest radiographic infiltrates, coughing up thick mucus plugs,                        peripheral and pulmonary eosinophilia, and increased total serum IgE and                        fungus-specific IgE levels, especially during exacerbation. The airways                        appear to be chronically or intermittently colonized by A fumigatus in                        patients with ABPA. ABPA is the most common form of allergic                        bronchopulmonary mycosis (ABPM); other fungi, including Candida,                        Penicillium, and Curvularia species, are implicated. The characteristics of                        ABPM include severe asthma, eosinophilia, markedly increased total IgE and                        specific IgE levels, bronchiectasis, and mold colonization of the airways.                        The term severe asthma associated with fungal sensitization (SAFS) has been                        coined to illustrate the high rate of fungal sensitivity in patients with                        persistent severe asthma and improvement with antifungal treatment. The                        immunopathology of ABPA, ABPM, and SAFS is incompletely understood. Genetic                        risks identified in patients with ABPA include HLA association and certain                        T(H)2-prominent and cystic fibrosis variants, but these have not been                        studied in patients with ABPM and SAFS. Oral corticosteroid and antifungal                        therapies appear to be partially successful in patients with ABPA. However,                        the role of antifungal and immunomodulating therapies in patients with ABPA,                        ABPM, and SAFS requires additional larger studies.

Objective To assess the effectiveness of enhanced communicationtherapy in the first four months after stroke compared with an attentioncontrol (unstructured social contact).Design Externally randomised, pragmatic, parallel, superiority trial withblinded outcome assessment.Setting Twelve UK hospital and community stroke services.Participants 170 adults (mean age 70 years) randomised within twoweeks of admission to hospital with stroke (December 2006 to January2010) whom speech and language therapists deemed eligible, and 135carers.Interventions Enhanced, agreed best practice, communication therapyspecific to aphasia or dysarthria, offered by speech and languagetherapists according to participants’ needs for up to four months, withcontinuity from hospital to community. Comparison was with similarlyresourced social contact (without communication therapy) from employedvisitors.Outcome measures Primary outcome was blinded, functionalcommunicative ability at six months on the Therapy Outcome Measure(TOM) activity subscale. Secondary outcomes (unblinded, six months):participants’ perceptions on the Communication Outcomes After Strokescale (COAST); carers’ perceptions of participants from part of the CarerCOAST; carers’ wellbeing on Carers of Older People in Europe Indexand quality of life items from Carer COAST; and serious adverse events.Results Therapist and visitor contact both had good uptake from serviceusers. An average 22 contacts (intervention or control) over 13 weekswere accepted by users. Impairment focused therapy was the approachmost often used by the speech and language therapists. Visitors mostoften provided general conversation. In total, 81/85 of the interventiongroup and 72/85 of the control group completed the primary outcomemeasure. Both groups improved on the TOM activity subscale. Theestimated six months group difference was not statistically significant,with 0.25 (95% CI –0.19 to 0.69) points in favour of therapy. Sensitivityanalyses that adjusted for chance baseline imbalance further reducedthis difference. Per protocol analyses rejected a possible dilution oftreatment effect from controls declining their allocation and receivingusual care. There was no added benefit of therapy on secondary outcomemeasures, subgroup analyses (such as aphasia), or serious adverseevents, although the latter were less common after intervention (oddsratio 0.42 (95% CI 0.16 to 1.1)).Conclusions Communication therapy had no added benefit beyondthat from everyday communication in the first four months after stroke.Future research should evaluate reorganised services that supportfunctional communication practice early in the stroke pathway.

Low-temperature magnetization of (Ga,Mn) As semiconductors
We report on a comprehensive study of the ferromagnetic moment per Mn atom in (Ga,Mn)As ferromagnetic semiconductors. Theoretical discussion is based on microscopic calculations and on an effective model of Mn local moments antiferromagnetically coupled to valence band hole spins. The validity of the effective model over the range of doping studied is assessed by comparing with microscopic tight-binding/coherent-potential approximation calculations. Using the virtual crystal k center dot p model for hole states, we evaluate the zero-temperature mean-field contributions to the magnetization from the hole kinetic and exchange energies, and magnetization suppression due to quantum fluctuations of Mn moment orientations around their mean-field ground state values. Experimental low-temperature ferromagnetic moments per Mn are obtained by superconducting quantum interference device and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements in a series of (Ga,Mn)As semiconductors with nominal Mn doping ranging from similar to 2 to 8%. Hall measurements in as-grown and annealed samples are used to estimate the number of uncompensated substitutional Mn moments. Based on our comparison between experiment and theory we conclude that all these Mn moments in high quality (Ga,Mn)As materials have nearly parallel ground state alignment.

Pain management for women in labour: an overview of systematic reviews.
BACKGROUND: The pain that women experience during labour is affected by multiple physiological and psychosocial factors and its intensity can vary greatly.  Most women in labour require pain relief. Pain management strategies include non-pharmacological interventions (that aim to help women cope with pain in labour) and pharmacological interventions (that aim to relieve the pain of labour). OBJECTIVES: To summarise the evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews on the efficacy and safety of non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions to manage pain in labour. We considered findings from non-Cochrane systematic reviews if there was no relevant Cochrane review. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 5), The Cochrane Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2 of 4), MEDLINE (1966 to 31 May 2011) and EMBASE (1974 to 31 May 2011) to identify all relevant systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials of pain management in labour. Each of the contributing Cochrane reviews (nine new, six updated) followed a generic protocol with 13 common primary efficacy and safety outcomes. Each Cochrane review included comparisons with placebo, standard care or with a different intervention according to a predefined hierarchy of interventions. Two review authors extracted data and assessed methodological quality, and data were checked by a third author. This overview is a narrative summary of the results obtained from individual reviews. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 15 Cochrane reviews (255 included trials) and three non-Cochrane reviews (55 included trials) for inclusion within this overview. For all interventions, with available data, results are presented as comparisons of: 1. Intervention versus placebo or standard care; 2. Different forms of the same intervention (e.g. one opioid versus another opioid); 3. One type of intervention versus a different type of intervention (e.g. TENS versus opioid). Not all reviews included results for all comparisons. Most reviews compared the intervention with placebo or standard care, but with the exception of opioids and epidural analgesia, there were few direct comparisons between different forms of the same intervention, and even fewer comparisons between different interventions. Based on these three comparisons, we have categorised interventions into: " What works" ,"What may work", and "Insufficient evidence to make a judgement".WHAT WORKSEvidence suggests that epidural, combined spinal epidural (CSE) and inhaled analgesia effectively manage pain in labour, but may give rise to adverse effects. Epidural, and inhaled analgesia effectively relieve pain when compared with placebo or a different type of intervention (epidural versus opioids). Combined-spinal epidurals relieve pain more quickly than traditional or low dose epidurals. Women receiving inhaled analgesia were more likely to experience vomiting, nausea and dizziness.When compared with placebo or opioids, women receiving epidural analgesia had more instrumental vaginal births and caesarean sections for fetal distress, although there was no difference in the rates of caesarean section overall. Women receiving epidural analgesia were more likely to experience hypotension, motor blockade, fever or urinary retention. Less urinary retention was observed in women receiving CSE than in women receiving traditional epidurals. More women receiving CSE than low-dose epidural experienced pruritus.  WHAT MAY WORKThere is some evidence to suggest that immersion in water, relaxation, acupuncture, massage and local anaesthetic nerve blocks or non-opioid drugs may improve management of labour pain, with few adverse effects.  Evidence was mainly limited to single trials. These interventions relieved pain and improved satisfaction with pain relief (immersion, relaxation, acupuncture, local anaesthetic nerve blocks, non-opioids) and childbirth experience (immersion, relaxation, non-opioids) when compared with placebo or standard care. Relaxation was associated with fewer assisted vaginal births and acupuncture was associated with fewer assisted vaginal births and caesarean sections.INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCEThere is insufficient evidence to make judgements on whether or not hypnosis, biofeedback, sterile water injection, aromatherapy, TENS, or parenteral opioids are more effective than placebo or other interventions for pain management in labour. In comparison with other opioids more women receiving pethidine experienced adverse effects including drowsiness and nausea.  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Most methods of non-pharmacological pain management are non-invasive and appear to be safe for mother and baby, however, their efficacy is unclear, due to limited high quality evidence. In many reviews, only one or two trials provided outcome data for analysis and the overall methodological quality of the trials was low. High quality trials are needed.There is more evidence to support the efficacy of pharmacological methods, but these have more adverse effects. Thus, epidural analgesia provides effective pain relief but at the cost of increased instrumental vaginal birth.It remains important to tailor methods used to each woman's wishes, needs and circumstances, such as anticipated duration of labour, the infant's condition, and any augmentation or induction of labour.A major challenge in compiling this overview, and the individual systematic reviews on which it is based, has been the variation in use of different process and outcome measures in different trials, particularly assessment of pain and its relief, and effects on the neonate after birth. This made it difficult to pool results from otherwise similar studies, and to derive conclusions from the totality of evidence. Other important outcomes have simply not been assessed in trials; thus, despite concerns for 30 years or more about the effects of maternal opioid administration during labour on subsequent neonatal behaviour and its influence on breastfeeding, only two out of 57 trials of opioids reported breastfeeding as an outcome. We therefore strongly recommend that the outcome measures, agreed through wide consultation for this project, are used in all future trials of methods of pain management.

Deletion of a regulatory gene within the cpk gene cluster reveals novel antibacterial activity in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2)
Genome sequencing of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) revealed an uncharacterized type I polyketide synthase gene cluster (cpk). Here we describe the discovery of a novel antibacterial activity (abCPK) and a yellow-pigmented secondary metabolite (yCPK) after deleting a presumed pathway-specific regulatory gene (scbR2) that encodes a member of the ??-butyrolactone receptor family of proteins and which lies in the cpk gene cluster. Overproduction of yCPK and abCPK in a scbR2 deletion mutant, and the absence of the newly described compounds from cpk deletion mutants, suggest that they are products of the previously orphan cpk biosynthetic pathway in which abCPK is converted into the yellow pigment. Transcriptional analysis suggests that scbR2 may act in a negative feedback mechanism to eventually limit yCPK biosynthesis. The results described here represent a novel approach for the discovery of new, biologically active compounds. ?? 2010 SGM.

[braf, oncogenic, ra, kinase-dead]

Kinase-dead BRAF and oncogenic RAS cooperate to drive tumor progression through CRAF.
We describe a mechanism of tumorigenesis mediated by kinase-dead BRAF in the presence of oncogenic RAS. We show that drugs that selectively inhibit BRAF drive RAS-dependent BRAF binding to CRAF, CRAF activation, and MEK-ERK signaling. This does not occur when oncogenic BRAF is inhibited, demonstrating that BRAF inhibition per se does not drive pathway activation; it only occurs when BRAF is inhibited in the presence of oncogenic RAS. Kinase-dead BRAF mimics the effects of the BRAF-selective drugs and kinase-dead Braf and oncogenic Ras cooperate to induce melanoma in mice. Our data reveal another paradigm of BRAF-mediated signaling that promotes tumor progression. They highlight the importance of understanding pathway signaling in clinical practice and of genotyping tumors prior to administering BRAF-selective drugs, to identify patients who are likely to respond and also to identify patients who may experience adverse effects.

The Role of Auger Recombination in InAs 1.3-/mu m Quantum-Dot Lasers Investigated Using High Hydrostatic Pressure
<p>InAs quantum-dot (QD) lasers were investigated in the temperature range 20-300 K and under hydrostatic pressure in the range of 0-12 kbar at room temperature. The results indicate that Auger recombination is very important in 1.3-mum QD lasers at room temperature and it is, therefore, the possible cause of the relatively low characteristic temperature observed, of T-0 = 41 K. In the 980-mn QD lasers where T-0 = 110-130 K, radiative recombination dominates. The laser emission photon energy E-las increases linearly with pressure p at 10.1 and 8.3 meV/kbar for 980 nm and 1.3-mum QD lasers, respectively. For the 980-mn QD lasers the threshold current increases with pressure at a rate proportional to the square of the photon energy E-las(2). However, la the threshold current of the 1.3-mum QD laser decreases. by 26% over a 12-kbar pressure range. This demonstrates the presence of a nonradiative recombination contribution to the threshold current, which decreases with increasing pressure. The authors show that this nonradiative contribution is Auger recombination. The results are discussed in the framework of a theoretical model based on the electronic structure and radiative recombination calculations carried out using an 8 x 8 k(.)p Hamiltonian.</p>

[scar, psychosocial, severity, distress, patient, dlqi, das24]

Skin scar preconceptions must be challenged: importance of self-perception in skin scarring.
Greater objective scar severity and visibility should intuitively cause greater psychosocial distress for patients. Previous research is contradictory and has employed non-validated scar severity measures whilst neglecting patient-rated severity. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of objective and patient-rated scar severity, scar type and location on psychosocial distress. Skin scars were quantitatively assessed on two independent occasions using the 'Manchester Scar Scale' (MSS) - a validated measure. Scars were scored twice independently. Patients also rated their scars (from 'very good' zero to 'poor' four) and good completed the Derriford Appearance Scale (DAS24) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Eighty-two patients, with an average+/-SD (range) age of 34+/-15 (16-65) years were recruited. Mean psychosocial questionnaire scores were: DAS24 45.5+/-17.8 (15-91); DLQI 7.5+/-6.7 (0-26). Participants had 1.9+/-1.5 (1-8) scars with an MSS score of 31.3+/-24.0 (6.6-162.0) and subjective score of 2.6+/-1.2 (0-4). Correlation between psychosocial distress and objective severity was not significant (DAS24 0.14 p=0.11; DLQI 0.16 p=0.06). Correlation between psychosocial distress and subjective severity was significant (DAS24 0.48 p<0.0001; DLQI 0.46 p<0.0001). Patients with non-visible scars experienced greater psychosocial distress than patients with visible scars (DAS24 9.7 p=0.046; DLQI 4.2 p=0.014). Scar type was unrelated to psychosocial distress. Patient-rated scar severity and scar visibility are correlated with psychosocial distress rather than clinician's objective severity rating or scar type. Although counter-intuitive, results are consistent with research into other disfiguring conditions and patient self-assessment should therefore form an integral part of clinical assessment.

Air temperature and glacier ablation - a parametric approach
Two aspects of the glacier-climate problem are investigated by linear regression analysis of data from White Glacier (Axel Heiberg Island) and surroundings: (1) the relationship between air temperatures over glaciers and at distant weather stations; (2) the relationship between short-term ablation and air temperature. Parameters in the two models are found to be reasonably consistent for different samples. Averaged parameters for the models are incorporated into a further model to simulate summer ablation on White Glacier for 1960-72 using summer temperatures at distant weather stations as input data. Results are tested by comparison with observed annual net balance data. Main sources of discrepancy are the effects of accumulation. Analysis of data from twelve other glaciers suggests that relationships between mass balance and temperature are reasonably consistent for different glaciers and can be interpreted in terms of results from the White Glacier.

[neuronal]

Artifact versus reality--how astrocytes contribute to synaptic events.
The neuronal doctrine, developed a century ago regards neuronal networks as the sole substrate of higher brain function. Recent advances in glial physiology have promoted an alternative hypothesis, which places information processing in the brain into integrated neuronal-glial networks utilizing both binary (neuronal action potentials) and analogue (diffusional propagation of second messengers/metabolites through gap junctions or transmitters through the interstitial space) signal encoding. It has been proposed that the feed-forward and feed-back communication between these two types of neural cells, which underlies information transfer and processing, is accomplished by the release of neurotransmitters from neuronal terminals as well as from astroglial processes. Understanding of this subject, however, remains incomplete and important questions and controversies require resolution. Here we propose that the primary function of perisynaptic glial processes is to create an "astroglial cradle" that shields the synapse from a multitude of extrasynaptic signaling events and provides for multifaceted support and long-term plasticity of synaptic contacts through variety of mechanisms, which may not necessarily involve the release of "glio" transmitters.

Antibiotic treatment for Burkholderia cepacia complex in people with cystic fibrosis experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation
BACKGROUND: Chronic pulmonary infection is one of the hallmarks of lung disease in cystic fibrosis. Infections dominated by organisms of the Burkholderia cepacia complex, a group of at least 17 closely-related species of gram-negative bacteria, are particularly difficult to treat. These infections may be associated with a fulminant necrotising pneumonia, and are greatly feared by patients. Burkholderia cepacia bacteria are innately resistant to many common antibiotics and able to acquire resistance against many more. Since strict patient segregation was introduced to cystic fibrosis medical care, the incidence of the more virulent epidemic strains has fallen, and new infections are more likely to be with environmentally-acquired strains which seem to exhibit less virulence. Nonetheless, exacerbations of respiratory symptoms require effective therapy directed against the dominant bacterial species. Although evidence-based guidelines exist for the treatment of respiratory exacerbations involving Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common chronic infection in cystic fibrosis, these cannot be directly extended to Burkholderia cepacia complex infections. The aim of this review is to assess the available trial evidence for choice and application of treatments for Burkholderia cepacia complex infections. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of different antibiotic regimens in people with cystic fibrosis experiencing an exacerbation, who are chronically infected with organisms of the Burkholderia cepacia complex. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews.Date of latest search: 29 November 2011. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of treatments for exacerbations of pulmonary symptoms in cystic fibrosis patients chronically infected with organisms of the Burkholderia cepacia complex. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: No relevant trials were identified. MAIN RESULTS: No trials were included in this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Burkholderia cepacia complex infections present a significant challenge for cystic fibrosis clinicians and patients alike. The incidence is likely to increase as the cystic fibrosis population ages and the problem of how to manage and treat these infections becomes more important. There is a lack of trial evidence to guide decision making and no conclusions can be drawn from this review about the optimal antibiotic regimens for cystic fibrosis patients with chronic Burkholderia cepacia complex infections. Clinicians must continue to assess each patient individually, taking into account in vitro antibiotic susceptibility data, previous clinical responses and their own experience. There is a clear need for multi-centre randomised clinical trials to assess the effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens in cystic fibrosis patients infected with organisms of the Burkholderia cepacia complex.

Amino acid sequence of the ligand-binding domain of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor 1 predicts sensitivity of wild birds to effects of dioxin-like compounds
The sensitivity of avian species to the toxic effects of dioxin-like compounds (DLCs) varies up to 1000-fold among species and this variability has been associated with inter-species differences in aryl hydrocarbon receptor 1 ligand binding domain (AHR1 LBD) sequence. We previously showed that LD50 values, based on in ovo exposures to DLCs, were significantly correlated with in vitro EC50 values obtained with a luciferase reporter gene (LRG) assay that measures AHR1-mediated induction of cytochrome P4501A in COS-7 cells transfected with avian AHR1 constructs. Those findings suggest that the AHR1 LBD sequence and the LRG assay can be used to predict avian species sensitivity to DLCs. In the present study, the AHR1 LBD sequences of 86 avian species were studied and differences at amino acid sites 256, 257, 297, 324, 337 and 380 were identified. Site-directed mutagenesis, the LRG assay and homology modeling highlighted the importance of each amino acid site in AHR1 sensitivity to 2,3,8,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and other DLCs. The results of the study revealed that: (1) only amino acids at sites 324 and 380 affect the sensitivity of AHR1 expression constructs of 86 avian species to DLCs and (2) in vitro luciferase activity in AHR1 constructs containing only the LBD of the species of interest is significantly correlated (r2 = 0.93, p<0.0001) with in ovo toxicity data for those species. These results indicate promise for the use of AHR1 LBD amino acid sequences independently, or combined with the LRG assay, to predict avian species sensitivity to DLCs.Author Posting. © The Author(s), 2012.

Can nurses help identify patients with depression following stroke? A pilot study using two methods of detection.
AIM: This paper reports a study to determine the accuracy of the Geriatric Mental State examination and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, when administered by a nurse, in detecting depression in patients who have recently had a stroke. BACKGROUND: After a stroke, survivors spend considerable amounts of time in the direct care of nurses. Many show signs of depression, and this has been associated with an adverse effect on recovery and rehabilitation. Identifying those with depression when they have communication and cognitive difficulties is especially difficult. Treatments are available to assist in the management of depression, and early detection and intervention may assist in this process. METHOD: A cross-sectional pilot study was conducted, comparing (a) clinical diagnosis of depression by a psychiatrist with (b) two clinical interviews, using the Geriatric Mental State examination and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, conducted by a nurse. The data were collected in 2002. FINDINGS: Twenty-eight patients, who were still in hospital in the second week poststroke, were included. The median age was 72 (interquartile range: 61-78). There were 14 males. The psychiatrist rated seven (25%) patients as depressed. The Geriatric Mental State examination had a sensitivity of 71%, a specificity of 67%, a positive predictive value of 42%, a negative predictive value of 88% in detecting depression and an overall efficiency of 68%. The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale had a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 65%, a positive predictive value of 54%, a negative predictive value of 100% and an overall efficiency of 75%. CONCLUSION: In this study, the Geriatric Mental State examination and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale were at least as efficient at detecting the depression in patients who have had a stroke. However, as the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale is quicker to administer, it may prove more useful to nurses clinically.

Genetic ablation of Cav1 differentially affects melanoma tumor growth and metastasis in mice: role of Cav1 in Shh heterotypic signaling and transendothelial migration.
Both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous factors contribute to tumor growth and metastasis of melanoma. The function of caveolin-1 (Cav1), a multifunctional scaffold protein known to modulate several biologic processes in both normal tissue and cancer, has been recently investigated in melanoma cancer cells, but its role in the melanoma microenvironment remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that orthotopic implantation of B16F10 melanoma cells in the skin of Cav1KO mice increases tumor growth, and co-injection of Cav1-deficient dermal fibroblasts with melanoma cells is sufficient to recapitulate the tumor phenotype observed in Cav1KO mice. Using indirect coculture experiments with fibroblasts and melanoma cells combined with cytokine analysis, we found that Cav1-deficient fibroblasts promoted the growth of melanoma cells via enhanced paracrine cytokine signaling. Specifically, Cav1-deficient fibroblasts displayed increased ShhN expression, which heterotypically enhanced the Shh signaling pathway in melanoma cells. In contrast to primary tumor growth, the ability of B16F10 melanoma cells to form lung metastases was significantly reduced in Cav1KO mice. This phenotype was associated mechanistically with the inability of melanoma cells to adhere to and to transmigrate through a monolayer of endothelial cells lacking Cav1. Together, our findings show that Cav1 may regulate different mechanisms during primary melanoma tumor growth and metastatic dissemination.

Assessment of circulating biomarkers for potential pharmacodynamic utility in patients with lymphoma.
PURPOSE: Treatment efficacy and toxicity are difficult to predict in lymphoma patients. In this study, the utility of circulating biomarkers in predicting and/or monitoring treatment efficacy/toxicity were investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Circulating biomarkers of cell death (nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) and cytokeratin 18 (CK18)), and circulating FLT3 ligand, a potential biomarker of myelosuppression, were assessed before and serially after standard chemotherapy in 49 patients with Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Cytokeratin 18 is not expressed in lymphoma cells so is a potential biomarker of epithelial toxicity in this setting. Tumour response was assessed before and after completion of chemotherapy by 2D and 3D computed tomography radiological response. RESULTS: Baseline nDNA level was significantly higher in all lymphoma subtypes compared with 61 healthy controls and was prognostic for progression-free survival in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Decreases in nDNA levels were observed in the first week after chemotherapy; in FL, early falls in nDNA predicted for long remission following therapy. In DLBCL, elevations in nDNA occurred in cases with progressive disease. Circulating CK18 increased within 48 h of chemotherapy and was significantly higher in patients experiencing epithelial toxicity graded >3 by Common Terminology for Classification of Adverse Events criteria. FLT3 ligand was elevated within 3-8 days of chemotherapy initiation and predicted those patients who subsequently developed neutropenic sepsis. CONCLUSION: These data suggest circulating biomarkers contribute useful information regarding tumour response and toxicity in patients receiving standard chemotherapy and have potential utility in the development of individualised treatment approaches in lymphoma. These biomarkers are now being tested within multicentre phase III trials to progress their qualification.

Commercializing Biomedical Research Through Securitization Techniques
Biomedical innovation has become riskier, more expensive and more difficult to finance with traditional sources such as private and public equity. Here we propose a financial structure in which a large number of biomedical programs at various stages of development are funded by a single entity to substantially reduce the portfolio's risk. The portfolio entity can finance its activities by issuing debt, a critical advantage because a much larger pool of capital is available for investment in debt versus equity. By employing financial engineering techniques such as securitization, it can raise even greater amounts of more-patient capital. In a simulation using historical data for new molecular entities in oncology from 1990 to 2011, we find that megafunds of $5–15 billion may yield average investment returns of 8.9–11.4% for equity holders and 5–8% for 'research-backed obligation' holders, which are lower than typical venture-capital hurdle rates but attractive to pension funds, insurance companies and other large institutional investors.

Ependymoma in children: surgical treatment, technological advances and outcomes over a 55-year period in North West EnglandObjective: Surgical resection has always been the mainstay management for childhood ependymoma, with the use of adjuvant therapies advocated according to patient age. We aimed to evaluate the influence of new technologies and the re-organisation of paediatric neurosurgical services on survival outcomes.Study design: The patient list and tumour type was obtained from the North West Tumour Registry between January 1954 and December 2008. The patient’s case notes were retrospectively analysed. Subgroup univariate and multivariate analysis was performed for time period, extent of resection, location and age. Survival between subgroups was tested for significance using the log-rank test. Demographics: 129 patients were obtained from the registry with a histological diagnosis of ependymoma. The age ranged from 3.5 months to 182.5 months (15 years) with a mean age at presentation of 5.5years. The male to female ratio was 0.9:1.Results:Patients were stratified into five 11-year time periods from 1954 – 2008 according to their date of diagnosis. 5-year overall survival improved significantly from 20% to 71% for children diagnosed between 1954-1964 and 1998-2008 respectively. 5-year progression free survival also improved significantly, this was most pronounced for the latter time periods. This trend was also mirrored by the gross total resection rate which for the latter time periods increased substantially from 20% to 57%.Conclusion:We advocate that the introduction of new surgical technologies and amalgamation on paediatric neurosurgical services in North West England has led to improvements in ependymoma gross total resection rates and PFS.

Examining the Role of Carbonation and Temperature on Water Swallowing Performance: A Swallowing Reaction-Time Study.
Various therapeutic approaches for dysphagia management are based on modifications of bolus properties to change swallowing biomechanics and increase swallowing safety. Limited evidence exists for the effects of carbonation and bolus temperature on swallowing behavior. Here, we investigated the effects of carbonation and temperature on swallowing behavior using a novel automated and complex swallowing reaction time task via pressure signal recordings in the hypopharynx. Healthy participants (n = 39, 27.7±5 years old) were randomized in two different experiments and asked to perform 10 normal-paced swallows, 10 fast-paced swallows, and 10 challenged swallows within a predetermined time-window of carbonated versus still water (experiment 1) and of cold (4 °C) versus hot (45 °C) versus room temperature (21 °C) water (experiment 2). Quantitative measurements of latencies and percentage of successful challenged swallows were collected and analyzed nonparametrically. An increase in successfully performed challenged swallowing task was observed with carbonated water versus still water (P = 0.021), whereas only cold water shortened the latencies of normally paced swallows compared with room (P = 0.001) and hot (P = 0.004) temperatures. Therefore, it appears that chemothermal stimulation with carbonation and cold are most effective at modulating water swallowing, which in part is likely to be driven by central swallowing afferent activity.

How often do you wash your hair?  design as disordering:  everyday routines, human object theories, probes and sustainablity
<p>New objects can create disorder in our lives particularly when we try to appropriate and make sense of newly developed products that do not fit our routines. Ultimately, through exploring objects' affordances, our relationship to them develops into a routinised practice we no longer reflect on them. Hair care is universal and (often) an ‘ordinary’ part of our daily routines. Our cleanliness routines consume resources and therefore are implicated in the issue of environmental sustainability. However, routines are complex and
difficult to change when they are set in a culture of individual consumer choice. The disorder inherent in the process of appropriation raises the possibility that design might deliberately create a useful ‘disorder’ in routinised practices to facilitate sustainable strategies in everyday life.
  The paper proposes an approach of investigating routinised practices in relation to deliberately creating disorder in everyday routines and practice theory. Further, it outlines a pilot study that uses the designled method of 'probes' and considers its potentials in generating disorder. It identifies creative disorder in the process of designers developing the probes, participants interacting with them to finally designers receiving the results. Thinking about the process in terms of disorder is seen to be valuable in facilitating, applying and
developing probes, not only to inspire the designer but also to sensitise the designer to private and intimate areas of everyday life such as hair care.</p>

Apex peptide elution chain selection: A new strategy for selecting precursors in 2D-LC-MALDI-TOF/TOF experiments on complex biological samples
{LC-MALDI} provides an often overlooked opportunity to exploit the separation between {LC-MS} and {MS/MS} stages of a {2D-LC-MS-based} proteomics experiment, that is, by making a smarter selection for precursor fragmentation. Apex Peptide Elution Chain Selection {(APECS)} is a simple and powerful method for intensity-based peptide selection in a complex sample separated by {2D-LC}, using a {MALDI-TOF/TOF} instrument. It removes the peptide redundancy present in the adjacent first-dimension (typically strong cation exchange, {SCX)} fractions by constructing peptide elution profiles that link the precursor ions of the same peptide across {SCX} fractions. Subsequently, the precursor ion most likely to fragment successfully in a given profile is selected for fragmentation analysis, selecting on precursor intensity and absence of adjacent ions that may cofragment. To make the method independent of experiment-specific tolerance criteria, we introduce the concept of the branching factor, which measures the likelihood of false clustering of precursor ions based on past experiments. By validation with a complex proteome sample of Arabidopsis thaliana, {APECS} identified an equivalent number of peptides as a conventional data-dependent acquisition method but with a 35\% smaller work load. Consequently, reduced sample depletion allowed further selection of lower signal-to-noise ratio precursor ions, leading to a larger number of identified unique peptides. ?? 2010 American Chemical Society.

Single-agent lenalidomide in relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma: results from a UK phase II study suggest activity and possible gender differences.
We present data from a phase II study investigating a novel treatment strategy for relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Twenty-six patients received lenalidomide 25 mg/d (days 1-21 of a 28-d cycle) for up to 6 cycles followed by low-dose maintenance lenalidomide (15 mg) in responding patients. Eight patients achieved complete or partial response to give an overall response rate of 31% with median response duration of 22·2 months 95% confidence interval (CI) 0·0-53·6 and median progression-free survival (PFS) of 3·9 months (95% CI 0·0-11·1). An additional six patients (23%) achieved stable disease. Eleven patients received maintenance with median PFS of 14·6 months (95% CI 7·3-21·9). Correlative studies showed that peripheral T and Natural Killer (NK) cells increased in responding patients by 40-60% over the first 6 cycles with an initial dip in NK cells suggestive of tumour infiltration. Peripheral regulatory T cells were increased in MCL patients (P = 0·001) and expanded further following lenalidomide. Sequential plasma analysis showed increased IL12 p40 and IL7 alongside decreased MMP9, IL10, and adiponectin. Finally, a significant correlation (P = 0·02) between gender and response suggested that female MCL patients were more sensitive to lenalidomide than males. In summary, we confirm the activity, safety and immunomodulatory properties of lenalidomide in MCL and highlight its potential as a low-dose maintenance agent.

Angular momentum orientation at bandcrossings in rotating nuclei
Relative rotational E2 transition strengths are examined at bandcrossings, throughout the A approximate to 170 region of well-deformed nuclei. It is inferred that for the crossing band (s band) the angular momentum projection on the nuclear symmetry axis follows closely the maximum value for the two singly occupied i(13/2) neutron orbitals adjacent to the Fermi surface. The method provides direct information from the experimental data about the orientation of the angular momentum vector relative to the intrinsic nuclear symmetry axis.

Magnetic properties of graphene
Graphene – a monolayer of carbon atoms densely packed in a honeycomb lattice – was isolated for the first time in 2004 and, since then, has established itself as one of the most remarkable materials available to condensed matter scientists today. Theory predicts a whole spectrum of magnetic phenomena in graphene, including several mechanisms for intrinsic ferromagnetism and spin-ordering effects that arise due to its low-dimensionality and highly unusual electronic properties (e.g. Dirac-like spectrum). In this experimental work, SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) magnetic measurements have been carried out in graphene laminates with masses up to ≈ mg obtained by ultrasonic exfoliation of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) in N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction experiments revealed that the laminates are made of decoupled graphene crystallites with typical flake size below 50 nm. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements carried out for graphene suspensions dispersed onto a SiO2 substrate allowed the recognition of thin crystallites associable to single and double-layer graphene. X-ray dispersive fluorescence (XRF) and electron dispersive diffraction (EDX) confirmed the laminates chemical purity with absence of metals and/or magnetic inclusions. Pristine laminates exhibit Curie paramagnetism noticeable below ≈ 50 K, which contributes to about one moment per crystallite at 2 K. The laminates are strongly diamagnetic, although a decrease of the diamagnetic susceptibility by about three times with respect to graphite was observed for fields applied perpendicularly to the ab plane. The same graphene laminates were employed as a reference system to study magnetism of point defects, such as fluorine adatoms and vacancies generated through ion irradiation. The unambiguous spin value J=1/2 found for both species of defects confirms theoretical expectations. In the case of fluorine atoms a magnetic moment of 1 µB  per ≈ 1000 adatoms was obtained, associated to the tendency of fluorine to cluster in graphene. Vacancies produced a value of the magnetic moment much closer to the expected 1 µB for point defects. No sign of defect related ferromagnetism was observed. On the other hand, our study performed on NT-MTD HOPG crystals (the same adopted for the fabrication of our graphene laminates), revealed ferromagnetic signals up to 3∙10-3 emu/g. Backscattering electron microscopy (BSE), performed alongside EDX chemical analysis, confirmed that the observed magnetic behaviour is due to ferromagnetic inclusions, such as magnetite and titano-magnetite. Therefore, weak and poorly reproducible ferromagnetic-like signals in graphene laminates were attributed to the same contaminations present in the original material (i.e. HOPG).

Valgus malalignment is a risk factor for lateral knee osteoarthritis incidence and progression: Findings from MOST and the osteoarthritis initiative.
OBJECTIVE: We studied the effect of valgus malalignment on knee osteoarthritis (OA) incidence and progression. METHODS: We measured mechanical axis from long limb radiographs from the MOST Study and the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) to define valgus limbs (>1° valgus) and examined the effect of valgus vs. neutral (neither varus nor valgus) on OA structural outcomes. Posteroanterior x-rays and knee MRIs were obtained in subjects at the time of the long limb x-ray and at follow-up examinations. Lateral progression was defined by an increase in joint space narrowing (on a semiquantitative scale) and incidence as new lateral narrowing in knees without x-ray OA. We defined lateral cartilage damage and progressive meniscal damage when WORMS (MOST) or BLOKS (OAI) scores for cartilage or meniscus increased at follow-up. We used logistic regression with adjustment for age, sex, BMI and Kellgren and Lawrence grade and used GEE to evaluate the effect of valgus vs. neutral alignment on disease outcomes. RESULTS: We studied 5046 knees (881 valgus) from MOST and 5953 knees (1235 valgus) from OAI. In both studies, all strata of valgus malalignment including 1.1 to 3° valgus were associated with an increased risk of lateral disease progression. In knees without radiographic OA, valgus alignment above 3° was associated with incidence (for example in MOST, adjOR = 2.7 (95% 1.1, 6.8)). Valgus 3° or more was also associated with cartilage damage on MRI in knees without OA (for example in OAI, adjOR = 5.9 (95% CI, 1.3, 30.3)). We found a strong relation of valgus with progressive lateral meniscal damage. CONCLUSIONS: Valgus malalignment increases the risk of knee OA x-ray progression, incidence and of lateral cartilage damage. It may cause these effects, in part, by increasing the risk of meniscal damage. © 2012 American College of Rheumatology.

The decomposition of organic matter in soils by fungi
Macromolecular structures, such as lignin and cellulose, are important components ofsoil organic carbon, the major terrestrial global carbon pool. The degradation of thesemacromolecules, including lignin and cellulose, in plant-derived soil organic matter, isimportant to the global carbon cycle. In grasslands, saprotrophic (decomposer) fungi aremajor decomposers of such organic material.Some of these compounds, such as lignin are relatively resistant to decay by themicrobial community if compared with other compound classes such as cellulose.In this work we investigate the involvement of fungi in the decomposition of both ligninand cellulose and look to link the decomposition processes observed in the field to thoseobserved in a laboratory-controlled environment.The key findings of this work are:-Field based experiments in both tropical and temperate environments indicatedthat lignin can be degraded completely, most likely by white-rot fungi, as shownby the shifts in the Ac/AlS, Ac/AlG and S/G relative lignin decompositionstate proxies. The results confirm that even in a very low carbon environment,fungi are able to completely degrade lignin over time. However, lignin isdegraded much faster in tropical environments.-Culturing experiments showed that it was possible to isolate a number of fungipresent on the degraded wheat straw collected in the field., especially soft-rotfungi .When used in microcosm experiments using a range of organic substrates,the relative lignin decomposition state proxies indicated that Absidiacylindrospora and Trichoderma koningii are not able to completely degradelignin but preferentially degrade cellulose.-Cellulose degradation rates are much higher than those of lignin in degradedfield samples over time, confirming previous work.

[slow, dynamics, nucleation, microscopic]

Nucleation in the presence of slow microscopic dynamics
<p>Nucleation of a new thermodynamic phase is often a slow process due to the need to overcome a high free-energy barrier. However, there are other sources of slow dynamics; for example, at high densities/low temperatures, the movement of individual molecules or spins may be slow. Here, we study nucleation in a simple phenomenological model that has this type of slow microscopic dynamics. We do this to better understand how the two sources of slow dynamics interact. We find that as nucleation is intrinsically slow, only very slow microscopic dynamics strongly affect how nucleation occurs. The composition of the nucleus at the top of the nucleation barrier is much less sensitive to slow microscopic dynamics than is the composition of the nucleus once it is postcritical. However, slow dynamics affects not only the rate but also the pathway, which no longer goes over the saddle point in the free energy. We also find that the slow microscopic dynamics can cause sampling problems in an algorithm developed to calculate nucleation rates, and so cause it to predict the rate incorrectly.</p>

Trends in national suicide rates for Scotland and for England & Wales, 1960-2008.
BACKGROUND: Suicide rates in Scotland have increased markedly relative to those in England in recent decades. AIMS: To compare changing patterns of suicide risk in Scotland with those in England & Wales, 1960-2008. METHOD: For Scotland and for England & Wales separately, we obtained national data on suicide counts and population estimates. Gender-specific, directly age-standardised rates were calculated. RESULTS: We identified three distinct temporal phases: 1960-1967, when suicide rates in England & Wales were initially higher than in Scotland, but then converged; 1968-1991, when male suicide rates in Scotland rose slightly faster than in England & Wales; and 1992-2008, when there was a marked divergence in national trends. Much of the recent divergence in rates is attributable to the rise in suicide among young men and deaths by hanging in Scotland. Introduction of the 'undetermined intent' category in 1968 had a significant impact on suicide statistics across Great Britain, but especially so in Scotland. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in temporal patterns in suicide risk between the countries are complex. Reversal of the divergent trends may require a change in the perception of hanging as a 'painless' method of suicide.

Changing patterns and trends in systemic fungal infections.
Invasive mycoses are a significant and growing public health problem. Although bloodstream infections with Candida albicans may be decreasing in frequency, the number of persons at risk for them continues to grow. Moreover, infections with other Candida species, such as Candida glabrata, are increasing in incidence. Invasive mould infections in general, and Aspergillus infections in particular, are becoming more frequent. Fungal opportunistic infections in persons with AIDS are no longer a major problem in developed countries, but are resulting in significant morbidity and mortality in developing countries with AIDS epidemics. Further studies are needed to define populations at very high risk for fungal opportunistic infections who might benefit from targeted antifungal chemoprophylaxis, which remains the most promising of the potential prevention strategies. This review highlights the changing patterns in risk factors, changes in epidemiology, the impact of changes in medical practice in intensive care and organ transplantation on the incidence of systemic fungal infections, and gives an overview of fungal infections in paediatric patients, patients with haematological malignancy, and the emergence of antifungal resistance.

Addition of novel degenerate electrical waveform stimulation with photodynamic therapy significantly enhances its cytotoxic effect in keloid fibroblasts: first report of a potential combination therapy.
BACKGROUND: We recently reported use of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for treating keloid disease (KD). However, in view of high recurrence rates post any treatment modality, adjuvant therapies should be considered. Additionally, we previously demonstrated the effect of a novel electrical waveform, the degenerate wave (DW) on differential gene expression in keloid fibroblasts. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we evaluated the in vitro cytotoxic effect of PDT at 5J/cm(2) and 10J/cm(2) of red light (633 ± 3nm) using 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) with and without DW, on keloid fibroblasts compared to normal skin fibroblasts. METHODS: The rate of intracellular photosensitizer (protoporphyrin IX, PPIX) generation and disintegration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, LDH cytotoxicity, WST-1 cytoproliferation, apoptosis by Caspase-3 activation, mitochondrial membrane potential assessment by JC-1 aggregates, qRT-PCR, flow cytometry and In-Cell Western Blotting were performed. RESULTS: PPIX accumulation and disintegration rate was higher in keloid than normal fibroblasts after incubation with MAL compared to ALA. Increased cytotoxicity and decreased cytoproliferation were observed for keloid fibroblasts after PDT+DW treatment compared to PDT alone. ROS generation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, apoptosis (Caspase-3 activation) and collagens I and III gene down-regulation were higher in keloid compared to normal skin fibroblasts after MAL-PDT+DW treatment. An increase in the number of cells entering apoptosis and necrosis was observed after PDT+DW treatment by flow cytometry analysis. All positive findings were statistically significant (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The cytotoxic effect of PDT on keloid fibroblasts can be enhanced significantly with addition of DW stimulation, indicating for the first time the utility of this potential combinational therapy.

The research examined the contributions of youth associations towards community development in Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna State. A convenience selection of 14 registered youth associations was used in the research which comes from the 14 districts of Igabi Local Government Area and ten respondents were randomly sampled from each of the districts, making a total of 140 respondents constituting the sample size of the study. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data obtained from the questionnaire administered. The research found out that the youth associations helped in the improvement of standard of living of the people in the study area. The study also revealed that the youth associations contributed in political awareness, construction of drainages and culverts and also mobilizes people on the importance of community efforts. The major constraints faced by the youth associations included financial problem and lack of full participation by members. It was recommended that fund raising committees should be created by the youth associations and government should provide assistance to the youth association members as motivation and encouragement measures. &nbsp; KEYWORDS: Contribution; Youth association; community development; Igabi Local Government; Kaduna State.

RCN4GSC Workshop Report : managing data at the interface of biodiversity and (meta)genomics, March 2011
Building on the planning efforts of the RCN4GSC project, a workshop was convened in San Diego to bring together experts from genomics and metagenomics, biodiversity, ecology, and bioinformatics with the charge to identify potential for positive interactions and progress, especially building on successes at establishing data standards by the GSC and by the biodiversity and ecological communities. Until recently, the contribution of microbial life to the biomass and biodiversity of the biosphere was largely overlooked (because it was resistant to systematic study). Now, emerging genomic and metagenomic tools are making investigation possible. Initial research findings suggest that major advances are in the offing. Although different research communities share some overlapping concepts and traditions, they differ significantly in sampling approaches, vocabularies and workflows. Likewise, their definitions of ‘fitness for use’ for data differ significantly, as this concept stems from the specific research questions of most importance in the different fields. Nevertheless, there is little doubt that there is much to be gained from greater coordination and integration. As a first step toward interoperability of the information systems used by the different communities, participants agreed to conduct a case study on two of the leading data standards from the two formerly disparate fields: (a) GSC’s standard checklists for genomics and metagenomics and (b) TDWG’s Darwin Core standard, used primarily in taxonomy and systematic biology.© The Author(s),  2012.

The impact of negative selection on thymocyte migration in the medulla
Developing thymocytes are screened for self-reactivity before they exit the thymus, but how thymocytes scan the medulla for self antigens is unclear. Using two-photon microscopy, we observed that medullary thymocytes migrated rapidly and made frequent, transient contacts with dendritic cells. In the presence of a negative selecting ligand, thymocytes slowed, became confined to areas of approximately 30 mum in diameter and had increased contact with dendritic cells surrounding confinement zones. One third of polyclonal medullary thymocytes also showed confined, slower migration and may correspond to autoreactive thymocytes. Our data suggest that many autoreactive thymocytes do not undergo immediate arrest and death after encountering a negative selecting ligand but instead adopt an altered migration program while remaining in the medullary microenvironment.

Aims: Pain and other physical symptoms remain prevalent inthe palliative care population, and outcomes are not alwaysoptimal. Assessment, monitoring, medicines management,evaluation and collaboration are key nursing roles that mayhave a positive impact. Whether and how nurses enact theseroles is not well understood. This study aimed to investigatethe role of the community nurse in palliative care provision,with a particular focus on observational exploration of theirrole and practice in providing patient care.Methods: A longitudinal qualitative ethnographic design,comprising observation of community nurse/palliative carepatient/carer encounters over time, and post observationinterviews with patients, carers and nurses. Patients weresampled from 12 community team caseloads across threeprimary care organisations. Observations and interviewswere audio-recorded and transcribed. Iterative data analysiscomprised familiarisation, coding and categorisation usingtechniques of constant comparison to generate typologiesof concepts. The study received all necessary ethics andgovernance approvals.Results: 17 nurse/patient encounters were observed (n=11 patients, 8 nurses) with 23 post observation interviews(11 nurse, 12 patient/carer). The discussion of physicalsymptoms, especially pain, formed the core of eachobserved encounter. Nurses primarily focused on medicinesmanagement (dose, frequency, suitability), other approachesto symptom management were infrequent. Nurses wereskilled at using informal conversational assessment styles,but the non-use of formal assessment tools could narrowthe range of issues assessed. Nurses discussed the complexinterplay between physical, psychological and socialsymptoms, but this was not always reflected in care.Conclusion: Symptom management is integral tocommunity nurses work, but there is scope to improve theway this is conducted which could have a positive impacton patient outcomes.

STAT-1 facilitates the ATM activated checkpoint pathway following DNA damage.
STAT-1 plays a role in mediating stress responses to various stimuli and has also been implied to be a tumour suppressor. Here, we report that STAT-1-deficient cells have defects both in intra-S-phase and G2-M checkpoints in response to DNA damage. Interestingly, STAT-1-deficient cells showed reduced Chk2 phosphorylation on threonine 68 (Chk2(-T68)) following DNA damage, suggesting that STAT-1 might function in the ATM-Chk2 pathway. Moreover, the defects in Chk2(-T68) phosphorylation in STAT-1-deficient cells also correlated with reduced degradation of Cdc25A compared with STAT-1-expressing cells after DNA damage. We also show that STAT-1 is required for ATM-dependent phosphorylation of NBS1 and p53 but not for BRCA1 or H2AX phosphorylation following DNA damage. Expression levels of BRCT mediator/adaptor proteins MDC1 and 53BP1, which are required for ATM-mediated pathways, are reduced in cells lacking STAT-1. Enforced expression of MDC1 into STAT-1-deficient cells restored ATM-mediated phosphorylation of downstream substrates. These results imply that STAT-1 plays a crucial role in the DNA-damage-response by regulating the expression of 53BP1 and MDC1, factors known to be important for mediating ATM-dependent checkpoint pathways.

Pulmonary arterial enlargement and acute exacerbations of COPD.
BACKGROUND: Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associated with accelerated loss of lung function and death. Identification of patients at risk for these events, particularly those requiring hospitalization, is of major importance. Severe pulmonary hypertension is an important complication of advanced COPD and predicts acute exacerbations, though pulmonary vascular abnormalities also occur early in the course of the disease. We hypothesized that a computed tomographic (CT) metric of pulmonary vascular disease (pulmonary artery enlargement, as determined by a ratio of the diameter of the pulmonary artery to the diameter of the aorta PA:A ratio of >1) would be associated with severe COPD exacerbations. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, observational trial that enrolled current and former smokers with COPD. We determined the association between a PA:A ratio of more than 1 and a history at enrollment of severe exacerbations requiring hospitalization and then examined the usefulness of the ratio as a predictor of these events in a longitudinal follow-up of this cohort, as well as in an external validation cohort. We used logistic-regression and zero-inflated negative binomial regression analyses and adjusted for known risk factors for exacerbation. RESULTS: Multivariate logistic-regression analysis showed a significant association between a PA:A ratio of more than 1 and a history of severe exacerbations at the time of enrollment in the trial (odds ratio, 4.78; 95% confidence interval CI, 3.43 to 6.65; P<0.001). A PA:A ratio of more than 1 was also independently associated with an increased risk of future severe exacerbations in both the trial cohort (odds ratio, 3.44; 95% CI, 2.78 to 4.25; P<0.001) and the external validation cohort (odds ratio, 2.80; 95% CI, 2.11 to 3.71; P<0.001). In both cohorts, among all the variables analyzed, a PA:A ratio of more than 1 had the strongest association with severe exacerbations. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary artery enlargement (a PA:A ratio of >1), as detected by CT, was associated with severe exacerbations of COPD.

Experience of hypoglycaemia is associated with changes in beliefs about diabetes in patients with type 2 diabetes.
AIM: Hypoglycaemia may have a detrimental impact on quality of life for patients with Type 2 diabetes. There are few clinical studies exploring the impact of experiencing hypoglycaemia on beliefs about diabetes and health status. The aim of this study was to explore associations between experience of hypoglycaemia and changes in diabetes beliefs and self-reported health status in patients with non-insulin-treated Type 2 diabetes using a blood glucose meter. METHODS: One-year prospective cohort analysis of 226 patients recruited to a randomized trial evaluating the impact of self-monitoring of blood glucose. Self-reported hypoglycaemia over 1 year was categorized into three groups: (1) no experience of hypoglycaemia; (2) blood glucose measurements < 4 mmol/l with no associated symptoms of hypoglycaemia (grade 1); and (3) symptomatic hypoglycaemia (grade 2 and 3). Measures of beliefs about diabetes (Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire) and health status (EuroQol-5D) were assessed at baseline and 1 year. Differences in mean changes over 1 year were explored with analyses of covariance. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in mean score in beliefs about personal control (1.14; 95%CI 0.14-2.14) among those experiencing grade 1 hypoglycaemia compared with those not experiencing hypoglycaemia. There were no significant differences in changes in health status between groups, with small overall changes that were inconsistent between groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study does not provide support for a long-term adverse impact on beliefs about diabetes or health status from the experience of mild symptomatic hypoglycaemia, in well-controlled, non-insulin-treated patients with Type 2 diabetes using self-monitoring of blood glucose.

Erythropoiesis in Hairy Cell Leukemia: a True Erythroid Failure
A quantitative evaluation of erythropoiesis was carried out in 12 patients with hairy cell leukaemia (HCL). The results were compared with those obtained in eight patients with aplastic anaemia (AA) in order to define the characteristics of erythroid failure in HCL. Discriminant analysis was applied to both haematological and erythrokinetic parameters of the two disease groups. Plasma iron concentration and MCV were significantly higher in AA, and allowed a perfect separation of the patients. As regards erythrokinetics, values of ineffective erythropoiesis and peripheral haemolysis were able to separate completely the two disease groups, being significantly lower in HCL than in AA. A true erythroid failure was the peculiar erythrokinetic pattern of HCL. This conclusion allows one to speculate on the nature of the stem cell damage in this disease.

The cellular biology of flexor tendon adhesion formation: an old problem in a new paradigm.
Intrasynovial flexor tendon injuries of the hand can frequently be complicated by tendon adhesions to the surrounding sheath, limiting finger function. We have developed a new tendon injury model in the mouse to investigate the three-dimensional cellular biology of intrasynovial flexor tendon healing and adhesion formation. We investigated the cell biology using markers for inflammation, proliferation, collagen synthesis, apoptosis, and vascularization/myofibroblasts. Quantitative immunohistochemical image analysis and three-dimensional reconstruction with cell mapping was performed on labeled serial sections. Flexor tendon adhesions were also assessed 21 days after wounding using transmission electron microscopy to examine the cell phenotypes in the wound. When the tendon has been immobilized, the mouse can form tendon adhesions in the flexor tendon sheath. The cell biology of tendon healing follows the classic wound healing response of inflammation, proliferation, synthesis, and apoptosis, but the greater activity occurs in the surrounding tissue. Cells that have multiple "fibripositors" and cells with cytoplasmic protrusions that contain multiple large and small diameter fibrils can be found in the wound during collagen synthesis. In conclusion, adhesion formation occurs due to scarring between two damaged surfaces. The mouse model for flexor tendon injury represents a new platform to study adhesion formation that is genetically tractable.

Research into literacy and technology in primary classrooms: an exploration of understandings generated by recent studies
Whilst much has been written about the implications for ‘literacy’ for practices surrounding digital technologies (Gee, 2000a; Luke and Carrington, 2002; Snyder, 1998), there has been surprisingly little research investigating new literacies in primary classrooms (Andrews, 2003; Labbo and Reinking, 2003: Lankshear and Knobel, 2003). This review examines the kinds of understandings that have been generated through studies of primary literacy and technology reported during the period 2000-2006. It uses Green’s distinction between ‘operational’, ‘cultural’ and ‘critical’ dimensions of primary literacy (Lankshear and Bigum, 1999; Snyder, 2001) to investigate the focus and methodology of 38 empirical studies. It explores ways in which research may be informed by assumptions and practices associated with print literacy, but also highlights the kinds of studies which are beginning to investigate the implications of digital texts for primary education. The paper concludes by arguing for further ethnographic and phenomenological studies of classroom literacy practices in order to explore the complex contexts which surround and are mediated by digital texts.

Microstructure analyses of metal-filled carbon nanotubes synthesized by microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition
<p>Pd/Co-based metal-filled carbon nanotubes (MF-CNTs) were synthesized by a microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition method using a bias-enhanced growth technique. Pd/Co-based MF-CNTs were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), and Raman spectroscopy. MF-CNTs were well-aligned and uniform in size on a Si substrate. Both multiwall nanotube carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and herringbone (or stacked cups structure) structures were observed. High-resolution TEM revealed that MF-CNTs were composed of highly ordered graphite layers, and the elemental maps of EELS indicate that both Co and Pd metals are present inside the nanotubes. TEM results clearly showed that both Pd and Co metals were successfully encapsulated into the CNTs. We observed a low value for the Raman intensity ratio between D (1355 cm(-1)) and G (1590 cm(-1)) bands with no shift of the G-peak position and no broadening of the G-peak, indicative of high-quality Pd/Co-based MF-CNTs. Based on TEM characterization, we propose a description for the encapsulating mechanisms.</p>

Molecular profiling of a lethal tumor microenvironment, as defined by stromal caveolin-1 status in breast cancers.
Breast cancer progression and metastasis are driven by complex and reciprocal interactions, between epithelial cancer cells and their surrounding stromal microenvironment. We have previously shown that a loss of stromal Cav-1 expression is associated with an increased risk of early tumor recurrence, metastasis and decreased overall survival. To identify and characterize the signaling pathways that are activated in Cav-1 negative tumor stroma, we performed gene expression profiling using laser microdissected breast cancer-associated stroma. Tumor stroma was laser capture microdissected from 4 cases showing high stromal Cav-1 expression and 7 cases with loss of stromal Cav-1. Briefly, we identified 238 gene transcripts that were upregulated and 232 gene transcripts that were downregulated in the stroma of tumors showing a loss of Cav-1 expression (p ≤ 0.01 and fold-change ≥ 1.5). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed "stemness," inflammation, DNA damage, aging, oxidative stress, hypoxia, autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction in the tumor stroma of patients lacking stromal Cav-1. Our findings are consistent with the recently proposed "Reverse Warburg Effect" and the "Autophagic Tumor Stroma Model of Cancer Metabolism." In these two complementary models, cancer cells induce oxidative stress in adjacent stromal cells, which then forces these stromal fibroblasts to undergo autophagy/mitophagy and aerobic glycolysis. This, in turn, produces recycled nutrients (lactate, ketones and glutamine) to feed anabolic cancer cells, which are undergoing oxidative mitochondrial metabolism. Our results are also consistent with previous biomarker studies showing that the increased expression of known autophagy markers (such as ATG16L and the cathepsins) in the tumor stroma is specifically associated with metastatic tumor progression and/or poor clinical outcome.

Deployment of titanium thermal barrier for low-temperature carbon nanotube growth
<p>Chemical vapor-synthesized carbon nanotubes are typically grown at temperatures around 600 degrees C. We report on the deployment of a titanium layer to help elevate the constraints on the substrate temperature during plasma-assisted growth. The growth is possible through the lowering of the hydrocarbon content used in the deposition, with the only source of heat provided by the plasma. The nanotubes synthesized have a small diameter distribution, which deviates from the usual trend that the diameter is determined by the thickness of the catalyst film. Simple thermodynamic simulations also show that the quantity of heat, that can be distributed, is determined by the thickness of the titanium layer. Despite the lower synthesis temperature, it is shown that this technique allows for high growth rates as well as better quality nanotubes.</p>

Performance of the quantum adiabatic algorithm on random instances of two optimization problems on regular hypergraphs
In this paper we study the performance of the quantum adiabatic algorithm on random instances of two combinatorial optimization problems, 3-regular 3-XORSAT and 3-regular max-cut. The cost functions associated with these two clause-based optimization problems are similar as they are both defined on 3-regular hypergraphs. For 3-regular 3-XORSAT the clauses contain three variables and for 3-regular max-cut the clauses contain two variables. The quantum adiabatic algorithms we study for these two problems use interpolating Hamiltonians which are amenable to sign-problem free quantum Monte Carlo and quantum cavity methods. Using these techniques we find that the quantum adiabatic algorithm fails to solve either of these problems efficiently, although for different reasons.

Combined Tandem Mass Spectrometry and Ion Mobility Spectrometry in Proteome Analyses
Proteomic studies aim to identify, quantify and characterise the full complement of proteins in a cell or organism under a defined set of conditions, and are important to our understanding of cellular mechanisms. However, such studies represent a major analytical challenge. A typical proteome analysis involves enzyme-mediated digestion of complex protein mixtures to yield an even more complex mixture of peptides. Combined reverse-phase liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry is then traditionally utilised to ascertain sequence information from the characteristic peptide sequences. Analytical data derived for the peptides are employed as search terms in database searching of protein sequences derived from gene sequences. The extreme complexity of the peptide mixtures analysed means that additional novel approaches are required to fully interrogate the vast number of tandem mass spectra generated, assigning peptide identity and thereby helping to address demanding biological questions. The research reported here aims to further our understanding of both gas phase peptide/peptide fragment ion structure and peptide fragmentation behaviour using a combination of tandem mass spectrometry and ion mobility measurement.To facilitate the determination of peptide ion collision cross section, a novel standard, QCAL-IM, produced using the QconCAT strategy, has been developed to enable calibration of drift time in Travelling Wave Ion Mobility instruments. The standard facilitates empirical determination of the rotationally averaged collision cross section of any peptide/peptide fragment ion that lies within the calibration range encompassed. QCAL-IM was subsequently utilised to determine the collision cross section of a range of peptide ions produced by Lys-C and Lys-N proteolysis of ‘standard’ proteins. Data produced allowed the effect upon gas phase ion conformation through changing the location of the basic residue lysine within a peptide sequence to be assessed.The fragmentation behaviour of peptide ions produced by a variety of digestion regimes during both collision-induced dissociation (CID) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD) has also been extensively studied. The proteases trypsin and Lys-C are those typically utilised during proteomic studies and peptides produced by each have either the basic residues arginine or lysine at their carboxy-terminus. Secondary enzymatic treatment with the exoprotease carboxypeptidase B cleaves these basic residues from the C-terminus. Tandem mass spectrometric analysis of both tryptic/Lys-C peptides and their CBPB truncated analogue highlights that the dominant fragment ion series observed during both CID and ETD is determined, at least in part, by the location of such basic residues.Finally, studies were undertaken to investigate the factors which may promote/inhibit scrambling of peptide fragment ion sequence, which has recently been shown to take place during CID. The effect of modifying the gas phase basicity of the N-terminal amino acid residue is studied through a combination of derivatisation and synthesis of alternative peptide sequences. Increasing the gas phase basicity is shown to inhibit the observed sequence scrambling while promoting concomitant rearrangement/retention of a carboxyl oxygen at the C-terminus to give enhanced formation of bn+H2O product ion species.

Syndecan-4 Phosphorylation Is a Control Point for Integrin Recycling.
Precise spatiotemporal coordination of integrin adhesion complex dynamics is essential for efficient cell migration. For cells adherent to fibronectin, differential engagement of α5β1 and αVβ3 integrins is used to elicit changes in adhesion complex stability, mechanosensation, matrix assembly, and migration, but the mechanisms responsible for receptor regulation have remained largely obscure. We identify phosphorylation of the membrane-intercalated proteoglycan syndecan-4 as an essential switch controlling integrin recycling. Src phosphorylates syndecan-4 and, by driving syntenin binding, leads to suppression of Arf6 activity and recycling of αVβ3 to the plasma membrane at the expense of α5β1. The resultant elevation in αVβ3 engagement promotes stabilization of focal adhesions. Conversely, abrogation of syndecan-4 phosphorylation drives surface expression of α5β1, destabilizes adhesion complexes, and disrupts cell migration. These data identify the dynamic spatiotemporal regulation of Src-mediated syndecan-4 phosphorylation as an essential switch controlling integrin trafficking and adhesion dynamics to promote efficient cell migration.

An unusual cause of nasal airway obstruction in a neonate: trans-sellar, trans-sphenoidal cephalocoele.
INTRODUCTION: Neonates are obligate nasal breathers, and nasal obstruction may have serious implications. We present an extremely rare cause of neonatal nasal obstruction, and its management. CASE REPORT: An eight-day-old neonate was referred for upper airway obstruction. Initial investigations had identified no obvious cause. Rigid airway endoscopy revealed a large, cystic lesion appearing to arise from the roof of the posterior nasal space. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging indicated a basal cephalocoele projecting inferiorly into the oropharynx, with an intracranial connection to the pituitary fossa. Histology showed fibrovascular tissue lined on one aspect by respiratory type epithelium, with mucous glands present. The tissue contained multiple cystic spaces lined by choroid plexus epithelium, with glial tissue present in the walls of the mass. A transpalatal excision of the nasopharyngeal cephalocoele, with closure of the intracranial connection, palatal repair and lumbar drain placement was undertaken. Post-operative recovery was uneventful, with no evidence of cerebrospinal fluid leakage or palatal dysfunction. CONCLUSION: This surgical approach gave excellent access whilst avoiding the obvious morbidity associated with an intracranial approach. Nasal masses should be considered in the differential diagnosis of neonatal respiratory distress due to nasal obstruction.

Prospects for high temperature ferromagnetism in (Ga,Mn)As semiconductors
We report on a comprehensive combined experimental and theoretical study of Curie temperature trends in (Ga,Mn)As ferromagnetic semiconductors. Broad agreement between theoretical expectations and measured data allows us to conclude that T-c in high-quality metallic samples increases linearly with the number of uncompensated local moments on Mn-Ga acceptors, with no sign of saturation. Room temperature ferromagnetism is expected for a 10% concentration of these local moments. Our magnetotransport and magnetization data are consistent with the picture in which Mn impurities incorporated during growth at interstitial Mn-I positions act as double-donors and compensate neighboring Mn-Ga local moments because of strong near-neighbor Mn-Ga-Mn-I antiferromagnetic coupling. These defects can be efficiently removed by post-growth annealing. Our analysis suggests that there is no fundamental obstacle to substitutional Mn-Ga doping in high-quality materials beyond our current maximum level of 6.8%, although this achievement will require further advances in growth condition control. Modest charge compensation does not limit the maximum Curie temperature possible in ferromagnetic semiconductors based on (Ga,Mn)As.

A consensus report on appropriate treatment optimization and transitioning in the management of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.
BACKGROUND: There is limited information on systemic and biological treatment optimization and transitioning in routine clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: To provide practical guidance on treatment optimization and transitioning for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. METHODS: Dermatologists from 33 countries contributed to the Transitioning Therapies programme. Fourteen questions were identified. Answers were drafted based on systematic literature reviews (7/14 questions) and expert opinion (7/14 questions). Using a modified Delphi procedure, dermatologists from 30 countries voted on their level of agreement with each draft answer (scale: 1-9, strong disagreement to strong agreement). Consensus was defined as ≥75% of participants scoring within the 7-9 range. RESULTS: Consensus was achieved on the answers to all questions. Recommendations for the use of cyclosporine and methotrexate were agreed. Transitioning from a conventional systemic therapy to a biological agent may be done directly or with an overlap (if transitioning is required because of lack of efficacy) or potentially with a treatment-free interval (if transitioning is required for safety reasons). Combination therapy may be beneficial. Continuous therapy for patients on biologicals is strongly recommended. However, during successful maintenance with biological monotherapy, a dosage reduction may be considered to limit drug exposure, although this may carry the risk of decreased efficacy. Switching biologicals for reasons of efficacy should be done without a washout period, but switching for reasons of safety may require a treatment-free interval. CONCLUSION: This consensus provides practical guidance on treatment optimization and transitioning for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, based on literature reviews and the expert opinion of dermatologists from across the globe.

Impaired spontaneous endocytosis of HLA-G.
HLA-G is a class Ib (non-classical) major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein expressed at the maternal-fetal interface that inhibits natural killer (NK) cell-mediated lysis in an allotype-independent manner. Here we report that the spontaneous endocytosis of HLA-G is severely reduced because of its short cytoplasmic tail. Class I (classical) MHC proteins on the surface of B cell transfectants detected by primary and secondary antibodies underwent endocytosis at a moderate rate, whereas HLA-G, chimeric proteins consisting of the extracellular domains of HLA-C with the C-terminal sequence of HLA-G, or glycophosphatidylinositol-tailed HLA-C proteins, were not efficiently internalized. In addition, a mutant of beta 2-microglobulin (Ser88Cys) that could be specifically labeled with Texas red (or other fluorescent probes) and exchanged into class I or class Ib MHC proteins was employed to study spontaneous internalization of MHC proteins by a non-perturbative method independent of an antibody ligand. These data are discussed in terms of both the role of HLA-G expressed on the fetal trophoblast and the function of the cytoplasmic tail in class I MHC proteins.

Social licences to operate: For better not for worse; for richer not for poorer? The impacts of unplanned mining closure for ‘fence-line’ residential communities
Establishing 'social licences to operate‘ with communities has become a significant corporate social responsibility agenda. The complex dynamics of these relationships can compound the impacts for communities when these contracts are not upheld. This article documents reflections from a Rapid Rural Appraisal conducted in the Shire of Ravensthorpe in remote Western Australia after the Ravensthorpe Nickel Operation was 'mothballed‘ nine months into a projected twenty five year life span. It captures how communication about the project and its timeframes created a sense of consistency, predictability, certainty and trust - enabling the social licence. The raising of hope, and the emergence of mistrust underpin the social, environmental and financial impacts of this event for the local community. Embedded in the theoretical dimensions of social licences this case study highlights the problematic of social licences that engage with non-contractual stakeholders as partners in 'booms‘ but have no legal responsibility towards them in times of 'bust‘.

Microscopy and Spectroscopy of Graphene: Atomic Scale Structure and Interaction with Foreign Atom Species
Since its discovery, the one atom thick material graphene has been at the centre of growing interest in two-dimensional materials. Due to its exceptional properties, graphene is a rich topic to explore by physicists, chemists, engineers and materials scientists. In addition to its use in the fundamental research, graphene is also a promising candidate for future electronics, photonics and energy storage devices.The project presented in this thesis was carried out to explore the structure of suspended graphene in particular in order to probe the metal-graphene interaction via Transmission Electron Microscopy, as most graphene applications require interfacing with metals. As the work was based on free standing graphene, graphene layers obtained by mechanical cleavage or growth on a substrate were transferred onto TEM-grids. Therefore, fabrication, suspended sample preparation and identification of graphene layers were first discussed for a better understanding of how to obtain high quality graphene, as this was essential for the rest of the project.Structural, topographic and chemical analysis of pristine suspended graphene layers were investigated in detail via Transmission Electron Microscopy and Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy. The latter technique was also employed for graphene on a substrate along with establishing annealing conditions for residue free graphene.Metal deposited suspended graphene layers were then investigated in the electron microscopes. Different metal behaviours were observed on the graphene surfaces for the same amount of metal evaporation. Generally, metals interact only weakly with graphene as they are not observed on clean (residue free) parts and are mainly clustered. On the other hand, graphene etching has been observed in the presence of metals. The etching was initiated with graphene vacancy formation as a result of the interaction between metal and carbon atoms on clean graphene. Once a vacancy was created, a hole quickly formed and eventually the graphene layers were destroyed. However, those holes created by metals were healed spontaneously either by non-hexagonal or perfect hexagonal rings. The possible etching and healing mechanisms of the suspended graphene were also discussed.

LRIG2 Mutations Cause Urofacial Syndrome.
Urofacial syndrome (UFS) (or Ochoa syndrome) is an autosomal-recessive disease characterized by congenital urinary bladder dysfunction, associated with a significant risk of kidney failure, and an abnormal facial expression upon smiling, laughing, and crying. We report that a subset of UFS-affected individuals have biallelic mutations in LRIG2, encoding leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 2, a protein implicated in neural cell signaling and tumorigenesis. Importantly, we have demonstrated that rare variants in LRIG2 might be relevant to nonsyndromic bladder disease. We have previously shown that UFS is also caused by mutations in HPSE2, encoding heparanase-2. LRIG2 and heparanase-2 were immunodetected in nerve fascicles growing between muscle bundles within the human fetal bladder, directly implicating both molecules in neural development in the lower urinary tract.

Detection of PIK3CA mutations in circulating free DNA in patients with breast cancer.
Somatic mutations in PIK3CA (encoding a class I phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) subunit) modulate PI3K signalling to influence tumour behaviour and occur in up to 40% of breast cancers. Inhibitors of PI3K signalling are entering clinical trials, but the impact of PIKC3A mutation on tumour response has yet to be clarified. This study investigated the potential utility of circulating free DNA (cfDNA) as a source for PIK3CA mutation detection in patients with breast cancer. cfDNA extracted (QIAamp Virus spin kit) from blood and matched archival tumour from 46 patients with metastatic breast cancer and 30 patients with localised, operable breast cancer was assessed for hotspot PIK3CA mutations using Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS()) allele-specific PCR and Scorpion probes. PIK3CA mutations were detected in 13/46 (28%) plasma-derived and 10/46 (21%) serum-derived cfDNA samples from metastatic breast cancer patients. In 41 cases with matched tumour and plasma-derived cfDNA data, concordance (same mutation status in plasma and tumour) was 95%. Where a PIK3CA mutation was present in tumour, the 'pick up' in plasma-derived cfDNA was 80%. PIK3CA mutations were present in tumours from 14/30 (47%) localised breast cancers, but no PIK3CA mutations were detected in matched cfDNA. These data demonstrate feasibility and potential utility of cfDNA for PIK3CA mutation detection in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Studies are underway to qualify PIK3CA mutation in cfDNA as a predictive biomarker allowing patient stratification in clinical trials of mechanism-based therapeutics that target PI3K signalling pathways.

At bronchoscopy, each had bronchial mucous plugging containing Aspergillus fumigatus. This finding was associated with a systemic eosinophilia and skin test positivity to Aspergillus. Augmented steroid therapy resulted in the successful resolution of the symptoms. We believe that these are the first reported cases of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in lung allograft recipients.

[bowel, syndrome, irritable, woman, gynaecological]

Gynaecological consultation in patients with the irritable bowel syndrome.
A 12 month follow up study to assess the impact of symptoms suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome in women presenting to gynaecology clinics with pelvic pain is reported. Of 71 women 37 (52%) had symptoms suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome at presentation. A firm gynaecological diagnosis was reached in only three (8%) women positive for irritable bowel syndrome compared with 15 (44%) without (p = 0.002). After 12 months 24 (65%) women with irritable bowel syndrome were still symptomatic compared with 11 (32%) without (p = 0.01). This study shows that women with irritable bowel syndrome frequently attend gynaecological clinics but rarely have gynaecological pathology and the prognosis is poor in terms of resolution of their pain.

[keloid, fibroblast, pai-2, protein, hsp27, 21-integrin, extracellular, matrix, tension-related]

Up-regulation of tension-related proteins in keloids: knockdown of Hsp27, α2β1-integrin, and PAI-2 shows convincing reduction of extracellular matrix production.
BACKGROUND: Keloid disease is a fibroproliferative disorder, with an ill-defined treatment that is characterized by excessive extracellular matrix deposition. Mechanical tension promotes deposition of extracellular matrix and overexpression of tension-related proteins, which is associated with keloid disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of tension-related proteins on extracellular matrix steady-state synthesis in primary keloid fibroblasts. METHODS: Keloid fibroblasts (n = 10) and normal skin (n = 4) fibroblast cultures were established from passages 0 to 3. A panel of 21 tension-related genes from microarray data were assessed at mRNA (quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) and protein (in-cell Western blotting) levels. Three genes were significantly altered in keloid tissue and fibroblasts, and their functional role was assessed using siRNA knockdown. RESULTS: Hsp27, α2β1-integrin, and PAI-2 were significantly up-regulated (p < 0.05)in keloid tissue and fibroblasts compared with normal skin. Hsp27, α2β1-integrin, and PAI-2 expression was inhibited by RNA interference. Both the mRNA and protein levels of Hsp27, α2β1-integrin, and PAI-2 significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in keloid fibroblasts at 48 hours after transfection. After down-regulation of Hsp27, α2β1-integrin, and PAI-2, the expression of intracellular extracellular matrix was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). Water-soluble tetrazolium salt-1 assay showed that transfection of Hsp27, α2β1-integrin, and PAI-2 did not influence the viability/metabolic activity of keloid fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates overexpression of key tension-related proteins in keloid tissue and keloid fibroblasts. Knockdown of Hsp27, PAI-2, and α2β1-integrin by RNA interference attenuates the expression of mRNA and protein levels and certain other extracellular matrix molecules.

[enol, nucleophilic]

Tertiary alcohols by tandem β-carbolithiation and N→C aryl migration in enol carbamates.
Enol carbamates (O-vinylcarbamates) derived from aromatic or α,β-unsaturated compounds and bearing an N-aryl substituent undergo carbolithiation by nucleophilic attack at the (nominally nucleophilic) β position of the enol double bond. The resulting carbamate-stabilized allylic, propargylic, or benzylic organolithium rearranges with N→C migration of the N-aryl substituent, creating a quaternary carbon α to O. The products may be readily hydrolyzed to yield multiply branched tertiary alcohols in a one-pot tandem reaction, effectively a polarity-reversed nucleophilic β-alkylation-electrophilic α-arylation of an enol equivalent.

Interfacial shear strength of Ti/SiC fibre composites measured by synchrotron strain measurement.
A single fiber Ti/SiCf composite specimen was loaded incrementally and unloaded in-situ on a beam line at the European Synchrotron Research Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble. It was possible to measure the strain along the fiber with a high spatial resoln. (50 mm) within the titanium matrix. The interfacial frictional shear strength inferred from the longitudinal strain profile of the broken fiber was calcd. to be around 200 MPa. The result is compared to the interfacial shear stress derived from other methods developed to evaluate the matrix/reinforcement interface in this system. An axisym. finite element model gave good agreement between the numerical and exptl. results. on SciFinder (R)

A comparative study of the efficacy of fluconazole and amphotericin B in the treatment of oropharyngeal candidosis in patients undergoing radiotherapy for head and neck tumours.
Radiotherapy given during treatment of oral and pharyngeal malignancy is frequently associated with colonization of the oral mucosa by Candida species. Treatment of these infections has included topical and systemic agents. In the present study 73 patients with oropharyngeal candidosis were treated with either amphotericin B (10 mg lozenges, four times daily for 14 days, 36 patients) or fluconazole (50 mg daily for 7 days, 37 patients). The yeasts most frequently isolated were C albicans and C glabrata. Clinical signs and symptoms showed improvement at end of treatment in 72% of patients who received amphotericin B compared with 92% of patients who received fluconazole. Mycological cure at end of treatment was achieved in 31% of the amphotericin B group and 46% of patients who received fluconazole. For both treatments the cure rate was less in denture wearers than in non denture wearers.

[scar, avotermin, placebo, group, surgery, revision, appearance]

Avotermin for scar improvement following scar revision surgery: a randomized, double-blind, within-patient, placebo-controlled, phase II clinical trial.
BACKGROUND: Skin scarring is associated with psychosocial distress and has a negative effect on quality of life. The transforming growth factor (TGF)-β family of cytokines plays a key role in scarring. TGF-β3 improves scar appearance in a range of mammalian species. This study was performed to assess the efficacy of intradermal avotermin (TGF-β3) for the improvement of scar appearance following scar revision surgery. METHODS: Sixty patients (35 men and 25 women; age, 19 to 78 years; 53 Caucasians; scar length, 5 to 21 cm) received intradermal avotermin (200 ng/100 μl/linear cm wound margin) and placebo to outer wound segments immediately after, and again 24 hours after, complete (group 1) or staged (group 2) scar revision surgery. A within-patient design was chosen to control for interindividual factors that affect scarring. The primary efficacy variable was a total scar score derived from a visual analogue scale, scored by a lay panel from standardized photographs from months 1 through 7 following treatment. RESULTS: : Primary endpoint data from the combined surgical groups showed that avotermin significantly improved scar appearance compared with placebo (total scar score difference, 21.93 mm; p = 0.04). Profilometry showed a greater reduction in scar surface area from baseline with avotermin treatment compared with placebo, significant in group 2 at months 7 and 12 (difference, 41.99 mm and 25.85 mm, respectively; p = 0.03 for both comparisons). Histologic analysis from group 2 showed that, compared with placebo treatment, collagen organization in avotermin-treated scars more closely resembled normal skin in 14 of 19 cases. Avotermin was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Avotermin administration following scar revision surgery is well tolerated and significantly improves scar appearance compared with placebo.

The Drug Treatment Outcomes Research Study (DTORS): research design and baseline data
The Drug Treatment Outcomes Research Study (DTORS) is the more recent of two such major English studies. Over the past decade, a substantial policy shift has emphasised the role of treatment in diverting drug misusing offenders
from the criminal justice system. At the same time, changes in the drug-using population, particularly increasing levels of crack cocaine use, have led to an acute need to evaluate the extent to which drug treatment works. DTORS consists of
three components: the main, quantitative element tracking the treatment progress of N=1,796 drug treatment seekers; qualitative work using data from a sample of treatment seekers and treatment providers; and a cost effectiveness analysis.
This paper provides an overview of the methods used for the main quantitative element; a longitudinal, nationwide, multisite, observational, cohort study using survey interviews to assess the impact of treatment on drug use, offending, and
health. An overview of the DTORS baseline sample is provided and compared with the target population of drug treatment seekers in England. Participants were drug users seeking treatment from community based or residential treatment services, assessed at baseline and followed up over a 12-month period. The baseline DTORS sample was predominantly male (73%) and aged 25 to 34 (47%). Primary problem drugs included heroin (57%) and crack (12%) with drugs used in the month prior to baseline having a mean value of £1,213. 72% committed offences in the 12 months before recruitment, most commonly shoplifting or buying and selling stolen goods.

Investigation of 1.3-mu m GaInNAs vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) using temperature, high-pressure, and modelling techniques
<p>We have investigated the temperature and pressure dependence of the threshold current (I-th) of 1.3 mum emitting GaInNAs vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) and the equivalent edge-emitting laser (EEL) devices employing the same active region. Our measurements show that the VCSEL devices have the peak of the gain spectrum on the high-energy side of the cavity mode energy and hence operate over a wide temperature range. They show particularly promising I-th temperature insensitivity in the 250-350 K range. We have then used a theoretical model based on a 10-band k.P Hamiltonian and experimentally determined recombination coefficients from EELs to calculate the pressure and temperature dependency of I-th. The results show good agreement between the model and the experimental data, supporting both the validity of the model and the recombination rate parameters. We also show that for both device types, the super-exponential temperature dependency of I-th at 350 K and above is due largely to Auger recombination.</p>

[hearing, loss, patient, datum]

Hearing loss in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis II: data from HOS - the Hunter Outcome Survey.
BACKGROUND: Subjectively reported hearing loss is a common feature of mucopolysaccharidosis II (MPS II, Hunter syndrome). This study provides an epidemiological description of hearing loss and other otolaryngological manifestations reported by patients registered in the Hunter Outcome Survey (HOS), an international registry of patients with MPS II. METHODS: Data about ear signs and symptoms were available for 554 of the 605 patients alive at HOS entry. The degree of hearing loss for 162 pure-tone audiograms (PTAs) from 83 patients was classified by independent interpreters using both the age-specific International Institute of Standardization (ISO) 7029 standard and the age-independent World Health Organization (WHO) clinical guidelines. A linear regression analysis using cross-sectional data was conducted to investigate the relationship between hearing loss and age. RESULTS: The most prevalent otolaryngological manifestations and interventions reported were otitis (either acute otitis media or chronic otitis media 72%), hearing loss (67%), insertion of ventilation tubes (50%), adenoidectomy (47%), and hearing aids (41%). According to the ISO standard, only one patient out of the 83 with audiogram data in HOS had normal hearing in both ears at all time points. According to the WHO classification, 16% had normal hearing; hearing loss was mild in 24%, moderate in 31%, severe in 22%, and profound in 7%. In the linear regression analysis, the hearing threshold in the cohort increased with age at an estimated rate of approximately 1 dB per year. CONCLUSIONS: Hearing impairment is common in MPS II. Early otolaryngological evaluation and intervention is recommended.

[membrane, immunological, cell, order, synapse, lipid, spatial]

High plasma membrane lipid order imaged at the immunological synapse periphery in live T cells.
Cholesterol- and glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane lipid microdomains, frequently called lipid rafts, are thought to play an important role in the spatial and temporal organization of immunological synapses. Higher ordering of lipid acyl chains was suggested for these entities and imaging of membrane order in living cells during activation can therefore help to understand the mechanisms responsible for the supramolecular organization of molecules involved in the activation of T cells. Here, we employ the phase-sensitive membrane dye di-4-ANEPPDHQ together with a variety of spectrally-resolved microscopy techniques, including 2-channel ratiometric TIRF microscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging, to characterize membrane order at the T cell immunological synapse at high spatial and temporal resolution in live cells at physiological temperature. We find that higher membrane order resides at the immunological synapse periphery where proximal signalling through the immunoreceptors and accessory proteins in microclusters has previously been shown to take place. The observed spatial patterning of membrane order in the immunological synapse depends on active receptor signalling.

An early and sustained peripheral inflammatory response in acute ischaemic stroke: relationships with infection and atherosclerosis.
Central nervous system and peripheral inflammation is important in the responses to ischaemic stroke, and may also predispose to its development. We aimed to identify (1) the extent to which a peripheral inflammatory response is activated in patients following acute stroke, and (2) whether there was evidence for preexisting peripheral inflammation. Thirty-six patients with ischaemic stroke within 12 h of onset of symptoms had serial blood samples taken up to 12 months for analysis of markers of inflammation. Thirty-six control subjects, individually matched for age, sex and degree of atherosclerosis, were also studied. Median C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated, relative to controls (2.08 mg/l), from admission (4.31 mg/l) (p</=0.001) until 3 months (2.90 mg/l) (p</=0.01), the greatest elevation occurring at 5-7 days (17.67 mg/l) (p</=0.001). Elevations were also seen in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and white blood cell (WBC) count until 3 months. Median plasma IL-6 was also elevated, relative to controls (9 pg/ml), by 24 h after onset of symptoms (22 pg/ml) (p</=0.01), and remained elevated at 5-7 days (23 pg/ml) (p</=0.01), but not at 3 months. Less marked elevations in these markers were seen in patients without evidence of infection except for IL-6, which was not increased in the absence of infection. These data provide evidence of an early and sustained peripheral inflammatory response to acute ischaemic stroke in patients with or without evidence of infection. The very early increase in concentrations of inflammatory markers after stroke may either be induced by stroke itself, or may indicate a preexisting inflammatory condition in stroke patients which may contribute to the development of stroke.

Prevalent cartilage damage and cartilage loss over time are associated with incident bone marrow lesions in the tibiofemoral compartments: the MOST study.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of prevalent cartilage damage and cartilage loss over time with incident bone marrow lesions (BMLs) in the same subregion of the tibiofemoral compartments as detected on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: The Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study is an observational study of individuals with or at risk for knee osteoarthritis (OA). Subjects whose baseline and 30-month follow-up MRIs were read for findings of OA were included. MRI was performed with a 1.0 T extremity system. Tibiofemoral compartments were divided into 10 subregions. Cartilage morphology was scored from 0 to 6 and BMLs were scored from 0 to 3. Prevalent cartilage damage and cartilage loss over time were considered predictors of incident BMLs. Associations were assessed using logistic regression, with adjustments for potential confounders. RESULTS: Medially, incident BMLs were associated with baseline cartilage damage (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 3.9 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.0, 5.1), incident cartilage loss (7.3 95% CI 5.0, 10.7) and progression of cartilage loss (7.6 95% CI 5.1, 11.3) Laterally, incident BMLs were associated with baseline cartilage damage (4.1 95% CI 2.6, 6.3), incident cartilage loss (6.0 95% CI 3.1, 11.8), and progression of cartilage loss (11.9 95% CI 6.2, 23.0). CONCLUSION: Prevalent cartilage damage and cartilage loss over time are strongly associated with incident BMLs in the same subregion, supporting the significance of the close interrelation of the osteochondral unit in the progression of knee OA.

SpiNNaker: Distributed Computer Engineering for Neuromorphics
SpiNNaker is a biologically-inspired massively-parallel computer architecture optimized specifically for modeling large-scale systems of spiking neurons in biological real time. The biological inspiration is manifest in the lightweight inter-processor communications architecture, which enables a “spike” generated by a neuron modeled on one processor to be transmitted to all of the processors modeling neurons that the source neuron connects to in zero biological time (which we take to be a time much less than a millisecond). The design of such a machine is based upon achieving a balance between the processing power required to execute the neuron and synapse models, the memory hierarchy required to maintain neuron and synapse state sufficiently close to the respective processor, and a communications infrastructure that can meet the latency and bandwidth constraints of the target application.

Electromagnetic therapy for treating venous leg ulcers.
BACKGROUND: Leg ulceration is a common, chronic, recurring condition. The estimated prevalence of leg ulcers in the UK population is 1.5 to 3 per 1000. Venous ulcers (also called stasis or varicose ulcers) comprise 80% to 85% of all leg ulcers. Electromagnetic therapy (EMT) is sometimes used as a treatment to assist the healing of chronic wounds such as venous leg ulcers. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of EMT on the healing of venous leg ulcers. SEARCH METHODS: For this third update, we searched The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 12 November 2012); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 10); Ovid MEDLINE (2011 to November Week 1 2012); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, November 12, 2012); Ovid EMBASE (2011 to 2012 Week 45); and EBSCO CINAHL (2011 to 9 November 2012). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing EMT with sham-EMT or other treatments. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently scrutinised search results and obtained full reports of potentially eligible studies for further assessment. We extracted and summarised details of eligible studies using a data extraction sheet, and made attempts to obtain missing data by contacting study authors. A second review author checked data extraction, and we resolved disagreements after discussion between review authors. MAIN RESULTS: Three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of variable quality involving 94 people were included in the original review; subsequent updates have identified no new trials. All the trials compared the use of EMT with sham-EMT. In the two trials that reported healing rates; one small trial (44 participants) reported that significantly more ulcers healed in the EMT group than the sham-EMT group however this result was not robust to different assumptions about the outcomes of participants who were lost to follow up. The second trial that reported numbers of ulcers healed found no significant difference in healing. The third trial was also small (31 participants) and reported significantly greater reductions in ulcer size in the EMT group however this result may have been influenced by differences in the prognostic profiles of the treatment groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no high quality evidence that electromagnetic therapy increases the rate of healing of venous leg ulcers, and further research is needed.

The non-synonymous SNP, R1150W, in SCN9A is not associated with chronic widespread pain susceptibility.
ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Mutations in SCN9A, encoding the alpha subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav1.7), have caused severe pain disorders and congenital insensitivity to pain. The aim of this study was to validate the previously reported association between a common non-synonymous polymorphism (R1150W, rs6746030) in SCN9A and chronic widespread pain (CWP), in independent population-based cohorts. FINDINGS: Genotype data for rs6746030 was available in four population-based cohorts (EPIFUND, the European Male Ageing Study (EMAS), the Framingham study and the Dyne Steel DNA Bank of Ageing and Cognition). Pain was assessed using body manikins and CWP was scored using American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria in all cohorts, except the Framingham study which assessed widespread pain (WP) using ACR criteria on a joint pain homunculus. Controls were subjects who reported no pain. Logistic regression (additive genetic model) was used to test for association between rs6746030 and CWP compared to controls, adjusting for study centre in EMAS. Generalised estimating equation regression was used to test for association between rs6746030 and WP, whilst accounting for relatedness between subjects in the Framingham study.Genotype data for rs6746030 was available for 1071 CWP cases and 3212 controls. There was no significant association between CWP and rs6476030 in individual cohorts or when combined in a fixed-effects meta-analysis (Odds Ratio = 0.96 (95% confidence interval 0.82, 1.11) p = 0.567). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to a previous study, no association between a non-synonymous polymorphism in SCN9A and CWP was observed in multiple population-based cohorts.

Clinical significance and molecular characteristics of circulating tumor cells and circulating tumor microemboli in patients with small-cell lung cancer.
PURPOSE: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) may have utility as surrogate biomarkers and "virtual" biopsies. We report the clinical significance and molecular characteristics of CTCs and CTC clusters, termed circulating tumor microemboli (CTM), detected in patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) undergoing standard treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serial blood samples from 97 patients receiving chemotherapy were analyzed using EpCam-based immunomagnetic detection and a filtration-based technique. Proliferation status (Ki67) and apoptotic morphology were examined. Associations of CTC and CTM number with clinical factors and prognosis were determined. RESULTS: CTCs were present in 85% of patients (77 of 97 patients) and were abundant (mean ± standard deviation = 1,589 ± 5,565). CTM and apoptotic CTCs were correlated with total CTC number and were detected in 32% and 57% of patients, respectively. Pretreatment CTCs, change in CTC number after one cycle of chemotherapy, CTM, and apoptotic CTCs were independent prognostic factors. Overall survival was 5.4 months for patients with ≥ 50 CTCs/7.5 mL of blood and 11.5 months (P < .0001) for patients with less than 50 CTCs/7.5 mL of blood before chemotherapy (hazard ratio = 2.45; 95% CI, 1.39 to 4.30; P = .002). Subpopulations of apoptotic and of proliferating solitary CTCs were detected, whereas neither were observed within cell clusters (CTM), implicating both protection from anoikis and relative resistance to cytotoxic drugs for cells within CTM. CONCLUSION: Both baseline CTC number and change in CTC number after one cycle of chemotherapy are independent prognostic factors for SCLC. Molecular comparison of CTCs to cells in CTM may provide novel insights into SCLC biology.

The potential role of cell adhesion molecules in the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy.
Cross-sectional studies have shown plasma cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) to be increased in patients with diabetes-related complications. In the first prospective study of CAMs, we have shown that plasma CAMs may be a predictor of the development of diabetic neuropathy. We followed up 28 diabetic patients (13 neuropathic) over a 5 year period, starting from 1991. All patients had peroneal nerve conduction velocity (PNCV), vibration perception threshold and plasma CAMs measured at baseline and follow-up. We found P-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) to be increased at baseline in patients with neuropathy compared to non-neuropathic patients. P-selectin and E-selectin were also found to be significantly higher at baseline in patients who at follow-up showed deterioration in PNCV of more than 3 m/s (p<0.05; p=0.01; respectively). P-selectin and ICAM-1 strongly correlated with PNCV. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses showed a significant inverse association between increasing log P-selectin, log E-selectin and log ICAM-1 with decreasing PNCV, and remained significant even after adjustment for glycaemic control. P-selectin and E-selectin, odds ratios of 8.8 (95% CI: 1.1-68.8; p=0.038) and 12.5 (95% CI: 1.2-132.1; p=0.036), respectively, were significantly associated with the risk of deterioration of PNCV after 5 years. This study suggests that plasma cell adhesion molecules may play an important role in the development and progression of peripheral neuropathy in diabetes mellitus.

[keloid, senescence, scar, fibroblast]

Cellular senescence as a possible mechanism for halting progression of keloid lesions.
Keloid scarring is a consequence of aberrant wound healing that leads to expansion of the scar beyond the confines of the skin injury. Keloid scars are characterized by excessive extracellular matrix disposition, prolonged proliferation of fibroblasts, increased angiogenesis, and inflammatory cell infiltration. There is no single satisfactory treatment for keloid, and it can lead to severe disfigurements and bodily dysfunction. Thus, clarification of the mechanisms underlying keloid formation, as well as those that prevent it from behaving as a malignant tumor, has significant consequences not only for treatment of keloid but also for the prevention of malignant tumor formation. Senescence is an irreversible form of growth arrest that has been shown to play a role, both in vitro and in vivo, in preventing malignant tumorigenesis upon oncogenic stress. In this study it is shown that fibroblasts embedded inside keloid scars proliferate at a slower rate compared with either those residing at the proliferative edges of the scar or normal fibroblasts. Likewise it is demonstrated that keloid fibroblasts exhibit a cell-cycle arrest with a G2/M DNA content and a higher rate of senescence. The results also indicate that levels of the tumor suppressor protein PML are higher in the active regions of keloid. The study therefore suggests that senescence is one possible mechanism by which keloid is maintained in a benign state. On this basis, "pro-senescence therapy" should be taken into consideration when designing treatment strategies for keloid.

Nitrogen cycling in oxygen deficient zones : insights from δ15N and δ18O of nitrite and nitrate
The stable isotopes, δ15N and δ18O, of nitrite and nitrate can be powerful tools used to interpret nitrogen cycling in the ocean. In order to interpret isotope profiles, the isotope systematics of each process involved must be known. This thesis describes numerous experiments using both cultures of nitrifying organisms as well as natural seawater samples to determine the oxygen isotope systematics of nitrification. These experiments show that the accumulation of nitrite has a large effect on the resulting δ18ONO3. Also, the δ18ONO2 was developed as a unique tracer because it undergoes abiotic equilibration with water δ18O at a predictable rate based on pH, temperature and salinity. This rate, its dependencies, and how the δ18ONO2 values can be used as not only biological source indicators but also indicators of age are described. Finally, using the isotope systematics of nitrification as well as the properties of nitrite oxygen isotope exchange described in this thesis, the final chapter interprets multi-isotope nitrate and nitrite profiles in the Costa Rica Upwelling Dome using a simple 1D model.

[cell, mitochondrial, epidermal, stem, chain, function]

The mitochondrial electron transport chain is dispensable for proliferation and differentiation of epidermal progenitor cells.
Tissue stem cells and germ line or embryonic stem cells were shown to have reduced oxidative metabolism, which was proposed to be an adaptive mechanism to reduce damage accumulation caused by reactive oxygen species. However, an alternate explanation is that stem cells are less dependent on specialized cytoplasmic functions compared with differentiated cells, therefore, having a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic volume ratio and consequently a low mitochondrial content. To determine whether stem cells rely or not on mitochondrial respiration, we selectively ablated the electron transport chain in the basal layer of the epidermis, which includes the epidermal progenitor/stem cells (EPSCs). This was achieved using a loxP-flanked mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) allele in conjunction with a keratin 14 Cre transgene. The epidermis of these animals (Tfam(EKO)) showed a profound depletion of mitochondrial DNA and complete absence of respiratory chain complexes. However, despite a short lifespan due to malnutrition, epidermal development and skin barrier function were not impaired. Differentiation of epidermal layers was normal and no proliferation defect or major increase of apoptosis could be observed. In contrast, mice with an epidermal ablation of prohibitin-2, a scaffold protein in the inner mitochondrial membrane, displayed a dramatic phenotype observable already in utero, with severely impaired skin architecture and barrier function, ultimately causing death from dehydration shortly after birth. In conclusion, we here provide unequivocal evidence that EPSCs, and probably tissue stem cells in general, are independent of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, but still require a functional dynamic mitochondrial compartment.

Alginate dressings for healing diabetic foot ulcers.
BACKGROUND: Foot ulcers in people with diabetes mellitus are a common and serious global health issue. Dressings form a key part of ulcer treatment, with clinicians and patients having many different types to choose from including alginate dressings. A clear and current overview of current evidence is required to facilitate decision-making regarding dressing use. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of alginate wound dressings with no wound dressing or alternative dressings on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes mellitus. SEARCH METHODS: We searched The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 4 January 2012); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4); Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to December Week 3 2011); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, January 03, 2012); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 52); and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 30 December 2011). There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA: Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that have compared the effects on ulcer healing of alginate dressings with alternative wound dressings or no dressing in the treatment of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. MAIN RESULTS: We included six studies (375 participants) in this review; these compared alginate dressings with basic wound contact dressings, foam dressings and a silver-containing, fibrous-hydrocolloid dressing. Meta analysis of two studies found no statistically significant difference between alginate dressings and basic wound contact dressings: risk ratio (RR) 1.09 (95% CI 0.66 to 1.80). Pooled data from two studies comparing alginate dressings with foam dressings found no statistically significant difference in ulcer healing (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.08). There was no statistically significant difference in the number of diabetic foot ulcers healed when an anti-microbial (silver) hydrocolloid dressing was compared with a standard alginate dressing (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.47). All studies had short follow-up times (six to 12 weeks), and small sample sizes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Currently there is no research evidence to suggest that alginate wound dressings are more effective in healing foot ulcers in people with diabetes than other types of dressing however many trials in this field are very small. Decision makers may wish to consider aspects such as dressing cost and the wound management properties offered by each dressing type e.g. exudate management.

Anorectal manometry in irritable bowel syndrome: differences between diarrhoea and constipation predominant subjects.
Anorectal manometry with balloon distension was performed on 28 patients with diarrhoea predominant irritable bowel syndrome, 27 patients with constipation predominant irritable bowel syndrome and 30 normal controls. In the diarrhoea predominant group balloon volumes required to perceive the sensations of gas, stool, urgency of defecation and discomfort were significantly lower than in controls or constipation predominant patients (p less than 0.001). Diarrhoea predominant patients also had a significantly lower rectal compliance than controls or constipation predominant patients (p less than 0.03) but showed no difference in motor activity induced by distension. When the constipation predominant patients were compared with controls the only significant difference that emerged was in the volume at which discomfort was perceived. No significant differences between constipated subjects and controls were found in the distension induced motor activity. Symptom severity and psychological parameters were also recorded and the diarrhoea predominant patients were found to be more anxious than those with constipation (p = 0.04). It proved possible (by comparison with the control group) to identify three abnormal rectal subtypes in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. These were a sensitive rectum (low sensation thresholds, normal or low rectal pressure), a stiff rectum (normal or low sensation thresholds, high pressure) and an insensitive rectum (high sensation thresholds, normal or high pressure) and their distribution varied considerably depending on bowel habit. Some form of rectal abnormality was identified in 75% of diarrhoea predominant patients compared with 30% of constipation predominant subjects (p = 0.002). A sensitive rectum was a particular feature of diarrhoea predominant patients being observed in 57% of patients compared with only 7% of the constipated group (p less than 0.001).

A pilot study assessing the prognostic value of CK18 and nDNA biomarkers in severe sepsis patients
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:

Severe sepsis and septic shock have posed significant treatment challenges for many years. Recently, a number of circulating apoptosis biomarkers have emerged, such as full-length and caspase-cleaved cytokeratin 18 (CK18) and nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), that may be predictive of likely outcome. This non-interventional study aimed to assess the ability of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for these biomarkers to provide clinically useful information to guide the management of sepsis.
METHODS:

This study was conducted in patients admitted to the intensive care unit with severe sepsis at five US centres. Blood samples for assessment of plasma levels of full-length CK18 (measured by the M65® ELISA) and caspase-cleaved CK18 (measured by the M30-Apoptosense® ELISA) and nDNA (measured by ELISA) were collected from patients within 2 hours of consent (baseline) and on days 2, 4 and 8. Blood samples from 17 healthy volunteers acted as controls. Levels of each biomarker were presented descriptively.
RESULTS:

A total of 22 patients (mean age 60 range, 24-83 years; 50% male) were included in the study. The mean APACHE II score was 24.4 (range 7-50). One-third of patients had three organ system failures and over one-half had septic shock. Three patients died during the study. Full-length and caspase-cleaved CK18 levels decreased within 48 hours following initiation of treatment of sepsis in patients who survived, whereas increases were observed in the same timeframe in patients who died within 28 days of admission. Baseline nDNA and total soluble CK18 levels (caspase-cleaved and total intact) were significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher in patients who required renal support than those who did not.
CONCLUSIONS:

Despite the small numbers of subjects assessed in the current study, these results confirm that measurement of apoptosis biomarkers may help to provide clinically useful information to manage sepsis and expedite development of novel therapeutics. However, further investigations to fully assess their prognostic value are required.

TaxMan : a server to trim rRNA reference databases and inspect taxonomic coverage
Amplicon sequencing of the hypervariable regions of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene is a widely accepted method for identifying the members of complex bacterial communities. Several rRNA gene sequence reference databases can be used to assign taxonomic names to the sequencing reads using BLAST, USEARCH, GAST or the RDP classifier. Next-generation sequencing methods produce ample reads, but they are short, currently ∼100–450 nt (depending on the technology), as compared to the full rRNA gene of ∼1550 nt. It is important, therefore, to select the right rRNA gene region for sequencing. The primers should amplify the species of interest and the hypervariable regions should differentiate their taxonomy. Here, we introduce TaxMan: a web-based tool that trims reference sequences based on user-selected primer pairs and returns an assessment of the primer specificity by taxa. It allows interactive plotting of taxa, both amplified and missed in silico by the primers used. Additionally, using the trimmed sequences improves the speed of sequence matching algorithms. The smaller database greatly improves run times (up to 98%) and memory usage, not only of similarity searching (BLAST), but also of chimera checking (UCHIME) and of clustering the reads (UCLUST).

Valuation of Government Policies and Projects
Governments play a central role in the allocation of capital and risk in the economy. Evaluating the cost to taxpayers of government investments requires an assumption about the government’s cost of capital. Governments often take their borrowing rate to be their
cost of capital, which implicitly treats the market risk associated with their activities as having no cost to taxpayers. This article reviews the theoretical and practical rationale for treating market risk as a cost to governments, presents an interpretive review of the growing literature that applies the concepts and tools of modern finance to evaluating the costs of government policies and projects 
and suggests directions for future research. Examples considered include deposit insurance, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending facilities, student loans, real infrastructure investments, and public pension plans.

Clinical expert guidelines for the management of cough in lung cancer: report of a UK task group on cough.
BACKGROUND: Cough is a common and distressing symptom in lung cancer patients. The clinical management of cough in lung cancer patients is suboptimal with limited high quality research evidence available. The aim of the present paper is to present a clinical guideline developed in the UK through scrutiny of the literature and expert opinion, in order to aid decision making in clinicians and highlight good practice. METHODS: Two systematic reviews, one focusing on the management of cough in respiratory illness and one Cochrane review specifically on cancer, were conducted. Also, data from reviews, phase II trials and case studies were synthesized. A panel of experts in the field was also convened in an expert consensus meeting to make sense of the data and make clinical propositions. RESULTS: A pyramid of cough management was developed, starting with the treatment of reversible causes of cough/specific pathology. Initial cough management should focus on peripherally acting and intermittent treatment; more resistant symptoms require the addition of (or replacement by) centrally acting and continuous treatment. The pyramid for the symptomatic management starts from the simpler and most practical regimens (demulcents, simple linctus) to weak opioids to morphine and methadone before considering less well-researched and experimental approaches. CONCLUSION: The clinical guidelines presented aim to provide a sensible clinical approach to the management of cough in lung cancer. High quality research in this field is urgently required to provide more evidence-based recommendations.

Micromechanics of residual stress and texture development due to poling in polycrystalline ferroelectric ceramics
This paper presents micromechanics based analysis of elastic strain and changes in the texture of poled polycrystalline ferroelectric PZT ceramics for direct comparison with synchrotron Xray measurements. The grains are modelled as spherical inclusions. to which transformation strains are assigned depending on the fractions of different ferroelectric domains. Eshelby's inclusion problem with the classical self-consistent method is applied to evaluate the elastic state of the grains. In particular, the elongation due to lattice elastic strain is calculated as a function of inclination T relative to the polar axis. The ratio of diffraction peak intensties. corresponding to the domain fractions, is also expressed as a function of T. This analysis identifies the special; character of the (I 1 1) reflection, for which the lattice strain along (I 1 1) in the stress free state is independent of ferroelectric domain population and hence unaffected by poling. The elongation due to the lattice strain parallel to (I 1 1) and peak intensity ratio are expressed in terms of the overall macroscopic strain of a poled specimen, each having a cos(2) Psi dependence.

A critical role for ICOS co-stimulation in immune containment of pulmonary influenza virus infection.
Lung pathology observed during influenza infection is due to direct damage resulting from viral replication and bystander damage caused by overly exuberant antiviral immune mechanisms. In the absence of universally effective vaccines and antiviral therapies, knowledge of the cellular components required for immune containment of influenza is essential. ICOS is a late co-stimulatory molecule expressed by T cells 12-24 h after activation. We show for the first time that inhibition of ICOS with a monoclonal antibody reduces pulmonary T cell inflammation and associated cytokine expression. Surprisingly however, this reduction in T cells was not accompanied by an alleviation of weight loss and illness. Furthermore, lung viral titres were elevated following anti-ICOS treatment, suggesting that the beneficial outcome of reducing T cell pathology was masked by enhanced virus-induced damage and innate inflammation. This study demonstrates the delicate balance that exists between pathogen burden and pulmonary T cell inflammation during influenza infection and highlights the critical role of ICOS in this response.

International consensus on (ICON) pediatric asthma.
Asthma is the most common chronic lower respiratory disease in childhood throughout the world. Several guidelines and/or consensus documents are available to support medical decisions on pediatric asthma. Although there is no doubt that the use of common systematic approaches for management can considerably improve outcomes, dissemination and implementation of these are still major challenges. Consequently, the International Collaboration in Asthma, Allergy and Immunology (iCAALL), recently formed by the EAACI, AAAAI, ACAAI, and WAO, has decided to propose an International Consensus on (ICON) Pediatric Asthma. The purpose of this document is to highlight the key messages that are common to many of the existing guidelines, while critically reviewing and commenting on any differences, thus providing a concise reference. The principles of pediatric asthma management are generally accepted. Overall, the treatment goal is disease control. To achieve this, patients and their parents should be educated to optimally manage the disease, in collaboration with healthcare professionals. Identification and avoidance of triggers is also of significant importance. Assessment and monitoring should be performed regularly to re-evaluate and fine-tune treatment. Pharmacotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment. The optimal use of medication can, in most cases, help patients control symptoms and reduce the risk for future morbidity. The management of exacerbations is a major consideration, independent of chronic treatment. There is a trend toward considering phenotype-specific treatment choices; however, this goal has not yet been achieved.

ELECTROCHEMICAL STUDIES OF MOBILE CHARGED SPECIES DURING ZIRCONIUM ALLOY OXIDATION
This research has used a suite of electrochemical techniques, both in-situ and ex-situ to investigate the mobile charged species in the oxides of zirconium alloys. Limits on the corrosion resistance of existing zirconium alloys used for fuel cladding are a major restriction on the burn-up that can be achieved within a pressurised water reactor (PWR). Developing a full mechanistic understanding of the corrosion process of zirconium alloys in the primary water environment is necessary for prolonging the life-time of fuel cladding. A key component in the corrosion of zirconium alloy is the transport properties of various charged species within the oxide layer, which determine the rate of corrosion. Three distinct electrochemical methods have been employed in this work. The first technique, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), has been used to determine the physical properties of the oxide. The second technique, Mott-Schottky analysis, studied the oxide acceptor/donor densities; hence the nature, concentration and activation energy of the major electronic charge carrier could be determined. The final method, a DC method known as Wagner-asymmetric polarization (WAP), separated the ionic and electronic currents and can thus allow the calculation of transport numbers, partial conductivities and activation energies of the ionic species. All the techniques investigated parameters as a function of oxidation time, lithium concentration and alloying elements.Work was carried out on oxides grown under PWR conditions (2 ppm Li and 1000 ppm B) at temperatures of 240-360 °C on specimens of zircaloy-4, ZIRLO, Zr-0.1%Nb and Zr-1%Nb. The EIS was undertaken in-situ to determine the oxide thickness and showed that the electrochemically active oxide grows quicker in a higher lithium concentration. Variances in oxide growth rates are also seen between specimens of differing niobium and tin content.In-situ Mott-Schottky analysis of the electronic charge carriers within the thin oxide showed the oxide to be a n-type semiconductor. Hence the dominant charge carriers, for early stage oxidation of Zircaloy-4 under simulated PWR conditions, were electrons with a donor density of approximately 2 x 1017 cm-3. The addition of lithium to the oxidation environment increases the donor density, which indicates lithium plays a previously unknown active role in the corrosion process.Despite the oxide being highly resistive, this research has also shown that the ionic charge carriers within the oxide can be directly measured using asymmetric-polarisation. However, further work needs to be undertaken to perfect this technique under inert atmospheres.

Investigating Potential Mediators in the Relationship between Psychosis and Childhood Trauma
Background: Substantial evidence exists for the predictive relationship between trauma and psychosis. However, few studies have explored indirect relationships between these and none have concurrently investigated a potential mediating effect of schematic beliefs or dissociative experiences in a psychosis sample. This study proposed such an investigation amongst participants in the ACTION trial, who have abstained from neuroleptic medication for at least six months. Method: A cross-sectional investigation of positive and general psychotic symptoms using the PANSS and PSYRATS with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Brief Core Schema Scale and the Dissociative Experiences Scale where completed at the 3 month assessment stage of the ACTION trial (n=39). Results: Zero-order correlations between all subscales revealed significant relationships to guide the selection of variables for mediation analysis. The conditions for planned mediations were not satisfied; therefore multiple regressions were performed using appropriate subscales on measures of psychotic symptoms. Significant relationships were found for negative beliefs about the self with general psychotic symptoms, delusions and persecutory ideation, measured on the PANSS. Dissociation significantly predicted auditory hallucinations, measured on the PSYRATS. However subsequent correlations, multiple logistic and binary logistic regressions found no evidence of trauma predicting symptoms, in particular sexual abuse and voice hearing; a relationship supported by substantial existing evidence.Discussion: The implications of these results are discussed in relation to trauma prevalence, sample size and power and the potentially unique characteristics of the participant group, which remains relatively unexplored. Future research amongst such participants is encouraged to complete the investigation exploring indirect effects between such variables.

Suppressed cellular oscillations in Afterhours mutant mice are associated with enhanced circadian phase-resetting.
Within the core molecular clock, protein phosphorylation and degradation play a vital role in determining circadian period. The 'after-hours' (Afh) mutation in mouse slows the degradation of the core clock protein CRY, lengthening the period of the molecular clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei and behavioural wheel-running rhythms. However, we do not yet know how the Afh mutation affects other aspects of physiology or the activity of circadian oscillators in other brain regions. Here we report that daily rhythms of metabolism and ingestive behaviours are altered in these animals, as are PER2::LUC rhythms in mediobasal hypothalamic nuclei which influence these behaviours. Overall there is a trend towards period lengthening and a decrease in amplitude of PER2::LUC rhythms throughout the brain. Imaging of single cells from the arcuate and dorsomedial nuclei revealed this reduction in tissue oscillator amplitude to be due to a decrease in the amplitude, rather than a desynchrony, of single cells. Consistent with existing models of oscillator function this cellular phenotype was associated with a greater susceptibility to phase-shifting stimuli in vivo and in vitro, with light evoking high amplitude Type 0 resetting in Afh mutant mice. Together, these findings reveal unexpected consequences of the Afh mutation on the amplitude and synchrony of individual cellular oscillators in the suprachiasmatic nuclei.

Quantitative risk assessment for skin sensitisation: consideration of a simplified approach for hair dye ingredients.
With the availability of the local lymph node assay, and the ability to evaluate effectively the relative skin sensitizing potency of contact allergens, a model for Quantitative-Risk-Assessment (QRA) has been developed. This QRA process comprises: (a) determination of a No-Expected-Sensitisation-Induction-Level (NESIL), (b) incorporation of Sensitization-Assessment-Factors (SAFs) reflecting variations between subjects, product use patterns and matrices, and (c) estimation of Consumer-Exposure-Level (CEL). Based on these elements an Acceptable-Exposure-Level (AEL) can be calculated by dividing the NESIL of the product by individual SAFs. Finally, the AEL is compared with the CEL to judge about risks to human health. We propose a simplified approach to risk assessment of hair dye ingredients by making use of precise experimental product exposure data. This data set provides firmly established dose/unit area concentrations under relevant consumer use conditions referred to as the Measured-Exposure-Level (MEL). For that reason a direct comparison is possible between the NESIL with the MEL as a proof-of-concept quantification of the risk of skin sensitization. This is illustrated here by reference to two specific hair dye ingredients p-phenylenediamine and resorcinol. Comparison of these robust and toxicologically relevant values is therefore considered an improvement versus a hazard-based classification of hair dye ingredients.

Maternal Perception of Reduced Fetal Movements Is Associated with Altered Placental Structure and Function
BACKGROUND: Maternal perception of reduced fetal movement (RFM) is associated with increased risk of stillbirth and fetal growth restriction (FGR). DFM is thought to represent fetal compensation to conserve energy due to insufficient oxygen and nutrient transfer resulting from placental insufficiency. To date there have been no studies of placental structure in cases of DFM. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether maternal perception of reduced fetal movements (RFM) is associated with abnormalities in placental structure and function. DESIGN: Placentas were collected from women with RFM after 28 weeks gestation if delivery occurred within 1 week. Women with normal movements served as a control group. Placentas were weighed and photographs taken. Microscopic structure was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining and image analysis. System A amino acid transporter activity was measured as a marker of placental function. Placentas from all pregnancies with RFM (irrespective of outcome) had greater area with signs of infarction (3.5% vs. 0.6%; p<0.01), a higher density of syncytial knots (p<0.001) and greater proliferation index (p<0.01). Villous vascularity (p<0.001), trophoblast area (p<0.01) and system A activity (p<0.01) were decreased in placentas from RFM compared to controls irrespective of outcome of pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of abnormal placental morphology and function in women with RFM and supports the proposition of a causal association between placental insufficiency and RFM. This suggests that women presenting with RFM require further investigation to identify those with placental insufficiency.

Large scale potential vorticity anomalies and deep convection.
The effect on deep convection of large-scale potential vorticity (PV) anomalies and their associated tropospheric stable layers is complex and not well understood. This article examines the meteorological events of 9 July 2007 (IOP7b of the Convective and Orographically-induced Precipitation Study (COPS)), which was dominated by an upper-level PV anomaly that stretched from the UK to southern France and as far northeast as Denmark. Three precipitation regions were identified from the case: lines of intense storms beneath the PV anomaly; less intense, more widespread convective precipitation to the east of the PV anomaly; and, in between, a region of no precipitation. The latter of these coincided with the high-resolution measurements andmodel analyses from COPS. The extensive and varied data analyzed in this investigation show that convective available potential energy (CAPE) was present in this region (the distribution of CAPE and convective inhibition (CIN) is presented via an innovative, pseudo-3D visualization that allows horizontal and vertical interactions to be considered). However, convection was capped by a complex arrangement of dry layers; the base of the key layer was at 750 hPa. These dry layers descended separately from the upper troposphere, moving around the PV anomaly as it developed from a breaking Rossby wave to the west during the seven days before the IOP. This case adds to other studies that show that descent of complex dry layers is an important mechanism for forming convection-inhibiting atmospheric lids in Western Europe. A simple conceptual model is developed that synthesizes the effect of large-scale PV anomalies on deep convection from a series of consistent case studies. This model has significant implications for storm forecasting and projections of storminess in future climates, as it highlights the importance of thin structures that can advect hundreds of km before having an impact.

Metabolic reprogramming and two-compartment tumor metabolism: opposing role(s) of HIF1α and HIF2α in tumor-associated fibroblasts and human breast cancer cells.
Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1α and 2α are transcription factors responsible for the cellular response to hypoxia. The functional roles of HIF1α and HIF2α in cancer are distinct and vary among different tumor types. The aim of this study was to evaluate the compartment-specific role(s) of HIF1α and HIF2α in breast cancer. To this end, immortalized human fibroblasts and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells carrying constitutively active HIF1α or HIF2α mutants were analyzed with respect to their metabolic function(s) and ability to promote tumor growth in an in vivo setting. We observed that activation of HIF1α, but not HIF2α, in stromal cells promotes a shift toward aerobic glycolysis, with increased L-lactate production and a loss of mitochondrial activity. In a xenograft model, HIF1α-activated fibroblasts promoted the tumor growth of co-injected MDA-MB-231 cells without an increase in angiogenesis. Conversely, HIF2α-activated stromal cells did not favor tumor growth and behaved as the empty vector controls. Similarly, activation of HIF1α, but not HIF2α, in MDA-MB-231 cells promoted a shift toward aerobic glycolysis, with increased glucose uptake and L-lactate production. In contrast, HIF2α activation in cancer cells increased the expression of EGFR, Ras and cyclin D1, which are known markers of tumor growth and cell cycle progression. In a xenograft model, HIF1α activation in MDA-MB-231 cells acted as a tumor suppressor, resulting in an almost 2-fold reduction in tumor mass and volume. Interestingly, HIF2α activation in MDA-MB-231 cells induced a significant ~2-fold-increase in tumor mass and volume. Analysis of mitochondrial activity in these tumor xenografts using COX (cytochrome C oxidase) staining demonstrated elevated mitochondrial oxidative metabolism (OXPHOS) in HIF2α-tumors. We conclude that the role(s) of HIF1α and HIF2α in tumorigenesis are compartment-specific. HIF1α acts as a tumor promoter in stromal cells but as a tumor suppressor in cancer cells. Conversely, HIF2α is a tumor promoter in cancer cells. Mechanistically, HIF1α-driven aerobic glycolysis in stromal cells supports cancer cell growth via the paracrine production of nutrients (such as L-lactate) that can "feed" cancer cells. However, HIF1α-driven aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells inhibits tumor growth. Finally, HIF2α activation in cancer cells induces the expression of known pro-oncogenic molecules and promotes the mitochondrial activity of cancer cells.

The Combined Effect of Process Variations and Power Supply Noise on Clock Skew and Jitter
In modern VLSI circuits, a large number of clock buffers are inserted in clock distribution networks, which are significantly affected by process and power supply noise variations. The combined effect of process variations and power supply noise on clock skew and jitter is investigated in this paper. A statistical model of skitter, which consists of skew and jitter, is proposed. Clock paths with different buffer insertion strategies are compared in terms of skew and jitter. The tradeoffs among the constraints on clock jitter, skew, slew rate, and power are discussed. For strict timing constraints, severe power overhead (≥110%) has to be added to obtain a low improvement in the worst case skitter and slew rate (≤13%). The effect of widely-used techniques, such as recombinant trees and dynamic voltage scaling, on decreasing skitter is also investigated.

[rubrum, cryptophyte, bay, chesapeake, abundance]

Seasonal dynamics of Mesodinium rubrum in Chesapeake Bay
The photosynthetic ciliate Mesodinium rubrum is a common member of coastal phytoplankton communities that is well adapted to low-light, turbid ecosystems. It supports the growth of or competes with harmful dinoflagellate species for cryptophyte prey, as well as being a trophic link to copepods and larval fish. We have compiled data from various sources (n = 1063), on the abundance and distribution of M. rubrum in Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Because M. rubrum relies on obtaining
organelles from cryptophyte algae to maintain rapid growth, we also enumerated cryptophyte algae in the portion of these samples that we collected (n = 386). M. rubrum occurred in oligohaline to polyhaline regions of Chesapeake Bay and throughout the year. Blooms (>100 cells ml-1) of M. rubrum primarily occurred during spring, followed by autumn. When compared across all seasons, M. rubrum abundance was positively correlated to temperature and cryptophytes, and negatively correlated with salinity. However, more focused analyses revealed that M. rubrum abundance during spring was associated with surface layer warming and decreased salinity, while early autumn assemblages were associated with surface cooling. These results imply there are distinct seasonal niches for M. rubrum blooms. Blooms of M. rubrum were more common in tributaries than in the main stem Bay and tended to be restricted to salinities under 10 PSU. Despite the rarity of “red water” events, M. rubrum is a ubiquitous mixotroph in Chesapeake Bay and at times likely exerts a strong influence on cryptophyte algal abundance and hence planktonic food web structure.Author Posting. © The Author(s), 2013.

Simulation and theory of hybrid aligned liquid crystal films
<p>We present a study of the effects of nano-confinement on a system of hard Gaussian overlap particles interacting with planar substrates through the hard-needle–wall potential, extending earlier work by two of us D. J. Cleaver and P. I. C. Teixeira, Chem. Phys. Lett. 338, 1 (2001). Here, we consider the case of hybrid films, where one of the substrates induces strongly homeotropic anchoring while the other favours either weakly homeotropic or planar anchoring. These systems are investigated using both Monte Carlo simulation and density-functional theory, the latter implemented at the level of Onsager’s second virial approximation with Parsons-Lee rescaling. The orientational structure is found to change either continuously or discontinuously depending on substrate separation, in agreement with earlier predictions by others. Theory is seen to perform well in spite of its simplicity, predicting the positional and orientational structure seen in simulations even for small particle elongations.</p>

ChIP-seq guidelines and practices of the ENCODE and modENCODE consortia
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by high-throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) has become a valuable and widely used approach for mapping the genomic location of transcription-factor binding and histone modifications in living cells. Despite its widespread use, there are considerable differences in how these experiments are conducted, how the results are scored and evaluated for quality, and how the data and metadata are archived for public use. These practices affect the quality and utility of any global ChIP experiment. Through our experience in performing ChIP-seq experiments, the ENCODE and modENCODE consortia have developed a set of working standards and guidelines for ChIP experiments that are updated routinely. The current guidelines address antibody validation, experimental replication, sequencing depth, data and metadata reporting, and data quality assessment. We discuss how ChIP quality, assessed in these ways, affects different uses of ChIP-seq data. All data sets used in the analysis have been deposited for public viewing and downloading at the ENCODE (http://encodeproject.org/ENCODE/) and modENCODE (http://www.modencode.org/) portals.

Beta1 integrin antisense oligodeoxynucleotides: utility in controlling osteoclast function.
The involvement of beta1 integrins in osteoclast function has been investigated by utilising an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) approach. 18-mer antisense and control phosphorothioate ODNs were made to a conserved internal region of beta1 integrin sequence (nucleotide positions 1634-1651 of the human beta1 fibronectin receptor). These were tested on rabbit osteoclasts for anti-adhesive and resorptive effects mediated by alphaVbeta3 and alpha2beta1, the major integrins of osteoclasts. Antisense, but not control, beta1 ODNs inhibited osteoclast adhesion to collagen-coated glass (by up to 70%), but not to glass coated with vitronectin, fibronectin or fibrinogen. Adhesion to dentine and subsequent resorption were also inhibited (up to 60%) in a sequence-specific manner. The mechanism of action was verified using both a melanoma cell line, DX3, which expresses multiple integrins at high level including alphaVbeta3 and alpha2beta1, and in a rabbit osteoclast marrow culture (BMC) system. Exposure of DX3 cells to antisense ODN for up to 48 hours reduced adhesion to FCS- and collagen-coated glass, and concomitantly inhibited beta1 protein expression assessed by FACS and Western blot analysis; expression of other integrin subunits, alphaV and beta3, was unaffected. Similarly, the beta1 protein levels in the BMC were reduced by > 75% without any effect on actin expression. These data reveal the utility of antisense ODNs in exploring osteoclast biology and further define the functional role of osteoclastic beta1 integrin(s).

Exploring the application of mesenchymal stem cells in bone repair and regeneration.
Failure of bone repair is a challenging problem in the management of fractures. There is a limited supply of autologous bone grafts for treating nonunions, with associated morbidity after harvesting. There is need for a better source of cells for repair. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) hold promise for healing of bone because of their capacity to differentiate into osteoblasts and their availability from a wide variety of sources. Our review aims to evaluate the available clinical evidence and recent progress in strategies which attempt to use autologous and heterologous MSCs in clinical practice, including genetically-modified MSCs and those grown on scaffolds. We have compared various procedures for isolating and expanding a sufficient number of MSCs for use in a clinical setting. There are now a number of clinical studies which have shown that implantation of MSCs is an effective, safe and durable method for aiding the repair and regeneration of bone.

[cell, nanog, pluripotency, condition, culture, reprogramming, kinase, naive]

Nanog overcomes reprogramming barriers and induces pluripotency in minimal conditions.
Induced pluripotency requires the expression of defined factors and culture conditions that support the self-renewal of embryonic stem (ES) cells. Small molecule inhibition of MAP kinase (MEK) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) with LIF (2i/LIF) provides an optimal culture environment for mouse ES cells and promotes transition to naive pluripotency in partially reprogrammed (pre-iPS) cells. Here we show that 2i/LIF treatment in clonal lines of pre-iPS cells results in the activation of endogenous Nanog and rapid downregulation of retroviral Oct4 expression. Nanog enables somatic cell reprogramming in serum-free medium supplemented with LIF, a culture condition which does not support induced pluripotency or the self-renewal of ES cells, and is sufficient to reprogram epiblast-derived stem cells to naive pluripotency in serum-free medium alone. Nanog also enhances reprogramming in cooperation with kinase inhibition or 5-aza-cytidine, a small molecule inhibitor of DNA methylation. These results highlight the capacity of Nanog to overcome multiple barriers to reprogramming and reveal a synergy between Nanog and chemical inhibitors that promote reprogramming. We conclude that Nanog induces pluripotency in minimal conditions. This provides a strategy for imposing naive pluripotency in mammalian cells independently of species-specific culture requirements.

[pain, crp, participant, knee, obesity]

Obesity is a risk factor for musculoskeletal pain in adolescents: Findings from a population-based cohort.
Obesity is a risk factor for fibromyalgia in adults, but whether a similar relationship exists in children is uncertain. This study examined whether obesity is associated with reporting of musculoskeletal pain, including chronic regional pain (CRP) and chronic widespread pain (CWP), in adolescents, in a population-based setting. A pain questionnaire was administered to offspring of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children at age 17, asking about site, duration, and pain intensity, from which participants with different types of musculoskeletal pain were identified. Relationships between obesity and pain were examined by calculating odds ratios stratified by gender and adjusted for socioeconomic status as reflected by level of maternal education. A total of 3376 participants (1424 boys) with complete data were identified, mean age 17.8; 44.7% of participants reported any pain within the last month lasting 1day or longer; 16.3% reported lower back pain, 9.6% shoulder pain, 9.4% upper back pain, 8.9% neck pain, 8.7% knee pain, 6.8% ankle/foot pain, 4.7% CRP, and 4.3% CWP; 7.0% of participants were obese. Obesity was associated with increased odds of any pain (odds ratio OR 1.33, P=.04), CRP (OR 2.04, P=.005), and knee pain (OR 1.87, P=.001), but not CWP (OR 1.10, P=.5). Compared with non obese participants, those with any pain, knee pain, and CRP reported more severe average pain (P<.01). Obese adolescents were more likely to report musculoskeletal pain, including knee pain and CRP. Moreover, obese adolescents with knee pain and CRP had relatively high pain scores, suggesting a more severe phenotype with worse prognosis.

Nerve injury and the laryngeal mask airway.
The laryngeal mask airway is a widely used, non-invasive, general purpose airway. We report the case of a temporary vocal cord palsy following the use of such an airway. The development of inappropriately high cuff pressures secondary to nitrous oxide diffusion into the cuff is proposed as the most likely cause. Knowledge of the existence of nerve injuries complicating laryngeal mask use is particularly important when counselling certain patients. Mandatory intraoperative cuff pressure monitoring should lower the risk of subsequent voice problems.

Ketoconazole pharmacokinetics during chronic dosing in adults with haematological malignancy.
Ketoconazole pharmacokinetics were determined in nine adults with haematological malignancy after one week on a 200 mg daily dose and later after one week on a 400 mg daily dose. The area under the serum concentration time curve (AUC) reached 12.3 +/- 7.7 mg/l.h (mean +/- S.D.) on the 200 mg dose and increased to 23.0 +/- 18.2 mg/l.h on the 400 mg dose (p less than 0.05). The half-life of ketoconazole was 3.1 +/- 1.9 h on the 200 mg dose and 3.5 +/- 1.7 h on the 400 mg dose. Peak concentrations were 3.2 +/- 1.8 mg/l and 4.6 +/- 3.2 mg/l on the 200 mg and 400 mg doses, respectively. Trough ketoconazole concentrations were undetectable 24 h after either dose. There was no correlation between the leucocyte count and any pharmacokinetic parameter for ketoconazole. Variation in AUC was 20-fold on the 200 mg daily dose and 8-fold on the 400 mg per day regimen. Measurement of serum levels during ketoconazole treatment appears necessary in view of the unpredictable concentrations achieved. Once-a-day dosage regimens of ketoconazole in immunocompromised patients may be inappropriate. Future clinical trials should adopt a two or three times a day dosing regimen, as this may confer a pharmacokinetic and therapeutic advantage.

Molecular Basis of Bacterial Formaldehyde Sensing
Formaldehyde is a highly toxic molecule; despite this, it is produced in the cells of all living organisms as a by-product of metabolic pathways. Consequently, several pathways have evolved throughout life in order to detoxify cellular formaldehyde. These pathways need to be regulated within the cell and this study sets out to determine how these pathways are regulated in particular bacteria. Several approaches are taken to achieve this. Known or predicted transcription factors that regulate formaldehyde detoxification pathways from particular organisms are considered. These proteins are called FrmR (E. coli), HxlR1 (Bacillus subtilis), and HxlR2 (Bacillus Cereus). The transcription factors are cloned and purified using molecular biology techniques. The proteins are subject to biophysical characterisation i.e. size and secondary structure composition. Additionally, the X-ray crystal structure of HxlR2 is determined and significant progress is made towards determining the structure of FrmR. Interactions of these transcription factors towards their target DNA sequences are studied along with the effect that formaldehyde has on these interactions. A reporter system is constructed that enables the behaviour of FrmR to be studied in vivo. Residues that are likely to play important roles in DNA recognition by this regulator are identified. Additionally, this reporter system identifies a residue that is essential for formaldehyde sensing by this protein. Overall, some significant insights into how these transcription factors carry out their biological function are established.

Reactivity of measurement in health psychology: how much of a problem is it? What can be done about it?
PURPOSE: Measurement reactivity is defined as being present where measurement results in changes in the people being measured. The main aim of this review is to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge concerning the extent and nature of psychological measurement affecting people who complete the measures. Other aims are to describe how this may affect conclusions drawn in health psychology research and to outline where more research is needed. METHODS: Narrative review. RESULTS: Several studies, using a variety of methods, have found measurement procedures to alter subsequent cognition, emotion, and behaviour. In many instances, the effects obtained were of up to medium size. However, the extent to which such studies are representative is not clear: do other studies which find no reactive effects of measurement not exist or do they exist but are not reported? CONCLUSIONS: Although measurement reactivity can yield medium-sized effects, our understanding of this phenomenon is still rudimentary. We do not know the precise circumstances that are likely to result in measurement reactivity: we cannot predict when problems are more likely to arise. There is a particular absence of studies of the mechanisms by which measurement reactivity arises. There is a need for a systematic review of this literature, which should aim to quantify the extent of measurement reactivity effects and to provide a firmer evidence base for theorizing about the sources of reactivity.

TOMOGRAPHY IMAGING BASED ON PLASTIC OPTICAL FIBRE
Abstract of thesis submitted by Nurgiyatna Nurgiyatna for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) entitled ‘Tomography Imaging Based on Plastic Optical Fibre’, January 2013.Plastic optical fibres (POF) can be made sensitive to various parameters. Therefore, a successful implementation of tomographic imaging based on POF sensors will open the way to develop imagers for various parameters utilising this inexpensive sensor material.  The work reported in this thesis is aiming to implement real time tomographic imaging based on the POF sensor. As the system uses light (photons) guided along the sensor to capture the information and deliver a signal at the periphery of the sensor, this technique is referred to as Photonic Guided Path Tomography (PGPT). As an initial stage of the work, we perform systematic testing of the sensitivity of POF transmission to bending. The results confirm that grooving can enhance this sensitivity of the POF sensor. They also provide an empirical proof of the anticipated changes in transmission loss by positive and negative bending for grooved POF (opening and closing of grooves respectively). We show that small positive bending increases the power loss, while for negative bending the power loss experiences a minimum, corresponding to the best achievable waveguiding recovery because of the closing of grooves. Beyond certain deformation, the sensitivity of the POF sensor is dominated by losses in the un-grooved regions. A bending test for the mechanical integrity of grooved POFs shows that repetitive bending to a small radius results in a quick deterioration depending on the depth of the groove. However for bending radii more than 20mm and groove depths up to 0.3mm, the lifetime of the POF sensor is still acceptable for many targeted sensor application.While it is clear that the grooved POF is more sensitive to small bending compared to the un-grooved POF, the latter offers uncompromised mechanical integrity and is more desirable when the highest possible sensitivity is not a priority. Therefore, in the final stage of the work, both grooved and un-grooved POF are considered as candidates for developing the tomographic imaging modality. Further detail is considered in view of the targeted deliverable, a real PGPT system for footstep imaging, based on POF sensors. This has been successfully achieved by designing, integrating and testing two different PGPT systems: one based on grooved POF with sensor head size of 0.9m x 0.9m incorporating a multiplexed photodetector and another based on un-grooved POF with sensor head size of 2m x 1m, incorporating independent POF sensors. Both are capable of performing the real time imaging task as well as storing the numerical data for alternative processing. The image reconstruction is by applying a median-filtered Landweber method to solve the inverse tomography problem. The frame rate achieved is 2Hz and 1Hz with spatial resolution estimated as 10cm and 3cm for the first and second system respectively

An investigation of rheumatoid arthritis loci in patients with early-onset psoriasis validates association of the REL gene.
Background  Phenotypically diverse autoimmune conditions share common genetic susceptibility loci and underlying molecular pathways. Objectives  By systematically searching for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with another autoimmune disease, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we aimed to elucidate novel genetic markers of psoriasis. Methods  We investigated 18 SNPs, previously confirmed as being associated with RA, in a U.K. cohort of 623 patients with early-onset psoriasis (presenting before age 40 years), comparing them with 2662 control subjects. Results  Our findings confirm the association of early-onset psoriasis with REL (rs13031237, P = 0·0027). The minor allele of REL had opposing effects upon susceptibility to disease in patients with psoriasis and RA. Conclusion  Similar exploration of additional autoimmune loci and fine mapping of such regions may provide further insight into the genetics and molecular pathophysiology of psoriasis.

The in-vitro potency and selectivity, in-vivo binding affinity and effect of the 5-HT(6)R antagonist Lu AE58054 (2-(6-fluoro-1H-indol-3-yl)-ethyl-3-(2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropoxy)-benzyl-amine) on impaired cognition were evaluated. Lu AE58054 displayed high affinity to the human 5-HT(6) receptor (5-HT(6)R) with a Ki of 0.83 nm. In a 5-HT(6) GTPgammaS efficacy assay Lu AE58054 showed no agonist activity, but demonstrated potent inhibition of 5-HT-mediated activation. Besides medium affinity to adrenergic alpha(1A)- and alpha(1B)-adrenoreceptors, Lu AE58054 demonstrated >50-fold selectivity for more than 70 targets examined. Orally administered Lu AE58054 potently inhibited striatal in-vivo binding of the 5-HT(6) antagonist radioligand (3)HLu AE60157 ((3)H8-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-3-phenylsulfonylquinoline), with an ED(50) of 2.7 mg/kg. Steady-state modelling of an acute pharmacokinetic/5-HT(6)R occupancy time-course experiment indicated a plasma EC(50) value of 20 ng/ml. Administration of Lu AE58054 in a dose range (5-20 mg/kg p.o.) leading to above 65% striatal 5-HT(6)R binding occupancy in vivo, reversed cognitive impairment in a rat novel object recognition task induced after subchronic treatment for 7 d with phencyclidine (PCP 2 mg/kg b.i.d., i.p. for 7 d, followed by 7 d drug free). The results indicate that Lu AE58054 is a selective antagonist of 5-HT(6)Rs with good oral bioavailability and robust efficacy in a rat model of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. Lu AE58054 may be useful for the pharmacotherapy of cognitive dysfunction in disease states such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease.

Abdominal ultrasound was performed in conjunction with liver function tests in 38 patients with small bowel Crohn's disease and a similar number of age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Five (13%) patients had had previous cholecystectomies for cholelithiasis, and eight (21%) were found to have gallstones on ultrasound. Thus, a total of 34% of patients as compared with 8% of controls had gallstones (P less than 0.01). Compared with 8% of controls, 53% of patients had evidence of at least one biochemical or ultrasonic hepatobiliary abnormality (P less than 0.001). A bright liver echo pattern may be indicative of portal triaditis. The high prevalence of gallstones in Crohn's disease should be considered in any patient who continues to complain of abdominal pain despite otherwise appearing to be in remission.

Distinct clinical and pathological characteristics of frontotemporal dementia associated with C9ORF72 mutations.
The identification of a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9ORF72 gene as the cause of chromosome 9-linked frontotemporal dementia and motor neuron disease offers the opportunity for greater understanding of the relationship between these disorders and other clinical forms of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. In this study, we screened a cohort of 398 patients with frontotemporal dementia, progressive non-fluent aphasia, semantic dementia or mixture of these syndromes for mutations in the C9ORF72 gene. Motor neuron disease was present in 55 patients (14%). We identified 32 patients with C9ORF72 mutations, representing 8% of the cohort. The patients' clinical phenotype at presentation varied: nine patients had frontotemporal dementia with motor neuron disease, 19 had frontotemporal dementia alone, one had mixed semantic dementia with frontal features and three had progressive non-fluent aphasia. There was, as expected, a significant association between C9ORF72 mutations and presence of motor neuron disease. Nevertheless, 46 patients, including 22 familial, had motor neuron disease but no mutation in C9ORF72. Thirty-eight per cent of the patients with C9ORF72 mutations presented with psychosis, with a further 28% exhibiting paranoid, deluded or irrational thinking, whereas <4% of non-mutation bearers presented similarly. The presence of psychosis dramatically increased the odds that patients carried the mutation. Mutation bearers showed a low incidence of motor stereotypies, and relatively high incidence of complex repetitive behaviours, largely linked to patients' delusions. They also showed a lower incidence of acquired sweet food preference than patients without C9ORF72 mutations. Post-mortem pathology in five patients revealed transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 pathology, type A in one patient and type B in three. However, one patient had corticobasal degeneration pathology. The findings indicate that C9ORF72 mutations cause some but not all cases of frontotemporal dementia with motor neuron disease. Other mutations remain to be discovered. C9ORF72 mutations are associated with variable clinical presentations and pathology. Nevertheless, the findings highlight a powerful association between C9ORF72 mutations and psychosis and suggest that the behavioural characteristics of patients with C9ORF72 mutations are qualitatively distinct. Mutations in the C9ORF72 gene may be a major cause not only of frontotemporal dementia with motor neuron disease but also of late onset psychosis.

How can the concepts of habitus and field help us to understand the engagement of educational workers in higher Education?
In ‘Making a European area of lifelong learning a reality’, the EU stressed the role of universities in relation to lifelong learning, a role that entails a need for widening access to universities, particularly for those not coming through the traditional direct route of upper secondary education. As teachers play a significant role in the quality of the lifelong learning as well as in motivating future generations to take part in lifelong learning, education and training for teachers becomes important; not only in relation to initial teacher education, but also in relation to a continuous development of knowledge and skills. 
This paper represents the first stage of a larger comparative project intended to examine and compare educational workers’ (i.e. professionals involved in teaching in the class room) participation in higher education in England and Denmark, their access and interest. In particular, the paper relates participation and engagement to national and international educational policies and frames this work within an examination of the social background of the professional groups. The key research questions at this stage of the work are methodological and can be summed up by the overarching question, “How can the concepts of habitus and field help us to understand levels of engagement of educational workers in Higher Education”?
The paper reports the results of our review of current policies and our efforts to identify the structural relations within the educational professional fields in each country. To do so we are developing a theoretical model using the relational analytical approach advocated by Bourdieu. As such, our work is an early stage attempt at operationalising Bourdieu’s observations regarding the dynamics of field. This seems to us to provide an important conceptual approach to understanding the habitus of educational workers in the context of the dynamics of a fast changing policy arena and the complexities of the backgrounds of individuals working in the educational field. The model attempts to build in the reflexivity that Bourdieu demands for a ‘science’ that is not weakened by over-emphasis on either the objective structural relations or the subjective phenomenology of experience. 
Thus, the paper presents a preliminary contextual analysis of the factors that enable an understanding of engagement or lack of engagement in higher level learning among school-based education workers in the two EU countries and is related to a larger research project that explores habitus (both individual and collective) among these groups of education workers.

[behaviour, prototype, variable, tpb, intention, predictive, pwm, actor, validity, abstainer]

Augmenting the theory of planned behaviour with the prototype/willingness model: predictive validity of actor versus abstainer prototypes for adolescents' health-protective and health-risk intentions.
OBJECTIVES: The present research tested: (a) whether prototype perceptions and descriptive norms from the prototype/willingness model (PWM; Gibbons, Gerrard, Blanton, & Russell, 1998) enhance the prediction of adolescents' intentions to engage in health-protective and health-risk behaviours after variables from the theory of planned behaviour (TPB; Ajzen, 1991) and past behaviour have been taken into account and (b) whether images of the type of person who engages in a health behaviour (actor prototypes) and images of the type of person who does not engage in a health behaviour (abstainer prototypes) have equivalent predictive validity. DESIGN: An experimental design with a single between participants factor (actor versus abstainer prototype) was employed. METHOD: Participants in this study were 247 school pupils who completed measures of TPB variables, PWM variables and past behaviour in relation to three health-protective and three health-risk behaviours. RESULTS: Findings indicated that PWM variables accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in behavioural intentions after TPB variables and past behaviour had been taken into account (Mean deltaR2=.05). Perceived similarity to prototypes was the most consistent additional predictor of intention. Actor and abstainer prototypes exhibited equivalent predictive validity. CONCLUSIONS: The present research suggests that variables from the PWM, especially prototype similarity, enhance the predictive validity of the TPB. The findings also provide new evidence that acquiring the characteristics of both health and risk images may be goals among adolescents and suggest that both healthy and risky prototypes constitute useful cognitive targets for interventions.

[cholesterol, dietary, plasma, ldl, weight, group, week, diet, egg, loss]

Increased dietary cholesterol does not increase plasma low density lipoprotein when accompanied by an energy-restricted diet and weight loss.
BACKGROUND: Diets enriched with dietary cholesterol, frequently from eggs, have been shown to produce a small but variable increase in plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. There is evidence to suggest that energy-restricted diets, that may contain a relatively high proportion of fat and cholesterol, can attenuate the cholesterol-raising effect of dietary cholesterol on plasma LDL. AIM OF THE STUDY: To determine the combined effects of increased dietary cholesterol and weight loss produced by energy restriction on plasma LDL cholesterol and lipoproteins. METHODS: A randomized, controlled, parallel study was performed in two groups of free-living volunteers on an energy-restricted diet for 12 weeks, one group was instructed to consume two eggs a day (n = 24), the other, to exclude eggs (n = 21). Dietary advice on energy restriction was based on the British Heart Foundation guidelines on how to lose weight for men and women. RESULTS: Energy intake fell by 25 and 29% in the egg-fed and non-egg-fed groups, resulting in a moderate weight loss of 3.4 kg (P < 0.05) and 4.4 kg (P < 0.05), respectively. The daily intake of dietary cholesterol increased significantly in the egg-fed group from 278 to 582 mg after 6 weeks. The concentration of plasma LDL cholesterol decreased in the non-egg-fed groups after 6 weeks (P < 0.01) and in the egg-fed and non-egg-fed at 12 weeks relative to baseline. There were no other significant changes in plasma lipoproteins or LDL particle size. CONCLUSIONS: An increased intake of dietary cholesterol from two eggs a day, does not increase total plasma or LDL cholesterol when accompanied by moderate weight loss. These findings suggest that cholesterol-rich foods should not be excluded from dietary advice to lose weight on account of an unfavorable influence on plasma LDL cholesterol.

[post-stroke, immunodepression, response, stroke, immune, infection, mechanism]

Post-stroke immunodepression and infection: an emerging concept.
Infections occur commonly following stroke and adversely influence outcome. Dysphagia, greater stroke severity and increasing age are associated with post-stroke infection, but post-stroke immunodepression is now recognised as an independent factor associated with increased susceptibility. Counter-regulatory responses, triggered by the pro-inflammatory response to stroke, appear to effect systemic immunodepression via suppression of both innate and adaptive immune responses. Experimental and clinical studies have identified a range of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive changes, including reduced mononuclear phagocyte and natural killer cell function, induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines, apoptotic lymphocyte loss and altered T lymphocyte activity. A range of mechanisms has been proposed, including hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation. The post-stroke balance of pro- and anti- inflammatory mechanisms may be aimed at restricting the extent of inflammation and contributing to the restoration of immune homeostasis. However, severe inflammation in the brain may trigger major systemic, counter-inflammatory responses that ultimately compromise immune mechanisms required to combat pathogens. Although key pathways have been identified, the extent to which the various elements of post-stroke immunodepression are clinically relevant remains to be discovered. The identification of markers of immunodepression in the early post-stroke phase may prove useful for identifying patients that may have increased susceptibility to infection. It also seems likely that post-stroke immunodepression will need to be taken into account where stroke treatments impact upon inflammatory and immune pathways.

[cancer, treatment, radiation, pathway]

Nutrient restriction and radiation therapy for cancer treatment: when less is more.
Calorie restriction (CR), or a diet modification aiming to reduce the total intake of calories by 20%-40%, has been shown to increase longevity across multiple species. Recently, there has been growing interest in investigating the potential role of CR as a treatment intervention for age-related diseases, such as cancer, because an increasing body of literature has demonstrated a metabolic component to both carcinogenesis and tumor progression. In fact, many of the molecular pathways that are altered with CR are also known to be altered in cancer. Therefore, manipulation of these pathways using CR can render cancer cells, and most notably breast cancer cells, more susceptible to standard cytotoxic treatment with radiation and chemotherapy. In this review article we demonstrate the laboratory and clinical evidence that exists for CR and show compelling evidence through the molecular pathways CR induces about how it may be used as a treatment in tandem with radiation therapy to improve our rates of disease control.

[brain, cell, transmigration, engraftment, hematopoietic]

Busulfan conditioning enhances engraftment of hematopoietic donor-derived cells in the brain compared with irradiation.
Hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy for neurological disorders relies on transmigration of donor-derived monocytes to the brain, where they can engraft as microglia and deliver therapeutic proteins. Many mouse studies use whole-body irradiation to investigate brain transmigration pathways, but chemotherapy is generally used clinically. The current evidence for transmigration to the brain after chemotherapy is conflicting. We compared hematopoietic donor cell brain engraftment after bone marrow (BM) transplants in busulfan- or irradiation-conditioned mice. Significantly more donor-derived microglial cells engrafted posttransplant in busulfan-conditioned brain compared with the irradiated, in both the short and long term. Although total Iba-1(+) microglial content was increased in irradiated brain in the short term, it was similar between groups over long-term engraftment. MCP-1, a key regulator of monocyte transmigration, showed long-term elevation in busulfan-conditioned brain, whereas irradiated brains showed long-term elevation of the proinflammatory chemokine interleukin 1α (IL-1α), with increased in situ proliferation of resident microglia, and significant increases in the relative number of amoeboid activated microglia in the brain. This has implications for the choice of conditioning regimen to promote hematopoietic cell brain engraftment and the relevance of irradiation in mouse models of transplantation.

Is multiple SNP testing in BRCA2 and BRCA1 female carriers ready for use in clinical practice? Results from a large Genetic Centre in the UK.
BRCA1 and BRCA2 are major breast cancer susceptibility genes. Nineteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 18 loci have been associated with breast cancer. We aimed to determine whether these predict breast cancer incidence in women with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations. BRCA1/2 mutation carriers identified through the Manchester genetics centre between 1996 and 2011 were included. Using published odds ratios (OR) and risk allele frequencies, we calculated an overall breast cancer risk SNP score (OBRS) for each woman. The relationship between OBRS and age at breast cancer onset was investigated using the Cox proportional hazards model, and predictive ability assessed using Harrell's C concordance statistic. In BRCA1 mutation carriers we found no association between OBRS and age at breast cancer onset: OR for the lowest risk quintile compared to the highest was 1.20 (95% CI 0.82-1.75, Harrell's C = 0.54), but in BRCA2 mutation carriers the association was significant (OR for the lowest risk quintile relative to the highest was 0.47 (95% CI 0.33-0.69, Harrell's C = 0.59). The 18 validated breast cancer SNPs differentiate breast cancer risks between women with BRCA2 mutations, but not BRCA1. It may now be appropriate to use these SNPs to help women with BRCA2 mutations make maximally informed decisions about management options.

[plume, mantle, anomaly, model, ridge, mba, bathymetric, temperature, variation, galapagos]

Mantle plume-midocean ridge interaction : geophysical observations and mantle dynamics
We analyze bathymetric and gravity anomalies at five plume-ridge systems to constrain
crustal and mantle density structure at these prominent oceanic features. Numerical models
are then used to explore the physical mechanisms controlling plume-ridge interaction and to
place theoretical constraints on the temperature anomalies, dimensions, and fluxes of the
Icelandic and Galapagos plumes.
In Chapter 1 we analyze bathymetric and gravity anomalies along the hotspot-influenced
Galapagos Spreading Center. We find that the Galapagos plume generates
along-axis bathymetric and mantle-Bouguer gravity anomalies (MBA) that extend >500 km
east and west of the Galapagos Islands. The along-axis MBA becomes increasingly
negative towards the plume center, reaching a minimum of ~-90 mGal near 91°W, and axial
topography shallows by ~1.1 km toward the plume. These variations in MBA and
bathymetry are attributed to the combined effects of crustal thickening and anomalously low
mantle densities, both of which are due to a mantle temperature anomaly imposed beneath
the ridge by the Galapagos plume. Passive mantle flow models predict a temperature
anomaly of 50±25°C is sufficient to produce the 2-4 km excess crust required to explain the
along-axis anomalies. 70-75% of the along-axis bathymetric and MBA variations are
estimated to arise from the crust with the remaining 25-30% generated by the anomalously
hot, thus low-density mantle. Along Cocos-plate isochrons, bathymetric and MBA
variations increase with increasing isochron age, suggesting the subaxial mantle
temperature anomaly was greater in the past when the plume was closer, to the ridge axis.
In addition to the Galapagos plume-ridge system, in Chapter 2 we examine alongisochron
bathymetric and MBA variations at four other plume-ridge systems associated
with the Iceland, Azores, Easter and Tristan hotspots. We show that residual bathymetry
(up to 4.7 km) and mantle-Bouguer gravity anomalies (up to -340 mGal) are greatest at on-axis
plumes and decreases with increasing ridge-hotspot separation distance, until
becoming insignificant at a plume-ridge separation of ~500 km. Along-isochron widths of
bathymetric anomalies (up to 2700 km) decrease with increasing paleo-spreading rate,
reflecting the extent to which plume material flows along-axis before being swept away by
the spreading lithosphere. Scaling arguments suggest an average ridgeward plume flux of
-2.2x106 km/my. Assuming that the amplitudes of the MBA and bathymetric anomalies
reflect crustal thickness and mantle density variations, passive mantle flow models predict maximum subaxial mantle temperature anomalies to be 150-225°C for ridge-center plumes,
which decrease as the ridges migrate away from the plumes.
The dynamics of mantle flow and melting at ridge-centered plumes are investigated in
Chapters 3 using three-dimensional, variable-viscosity, numerical models. Three
buoyancy sources are examined: temperature, melt depletion, and melt retention. The
width W to which a plume spreads along a ridge axis depends on plume volume flux Q,
full spreading rate U, buoyancy number B = (QΔρg)/(48η0U2), and ambient/plume
viscosity contrast ϒ according to W=2.37(Q/U)l/2(Bϒ)0.04. Thermal buoyancy is first
order in controlling along-axis plume spreading while latent heat loss due to melting, and
depletion and retention buoyancy forces contribute second order effects. Two end-member
models of the Iceland-Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) system are examined. The first endmember
model has a broad plume source of radius 300 km, temperature anomaly of 75°C,
and volume flux of 1.2xl07 km3/my. The second model has a narrower plume source of
radius 60 km, temperature anomaly of l70°C, and flux of 2.1 x106 km3/my. The first
model predicts successfully the observed crustal thickness, topographic, and MBA
variations along the MAR, but the second model requires substantial along-axis melt
transport in order to explain the observed along-axis variations in crustal thickness,
bathymetry, and gravity. We favor this second model because it predicts a mantle P-wave
velocity reduction in the plume of ~2% as consistent with recent seismic observations
beneath Iceland.
Finally in Chapter 4 we use three-dimensional numerical models to investigate the
interaction of plumes and migrating midocean ridges. Scaling laws of axial plume
spreading width Ware derived first for stationary ridges and off-axis plumes, which yield
results consistent with those obtained from independent studies of Ribe 1996. Wand the
maximum plume-ridge interaction distance Xmax again scale with (Q/U)l/2 as in the case of
ridge-centered plumes and increase with ϒ and buoyancy number. In the case of a
migrating ridge, Xmax is reduced when a ridge migrates toward the plume due to excess
drag of the faster-moving leading plate, and enhanced when a ridge migrates away from the
plume due to reduced drag of the slower-moving trailing plate. Thermal erosion of the
lithospheric boundary layer by the previously ridge-centered plume further enhances Wand
Xmax but to a degree that is secondary to the differential migration rates of the two plates.
Model predictions are compared with observed along-isochron bathymetric and MBA
variations at the Galapagos plume-ridge system. The anomaly amplitudes and widths, as
well as the increase in anomaly amplitude with age are predicted with a plume source
temperature anomaly of 80-120°C, radius of 80-100 km, and volume flux of 4.5x106
km3/m.y. Our numerical models also predict crustal production rates of the Galapagos
Islands consistent with those estimated independently using the observed island
topography. Predictions of the geochemical signature of the plume along the present-day
ridge suggest that mixing between the plume and ambient mantle sources is unlikely to
occur in the asthenosphere or shallow crust, but most likely deeper in the mantle possibly
by entrainment of ambient mantle as the plume ascends through the depleted portion of the
mantle from its deep source reservoir.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution September 199

[ulcer, leg, therapy, venous, patient, people, larval, study, participant]

Patients' perceptions and experiences of venous leg ulceration and their attitudes to larval therapy: an in-depth qualitative study.
BACKGROUND: Venous leg ulcers are a common and distressing condition that can impair quality of life. Larval therapy has been widely promoted for the treatment of different types of chronic wounds, yet little is known about its acceptability to patients. OBJECTIVES: To explore patients' experiences of venous leg ulceration and of the acceptability of larval therapy as a treatment. DESIGN: Qualitative study, using semi-structured interviews alongside a randomized controlled trial. Interview data were transcribed and analysed for thematic content. Data were collected from April 2007 to July 2007. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen people (12 men, 6 women), aged between 29 and 93 years (median age 64 years), with at least one venous leg ulcer, took part in the study. Fourteen people were recruited from two vascular clinics (one attached to a hospital and the other located in a community setting). A further four people were recruited through referral from a team of community nurses. FINDINGS: Participants portrayed lives blighted by the presence of one or more leg ulcers. The majority were willing to try 'maggots' (larvae) and able to overcome feelings of squeamishness because of their strong desire to heal their ulcers. Five people treated with larvae were included in the study. Initial improvements in the condition of their ulcers were not sustained, and two participants experienced severe pain. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Patients may hold unrealistic expectations that larval therapy will effect a longed-for cure for their leg ulcer(s) but an absence of healing may lead to feelings of disappointment or despair.

[relative, patient, control, behavioural, behaviour, recent-onset, psychosis, direct]

Expressed emotion, types of behavioural control and controllability attributions in relatives of people with recent-onset psychosis.
PURPOSE: High expressed emotion (high-EE), as compared with low-EE, relatives of patients with long-term psychosis may behave in a more controlling manner towards patients. Furthermore, higher levels of behavioural control have been associated with higher relapse rates. We investigated in a recent-onset sample, the extent to which high-EE relatives engage in controlling behaviours and attribute the patient's illness to factors within patient's control. Furthermore, we examined whether criticism/hostility and emotional overinvolvement (EOI) were, respectively, associated with two types of behavioural control (termed 'direct influencing' and 'buffering'). We also investigated if controlling behaviours or attributions were better relapse predictors than EE. METHOD: Measures of EE, controllability attributions and behavioural control and its subtypes ('direct influencing' and 'buffering') were derived from Camberwell Family Interviews with 80 relatives of recent-onset psychosis patients. 'Direct influencing' attempts denote any behaviour intending to coerce the patient; while 'buffering' attempts refer to any behaviour aiming to take control or do things for the patient. RESULTS: High-EE relatives perceived patients as having more control over their illness and were more inclined to attempt to control patients' behaviour than low-EE relatives. Furthermore, high-EE-critical relatives used more direct influencing attempts, and high-EE-EOI relatives used more buffering attempts, but behavioural control was not associated with relapse in this recent-onset sample. CONCLUSIONS: These findings may help us to understand the development of EE in recent-onset psychosis families. Acknowledging and integrating relatives' attributional and behavioural patterns in designing and delivering clinical and familial early interventions should prove beneficial in meeting the needs of this specific population.

[bag-1, expression, chondrocyte, gene, cell, ossification, endochondral, role]

Bcl-2-associated athanogene-1 (BAG-1): a transcriptional regulator mediating chondrocyte survival and differentiation during endochondral ossification.
BAG-1, an anti-apoptotic protein, was identified by its ability to bind to BCL-2, HSP70-family molecular chaperones and nuclear hormone receptor family members. Two BAG-1 isoforms, BAG-1L (50 kDa) and BAG-1S (32 kDa) were identified in mouse cells and BAG-1 expression was reported in murine growth plate and articular chondrocytes. The present study aimed to elucidate the role of BAG-1 in the regulation of molecular mechanisms governing chondrocyte differentiation and turnover during endochondral ossification. In long bones of skeletally immature mice, we observed expression of BAG-1 in the perichondrium, osteoblasts, osteocytes in the bone shaft, bone marrow, growth plate and articular chondrocytes. Monolayer cultures of murine chondrocytic ATDC5 cells, which exhibited robust expression of both BAG-1 isoforms and the Bag-1 transcript, were utilized as an in vitro model to delineate the roles of BAG-1. Overexpression of BAG-1L in ATDC5 cells resulted in downregulation of Col2a1 expression, a gene characteristically downregulated at the onset of hypertrophy, and an increase in transcription of Runx-2 and Alkaline phosphatase, genes normally expressed at the onset of chondrocyte hypertrophy and cartilage mineralization in the process of endochondral ossification. We also demonstrated the anti-apoptotic role of BAG-1 in chondrocytes as overexpression of BAG-1 protected ATDC5 cells, which were subjected to heat-shock at 48 degrees C for 30 min, against heat-shock-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of the SOX-9 protein in ATDC5 cells resulted in increased Bag-1 gene expression. To further investigate the regulation of Bag-1 gene expression by SOX-9, CHO cells were co-transfected with the human Bag-1 gene promoter-Luciferase reporter construct and the human pSox-9 expression vector. Activity of the Bag-1 promoter was significantly enhanced by the SOX-9 protein. In conclusion, a novel finding of this study is the role of BAG-1 as a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in chondrocyte hypertrophy and cartilage mineralization during the process of endochondral ossification. Additionally, we have demonstrated for the first time the regulation of Bag-1 gene expression by SOX-9 and the anti-apoptotic role of BAG-1 in chondrocytic cells. Modulation of Bag-1 expression can therefore mediate chondrocyte differentiation and turnover, and offer further insight into the molecular regulation of endochondral ossification.

Ex vivo modeling of chemical synergy in prenatal kidney cystogenesis.
Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) drives genetic polycystic kidney disease (PKD) cystogenesis. Yet within certain PKD families, striking differences in disease severity exist between affected individuals, and genomic and/or environmental modifying factors have been evoked to explain these observations. We hypothesized that PKD cystogenesis is accentuated by an aberrant fetal milieu, specifically by glucocorticoids. The extent and nature of cystogenesis was assessed in explanted wild-type mouse embryonic metanephroi, using 8-Br-cAMP as a chemical to mimic genetic PKD and the glucocorticoid dexamethasone as the environmental modulator. Cysts and glomeruli were quantified by an observer blinded to culture conditions, and tubules were phenotyped using specific markers. Dexamethasone or 8-Br-cAMP applied on their own produced cysts predominantly arising in proximal tubules and descending limbs of loops of Henle. When applied together, however, dexamethasone over a wide concentration range synergized with 8-Br-cAMP to generate a more severe, glomerulocystic, phenotype; we note that prominent glomerular cysts have been reported in autosomal dominant PKD fetal kidneys. Our data support the idea that an adverse antenatal environment exacerbates renal cystogenesis.

Sexual function of patients with schizophrenia receiving first-generation (FGA) or second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) treatment.
Objectives. The aim of the study was to investigate sexual function in patients with schizophrenia receiving treatment with a first-generation antipsychotic (FGA) or a second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) drug. Sexual function is an important
aspect of human experience, which can be affected by antipsychotic drug treatment. Sexual dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia may be less prevalent with SGA than with FGA drug treatment. 
Methods. A cross-sectional prevalence study assessed sexual function in a sample of 144 patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia aged between 18 and 65, using the Derogatis Interview for Sexual Functioning (self-report version: DISF-SR). Two equal-sized groups (N=72) received treatment with an FGA or an SGA drug for at least 12 weeks. 
Results. No significant differences were seen on DISF-SR total score or subscale score between the two treatment groups. 
Conclusions. There are no differences in measured sexual function of non-randomised patients with schizophrenia treated with an FGA compared with SGA-treated patients.

Targeted therapies in small cell lung cancer: a review.
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive form of lung cancer that is characterized by a rapid doubling time, early onset of dissemination and high sensitivity to chemotherapy. Despite the potential for cure in patients with limited disease with concurrent chemoradiation and an initial good response to chemotherapy in extensive disease, there is a high chance of disease relapse with an overall poor median survival for both stages. With increasing translational research and a better understanding of the molecular basis of cancer, a number of molecular targets have been identified in various preclinical studies. This review summarizes potentially viable targets and new agents that have been developed and employed in recent, ongoing and future clinical trials to attempt to improve clinical outcomes in this disease.

Large Positive Magnetoresistance in Nonstoichiometric NiMnSb Thin Films on Silicon
<p>We report a systematic study of the transport properties of pulsed-laser-deposited NiMnSb films on silicon as a function of film thickness. A low-temperature upturn is observed in the resistivity for film thicknesses of 130 nm and below. The resistivity minimum corresponds to the maximum in the positive magnetoresistance for all samples. As the film thickness decreases, the magnitude of both the resistivity upturn and the. magnetoresistance increase. There is no feature associated with the upturn in the low-field Hall resistivity, which becomes systematically more electron dominated as the film thickness decreases and the temperature increases. This has implications for the use of NiMnSb as a spin injector for spintronic applications. The positive magnetoresistance of the 5 nm sample is greater than 100% at 200 K in 8 T. Further enhancement of the magnetoresistance occurs for field parallel, rather than perpendicular, to the film surface. The magnetoresistance behavior is compared to various model systems, including the band-gap tuning found in the silver chalcogenides, disorder-induced weak localization, and the, emerging class of "bad metal" ferromagnets.</p>

Retroaortic left renal vein and its implications in abdominal aortic surgery.
The embryological development of the retroperitoneal venous system is a complex process. As a result, the anatomy of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and renal veins shows extensive variability. Improper completion of this process may lead to six anatomical variants: retroaortic left renal vein (LRV) types I and II, circumaortic venous collar, duplication of the IVC, transposition or left-sided IVC, and preaortic iliac confluence. All six are infrequent, but may be encountered during abdominal aortic reconstruction and pose challenging problems to the operating surgeon. Failure to appreciate these anomalies can lead to inadvertent injury and major venous bleeding. Preoperative diagnosis can be made on a CT scan, but this is not always performed prior to aortic surgery. In this report, we analyze two cases of retroaortic LRV complicating abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy, describe the most common infrarenal venous anomalies encountered during aortic surgery, and briefly review the literature.

Accepting low back pain: is it related to a good quality of life?
OBJECTIVES: Whether individuals with chronic low back pain (CLBP) are willing to accept their pain, is of interest to pain management, but how far is the acceptance of pain related to a good quality of life (QoL)? Recently available measures now enable this question to be investigated; these are (1) the Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ) and a revised version, here described as a short-form (SF-CPAQ), and (2) the World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment (WHOQOL)-Pain, which is composed of the generic WHOQOL-100 profile (25 facets in 6 domains), and 4 additional facets within a specific pain and discomfort module (PDM). METHOD: Eighty-six CLBP outpatients (62.8% female, mean age 54.3 y, mean pain duration 69.4 mo) completed the CPAQ and WHOQOL-Pain, mailed 2 weeks before a pain clinic appointment. RESULTS: General QoL was positively associated with overall acceptance of pain (CPAQ: r=0.376, P=0.003; SF-CPAQ: r=0.582, P<0.001), and with activity engagement (r=0.455, P<0.001) and pain willingness (r=0.493, P<0.001) specifically. Lower reports of pain were also associated with a better QoL (r=-0.349, P=0.002). Pain level was important in explaining QoL relating to the physical and social domains and pain-related facets assessed by the PDM. Overall, acceptance contributed to explain QoL in the level of independence and environment domains and for pain-related QoL assessed by the PDM. However, pain and acceptance only made a modest contribution to explaining psychologic and social dimensions of QoL. DISCUSSION: The results indicate that present pain level and whether or not pain is accepted play an important role in the QoL of patients with chronic pain. Additionally, the results provide construct validity for the WHOQOL-Pain and SF-CPAQ measures, especially dimensions of pain willingness and activities engagement. The findings have implications for the way health care is delivered, particularly for the role of acceptance-based treatments for individuals with CLBP.

Improved Measurement of the Rossiter-McLaughlin Effect in the Exoplanetary System HD 17156
We present an improved measurement of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for the exoplanetary system HD 17156, based on radial-velocity data gathered with the Subaru 8.2m telescope throughout the planetary transit of UT 2008 November 7. The data allow for a precise and independent determination of the projected spin-orbit angle of this system: λ = 10° over .0 ± 5° over .1. This result supersedes the previous claim of λ = 62° ± 25° by Narita et al., which was based on lower-precision data with poor statistics. Thus the stellar spin and planetary orbital axes of the HD 17156 system are likely to be well-aligned, despite the planet's large orbital eccentricity suggesting a history of strong dynamical interactions.

Enhanced recovery in colorectal resections: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to produce a comprehensive up-to-date meta-analysis exploring the safety and efficacy of enhanced recovery (ER) programmes after colorectal resection. METHOD: Key-word and MESH-heading searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Databases from 1966 to February 2007 were used to identify all available randomized and clinical controlled studies. Two independent reviewers assessed studies for inclusion and exclusion based on methodological quality criteria prior to undertaking data extraction. Summary estimates of treatment effects using a fixed effect model were produced with RevMan 1.0.2, using weighted means for length-of-stay data and relative risks of morbidity, mortality and readmission rates. RESULTS: Analysis of four papers including 376 patients demonstrated primary and total length-of-stays (primary + readmission length-of-stay) to be significantly reduced (P < 0.001) with ER programmes weighted mean differences of -3.64 days (95% confidence interval, 95% CI -4.98 to -2.29) and -3.75 days (95% CI-5.11 to -2.40). Analysis of controlled clinical trial data showed morbidity rates to be reduced and readmission rates increased. These trends were not seen amongst the randomized controlled trial data. There were no differences in mortality rates. CONCLUSION: Enhanced recovery programmes after colorectal resections reduce length-of-stay and may reduce 30 days morbidity and increase 30 days readmission without increasing mortality.

Age-related impairment of endothelial progenitor cell migration correlates with structural alterations of heparan sulfate proteoglycans.
Aging poses one of the largest risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease. The increased propensity toward vascular pathology with advancing age maybe explained, in part, by a reduction in the ability of circulating endothelial progenitor cells to contribute to vascular repair and regeneration. Although there is evidence to suggest that colony forming unit-Hill cells and circulating angiogenic cells are subject to age-associated changes that impair their function, the impact of aging on human outgrowth endothelial cell (OEC) function has been less studied. We demonstrate that OECs isolated from cord blood or peripheral blood samples from young and old individuals exhibit different characteristics in terms of their migratory capacity. In addition, age-related structural changes were discovered in OEC heparan sulfate (HS), a glycocalyx component that is essential in many signalling pathways. An age-associated decline in the migratory response of OECs toward a gradient of VEGF significantly correlated with a reduction in the relative percentage of the trisulfated disaccharide, 2-O-sulfated-uronic acid, N, 6-O-sulfated-glucosamine (UA2S-GlcNS6S), within OEC cell surface HS polysaccharide chains. Furthermore, disruption of cell surface HS reduced the migratory response of peripheral blood-derived OECs isolated from young subjects to levels similar to that observed for OECs from older individuals. Together these findings suggest that aging is associated with alterations in the fine structure of HS on the cell surface of OECs. Such changes may modulate the migration, homing, and engraftment capacity of these repair cells, thereby contributing to the progression of endothelial dysfunction and age-related vascular pathologies.

Processing with a million cores
Traditionally, the performance-limiting attributes of a multi-processor machine are memory bandwidth, the need to maintain state coherence, and simple synchronisation issues, or some combination of these. As the system size increases, so too does the relative cost overhead of solving these problems. The SpiNNaker engine is a million core system with over eight terabytes of distributed memory whose fundamental design axioms neatly sidestep these problems: the processors are not synchronised, the memory is not coherent, and the inter-processor communication is non-deterministic. How, then, can we perform meaningful computations with this architecture?

Generalizing genetical genomics: getting added value from environmental perturbation
Genetical genomics is a useful approach for studying the effect of genetic perturbations on biological systems at the molecular level. However, molecular networks depend on the environmental conditions and, thus, a comprehensive understanding of biological systems requires studying them across multiple environments. We propose a generalization of genetical genomics, which combines genetic and sensibly chosen environmental perturbations, to study the plasticity of molecular networks. This strategy forms a crucial step toward understanding why individuals respond differently to drugs, toxins, pathogens, nutrients and other environmental influences. Here we outline a strategy for selecting and allocating individuals to particular treatments, and we discuss the promises and pitfalls of the generalized genetical genomics approach. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Patients’ subjective rating of mental health improvement on clozapine Abstract. 12th Biennial Winter Workshop on Schizophrenia, Davos, Switzerland.
Background: The subjective experience of patients with schizophrenia, receiving antipsychotic medication has been a neglected research area.Methods: In a randomised controlled trial comparing the impact of new atypical antipsychotic drugs versus clozapine, 67 out of 136 patients with schizophrenia were randomised to receive clozapine. Baseline and 12 week assessments included the PANSS, DAI, and the Kemp Compliance scale.Results: The greater percentage improvement in total PANSS scores in patients randomised to clozapine was statistically significant when compared to the atypical group at 12 weeks (p < 0.05). Patients’ subjective rating of their mental health improvement since commencing clozapine treatment correlated significantly with actual percentage improvement in PANSS scores from baseline to week 12 (p < 0.01). Significant correlations were also observed between the patients’ subjective rating of their mental health improvement and both DAI score and theg12 PANSS insight item (p < 0.05). In a regression analysis, DAI score at week 12 explained 26% of the variance in patients’ subjective rating of mental health improvement with clozapine. Percentage PANSS improvement explained a further 8% of the variance.Conclusion: Patients in an RCT of clozapine versus atypicals were able to subjectively rate their own improved mental health status, validated by objective improvement on the PANSS. This was predicted by drug attitude as measured by the DAI. Subjective reports are a useful and valid outcome measure in drug treatment trials.

Investigating different mechanisms for biogenic selenite transformations: Geobacter sulfurreducens, Shewanella oneidensis and Veillonella atypica
The metal-reducing bacteria Geobacter sulfurreducens, Shewanella oneidensis and Veillonella atypica, use different mechanisms to transform toxic, bioavailable sodium selenite to less toxic, non-mobile elemental selenium and then to selenide in anaerobic environments, offering the potential for in situ and ex situ bioremediation of contaminated soils, sediments, industrial effluents, and agricultural drainage waters. The products of these reductive transformations depend on both the organism involved and the reduction conditions employed, in terms of electron donor and exogenous extracellular redox mediator. The intermediary phase involves the precipitation of elemental selenium nanospheres and the potential role of proteins in the formation of these structures is discussed. The bionanomineral phases produced during these transformations, including both elemental selenium nanospheres and metal selenide nanoparticles, have catalytic, semiconducting and light-emitting properties, which may have unique applications in the realm of nanophotonics. This research offers the potential to combine remediation of contaminants with the development of environmentally friendly manufacturing pathways for novel bionanominerals.

EFFECT OF CORD BLOOD CADMIUM LEVEL ON PLACENTAL ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE ACTIVITY AND BIRTH WEIGHT IN AN OIL PRODUCING AREA.
The effect of cord blood cadmium level on placental alkaline phosphatase activity and birth weight in an oil producing area was studied in this research. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of cord blood cadmium level on alkaline phosphatase activity and if cadmium concentration had effect on birth weight. The results obtained shows no significant difference (P&gt;0.05) in the concentration of cadmium and the activity of placental alkaline phosphatase respectively in the various groups. The results from this study also revealed that increased exposure to cadmium would lead to increase alkaline phosphatase activity (P&gt;0.05). The results from the investigation on the effect of cadmium on birth weight showed that there was a negative significant correlation detected between cord blood cadmium level and birth weight (BW) at P&gt;0.05. The results showed that increased cadmium level in cord blood reduces BW for each group that was studied. &nbsp; KEYWORDS:&nbsp; Cadmium, oil producing area, alkaline phosphatase, cord blood &amp; birth weight.

The wavenumber–frequency content of resonantly excited equatorial waves
The theoretical resonant excitation of equatorial inertia–gravity waves and mixed Rossby–gravity waves is examined. Contrary to occasionally published expectations, solutions show that winds that are broadband in both zonal wavenumber and frequency do not in general produce peaks in the wavenumber–frequency spectrum of sea surface height (SSH) at wavenumbers associated with vanishing zonal group velocity.

Excitation of total wave energy in inertia–gravity modes by broadband zonal winds is virtually wavenumber independent when the meridional structure of the winds does not impose a bias toward negative or positive zonal wavenumbers. With increasing wavenumber magnitude |k|, inertia–gravity waves asymptote toward zonally propagating pure gravity waves, in which the magnitude of meridional velocity υ becomes progressively smaller relative to the magnitude of zonal velocity u and pressure p. When the total wave energy is independent of wavenumber, this effect produces a peak in |υ|2 near the wavenumber where group velocity vanishes, but a trough in |p|2 (or SSH variance). Another consequence of the shift toward pure gravity wave structure is that broadband meridional winds excite inertia–gravity modes progressively less efficiently as |k| increases and υ becomes less important to the wave structure. Broadband meridional winds produce a low-wavenumber peak in total wave energy leading to a subtle elevation of |p|2 at low wavenumbers, but this is due entirely to the decrease in the forcing efficiency of meridional winds with increasing |k|, rather than to the vanishing of the group velocity. Physical conditions that might alter the above conclusions are discussed.Author Posting. © American Meteorological Society, 2012.

Predicting the strongest domain-domain contact in interacting protein pairs.
Experiments to determine the complete 3-dimensional structures ofprotein complexes are difficult to perform and only a limited range of suchstructures are available.In contrast, large-scale screening experiments haveidentified thousands of pairwise interactions between proteins, but suchexperiments do not produce explicit structural information. In addition, thedata produced by these high through-put experiments contain large numbers offalse positive results, and can be biased against detection of certain typesof interaction.Several methods exist that analyse such pairwise interactiondata in terms of the constituent domains within proteins, scoring pairs ofdomain superfamilies according to their propensity to interact. These scorescan be used to predict the strongest domain-domain contact (the contact withthe largest surface area) between interacting proteins for which the domain-levelstructures of the individual proteins are known.We test this predictive approachon a set of pairwise protein interactions taken from the Protein QuaternaryStructure (PQS) database for which the true domain-domain contacts are known.While the overall prediction success rate across the whole test data set ispoor, we shown how interactions in the test data set for which the trainingdata are not informative can be automatically excluded from the predictionprocess, giving improved prediction success rates at the expense ofrestricted coverage of the test data.

Studies of the plume emission during the femtosecond and nanosecond ablation of graphite in nitrogen
<p>Comparative studies of the pulsed laser ablation of graphite in 20 mTorr of N-2 using both 15 ns and 450 fs pulses at a wavelength of 248 nm are reported. Emissions from the resulting ablation plumes, and from collisions with ablated material and the background N-2 gas molecules, have been investigated by wavelength-, space-, and time-resolved optical emission spectroscopy (OES), and the observations correlated with the results of the analyses of films formed when such material is incident on a silicon substrate. Wavelength-dispersed spectra of the plume arising in nanosecond ablation reveal C I, C II, and C-2 emissions-concentrated close to the target-and, at greater distances, strong CN and weak N-2(+) emissions. N-2(+)(B-X) emission dominates in the case of femtosecond ablation. Time-gated imaging studies have allowed estimation of propagation velocities for these various emissions. Possible production routes for secondary emitters such as CN and N-2(+) are discussed, and arguments presented to show that measurements of the apparent propagation "velocities" of such emissions are unlikely to provide meaningful measures of the velocities (or energies) with which these carriers impact on a substrate surface. Laser Raman spectroscopy confirms nitrogen incorporation within the films grown by both nanosecond and femtosecond ablations; the former films are deduced to be both thicker and to have higher N content-findings that accord with the OES analyses.</p>

Stromal-epithelial metabolic coupling in cancer: integrating autophagy and metabolism in the tumor microenvironment.
Cancer cells do not exist as pure homogeneous populations in vivo. Instead they are embedded in "cancer cell nests" that are surrounded by stromal cells, especially cancer associated fibroblasts. Thus, it is not unreasonable to suspect that stromal fibroblasts could influence the metabolism of adjacent cancer cells, and visa versa. In accordance with this idea, we have recently proposed that the Warburg effect in cancer cells may be due to culturing cancer cells by themselves, out of their normal stromal context or tumor microenvironment. In fact, when cancer cells are co-cultured with fibroblasts, then cancer cells increase their mitochondrial mass, while fibroblasts lose their mitochondria. An in depth analysis of this phenomenon reveals that aggressive cancer cells are "parasites" that use oxidative stress as a "weapon" to extract nutrients from surrounding stromal cells. Oxidative stress in fibroblasts induces the autophagic destruction of mitochondria, by mitophagy. Then, stromal cells are forced to undergo aerobic glycolysis, and produce energy-rich nutrients (such as lactate and ketones) to "feed" cancer cells. This mechanism would allow cancer cells to seed anywhere, without blood vessels as a food source, as they could simply induce oxidative stress wherever they go, explaining how cancer cells survive during metastasis. We suggest that stromal catabolism, via autophagy and mitophagy, fuels the anabolic growth of tumor cells, promoting tumor progression and metastasis. We have previously termed this new paradigm "The Autophagic Tumor Stroma Model of Cancer Metabolism", or the "Reverse Warburg Effect". We also discuss how glutamine addiction (glutaminolysis) in cancer cells fits well with this new model, by promoting oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in aggressive cancer cells.

Neurotransmitters and Integration in Neuronal-Astroglial Networks.
Two major neural cell types, glia, astrocytes in particular, and neurones can release chemical transmitters that act as soluble signalling compounds for intercellular communication. Exocytosis, a process which depends on an increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) levels, represents a common denominator for release of neurotransmitters, stored in secretory vesicles, from these neural cells. While neurones rely predominately on the immediate entry of Ca(2+) from the extracellular space to the cytosol in this process, astrocytes support their cytosolic Ca(2+) increases by appropriating this ion from the intracellular endoplasmic reticulum store and extracellular space. Additionally, astrocytes can release neurotransmitters using a variety of non-vesicular pathways which are mediated by an assortment of plasmalemmal channels and transporters. Once a neuronal and/or astrocytic neurotransmitter is released into the extracellular space, it can activate plasma membrane neurotransmitter receptors on neural cells, causing autocrine and/or paracrine signalling. Moreover, chemical transmission is essential not only for homocellular, but also for heterocellular bi-directional communication in the brain. Further detailed understanding of chemical transmission will aid our comprehension of the brain (dys)function in heath and disease.

Case Study: “Hair meets Design”: The Application of Storytelling in the Context of Long-Distance Collaboration and Virtual Teamwork
<p>Virtual teamwork and long distance collaboration is an increasingly attractive option in design education especially when students and other participants, (for example, industry guests or sponsors) cannot meet in the same physical place or classroom.</p>
<p>
The constant improvement in technology allows this type of electronic communication to be increasingly accepted as an appropriate format for collaboration and evaluation of student projects. </p>
<p>
This paper discusses the collaboration between members of a company in Germany and a group of industrial design students in California. It will present the work flow, the evaluation tools and the formats introduced during the process.</p>
<p>
Since the participants of this project could not meet physically to discuss and evaluate ideas, it was imperative for the teams to develop standard visual formats that were easy to understand and re-utilize. These formats had to be flexible enough for the purpose of adding comments from the evaluators. </p>
<p>
Because the physical presence of the presenter is missing, it is necessary to adjust the content and layout of the messages in order to make them more relevant and self-explanatory. The message has to be easy to understand without the help of a presenter or lecturer. </p>
<p>
One of the most significant questions in this project was how to present multiple “layers of information” in one single image at the same time (for example, how to depict work flow, time sequence and object hierarchy in one single frame). </p>
<p>
In a normal situation (where the presenter is physically present in front of an audience) he/she can verbally add secondary information that would not be visually included but it is necessary in order to understand the relevance of the image being presented. This additional verbal information could be related to time, hierarchy, etc.</p>
<p>
This paper will discuss the development and evaluation of visual formats that present multiple layers of information in one single image. It describes the methods used and reports the solutions. Ultimately, this paper explains the relevance of using storytelling in the context of long-distance design collaboration.

Tumor cells induce the cancer associated fibroblast phenotype via caveolin-1 degradation: implications for breast cancer and DCIS therapy with autophagy inhibitors.
Loss of stromal caveolin 1 (Cav-1) is a novel biomarker for cancer-associated fibroblasts that predicts poor clinical outcome in breast cancer and DCIS patients. We hypothesized that epithelial cancer cells may have the ability to drive Cav-1 downregulation in adjacent normal fibroblasts, thereby promoting the cancer associated fibroblast phenotype. To test this hypothesis directly, here we developed a novel co-culture model employing (i) human breast cancer cells (MCF7), and (ii) immortalized fibroblasts (hTERT-BJ1), which are grown under defined experimental conditions. Importantly, we show that co-culture of immortalized human fibroblasts with MCF7 breast cancer cells leads to Cav-1 downregulation in fibroblasts. These results were also validated using primary cultures of normal human mammary fibroblasts co-cultured with MCF7 cells. In this system, we show that Cav-1 downregulation is mediated by autophagic/lysosomal degradation, as pre-treatment with lysosome-specific inhibitors rescues Cav-1 expression. Functionally, we demonstrate that fibroblasts co-cultured with MCF7 breast cancer cells acquire a cancer associated fibroblast phenotype, characterized by Cav-1 downregulation, increased expression of myofibroblast markers and extracellular matrix proteins, and constitutive activation of TGFβ/Smad2 signaling. siRNA-mediated Cav-1 downregulation mimics several key changes that occur in co-cultured fibroblasts, clearly indicating that a loss of Cav-1 is a critical initiating factor, driving stromal fibroblast activation during tumorigenesis. As such, this co-culture system can now be used as an experimental model for generating "synthetic" cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs). More specifically, these "synthetic" CAFs could be used for drug screening to identify novel therapeutics that selectively target the Cav-1-negative tumor micro-environment. Our findings also suggest that chloroquine, or other autophagy/lysosome inhibitors, may be useful as anti-cancer agents, to therapeutically restore the expression of stromal Cav-1 in cancer associated fibroblasts. We discuss this possibility, in light of the launch of a new clinical trial that uses chloroquine to treat DCIS patients: PINC (Preventing Invasive Breast Neoplasia with Cholorquine) See http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01023477.

Comparison of three screening tools to detect psoriatic arthritis in patients with psoriasis (CONTEST study).
BACKGROUND: Multiple questionnaires to screen for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) have been developed but the optimal screening questionnaire is unknown. AIMS: To compare three PsA screening questionnaires in a head-to-head study using CASPAR criteria as the gold standard. METHODS: This study recruited from 10 UK secondary care dermatology clinics. Patients with a diagnosis of psoriasis, not previously diagnosed as PsA, were given all 3 questionnaires. All patients who were positive on any questionnaire were invited for a rheumatological assessment. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare the sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC) of the 3 questionnaires according to CASPAR criteria. RESULTS: In total, 938 patients with psoriasis were invited to participate and 657 (70%) patients returned the questionnaires. One or more questionnaires were positive in 314 patients (48%) and195 (63%) patients attended for assessment. Of these, 47 patients (24%) were diagnosed with PsA according to the CASPAR Criteria. The proportion of patients with PsA increased with the number of positive questionnaires (1 questionnaire =19.1%, 2 =34.0%, 3 =46.8%). Sensitivities and specificities for the three questionnaires, with areas under the ROC curve: PASE, 74.5%, 38.5%, 0.594; PEST, 76.6%, 37.2%, 0.610; ToPAS, 76.6%, 29.7%, 0.554. The majority of patients with a false positive response had degenerative or osteoarthritis. CONCLUSION: Although the PEST and ToPAS questionnaires performed slightly better than the PASE questionnaire at identifying PsA, there is little difference between these instruments.

The quality of trials in operative surgery.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the reported quality of trials in operative surgery. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in operative surgery have previously been criticized for using weak methodology despite no evidence to suggest their quality is any different from nonsurgical trials. STUDY DESIGN: All surgical RCTs published in the British Medical Journal, the Journal of the American Medical Association, The Lancet, and the New England Journal of Medicine between 1998 and 2004 were identified. The adequacy of the reported methodology used to perform the randomization, power calculation, and recruitment was assessed for each trial using predefined criteria. The results from the surgical trials were compared with a randomly selected control group of nonsurgical RCTs, which were matched for journal and year of publication. RESULTS: Sixty-six surgical RCTs were identified. Adequate reporting of randomization sequence generation was seen in 42% (n = 28) of surgical trials and 30% (n = 20) of nonsurgical trials, and adequate allocation concealment was recorded in 46% (n = 30) and 47% (n = 31), respectively. When combining these 2 interrelated steps of randomization, only 26% (n = 17) of surgical trials and 23% (n = 15) of nonsurgical trials reported both adequately. Adequate recruitment was recorded in 52% (n = 33 of 63) surgical and 55% (n = 33 of 60) nonsurgical trials, with approximately a quarter (n = 17 and n = 16, respectively) of the trials in both the surgical and nonsurgical categories reporting an adequate power calculation. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence that the reported quality of surgical trials was different to nonsurgical trials. However, approximately half or less of all the trials reviewed reported adequate methodology.

Making new out of old: recycling and modification of an ancient protein translocation system during eukaryotic evolution. Mechanistic comparison and phylogenetic analysis of ERAD, SELMA and the peroxisomal importomer.
At first glance the three eukaryotic protein translocation machineries-the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) transport apparatus of the endoplasmic reticulum, the peroxisomal importomer and SELMA, the pre-protein translocator of complex plastids-appear quite different. However, mechanistic comparisons and phylogenetic analyses presented here suggest that all three translocation machineries share a common ancestral origin, which highlights the recycling of pre-existing components as an effective evolutionary driving force.

An X-ray absorption study of the fate of technetium in reduced and reoxidised sediments and mineral phases
Technetium is a long lived (2.13 x 10(5) a), beta emitting radionuclide which is a groundwater contaminant at a number of nuclear facilities throughout the world. Its environmental behaviour is primarily governed by its redox state. Under oxic conditions it forms the highly soluble pertechnetate (TcO4-) ion; under reducing conditions it forms the poorly soluble, reduced forms of Tc, particularly the Tc(IV) ion which is expected to precipitate as hydrous TcO2 above its solubility limit (10(-9) mol l(-1) at similar to pH 7) or to be strongly sorbed to mineral surfaces at lower concentrations. Thus the redox cycling behaviour of Tc is predicted to be key to its environmental behaviour in the natural and engineered environment. Here the results of a series of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments which examine the oxidation state and coordination environment of Tc in a range of estuarine, aquifer and freshwater sediment suspensions, and in an environmentally relevant amorphous Fe(II) phase under both reduced and reoxidised biogeochemical conditions are presented. In reduced sediments and the amorphous Fe(II) phase prior to reoxidation, XAS results show that Tc was retained as hydrous TcO2-like phases across all samples. Under air reoxidation, experiments showed significant (up to 80\%) remobilisation of Tc to solution as TcO4-. In pre-reduced freshwater sediments, aquifer sediments and the amorphous Fe(II) phase oxidised with air, XAS indicated that Tc remained associated with the solids as hydrous TcO2-like phases. By contrast, in air reoxidised estuarine sediment XAS analysis suggested that both hydrous TcO2-like phases and TcO4 were retained within the sediment. Finally, when microbial ly-mediated NO3 reoxidation occurred in estuarine and aquifer sediment slurries, experiments showed comparatively low (<8\%) remobilisation of Tc from solids over similar timescales to air reoxidation experiments, whilst XAS again showed that both hydrous TcO2-like phases and TcO4 were retained within the sediment. By contrast, in the amorphous Fe(II) phase, although NO3 reoxidation again led to low (<4\%) remobilisation of Tc from solids, XAS analysis showed that Tc was retained as hydrous TcO2-like phases alone. These results are discussed in the context of the redox cycling behaviour of Tc in the natural and engineered environment. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

[product, firm, demand, success, manager]

Why Are Bad Products So Hard to Kill?
It is puzzling that firms often continue to invest in product development projects when they should know that demand will be low. We argue that bad products are hard to kill because firms face an inherent conflict when designing managers' incentives. Rewarding success encourages managers to forge ahead even when demand is low. To avoid investing in low-demand products, the firm must also reward decisions to kill products. However, rewarding managers for killing products effectively undermines the rewards for success. The inability to resolve this tension forces the firm to choose between paying an even larger bonus for success and accepting continued investment in low-demand products. We explore the boundaries of this argument by analyzing how the timing of demand information affects product investment decisions.

[pathway, innate, classical, bacterial, immunity, complement, response, component, pathogen, igm]

The classical pathway is the dominant complement pathway required for innate immunity to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection in mice.
The complement system is an important component of the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae. The classical complement pathway is activated by antibody-antigen complexes on the bacterial surface and has been considered predominately to be an effector of the adaptive immune response, whereas the alternative and mannose-binding lectin pathways are activated directly by bacterial cell surface components and are considered effectors of the innate immune response. Recently, a role has been suggested for the classical pathway during innate immunity that is activated by natural IgM or components of the acute-phase response bound to bacterial pathogens. However, the functional importance of the classical pathway for innate immunity to S. pneumoniae and other bacterial pathogens, and its relative contribution compared with the alternative and mannose-binding lectin pathways has not been defined. By using strains of mice with genetic deficiencies of complement components and secretory IgM we have investigated the role of each complement pathway and natural IgM for innate immunity to S. pneumoniae. Our results show that the proportion of a population of S. pneumoniae bound by C3 depends mainly on the classical pathway, whereas the intensity of C3 binding depends on the alternative pathway. Furthermore, the classical pathway, partially targeted by the binding of natural IgM to bacteria, is the dominant pathway for activation of the complement system during innate immunity to S. pneumoniae, loss of which results in rapidly progressing septicemia and impaired macrophage activation. These data demonstrate the vital role of the classical pathway for innate immunity to a bacterial pathogen.

[suicide, ect, patient, case, rate]

Electroconvulsive therapy and suicide among the mentally ill in England: a national clinical survey.
We aimed to determine the number and characteristics of psychiatric patients receiving electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) who had subsequently died by suicide. Data were collected on an 8-year (1999-2006) sample of suicide cases in England who had been in recent contact with mental health services. Of 9752 suicides, 71 (1%) were being treated with ECT at the time of death. Although the number of patients who received ECT had fallen substantially over time, the rate of suicide in these individuals showed no clear decrease and averaged 9 deaths per year, or a rate of 10.8 per 10,000 patients treated. These suicide cases were typically older, with high rates of affective disorder and previous self-harm. They were more likely to be an in-patient at the time of death than other suicide cases. Nearly half of the community cases who had received ECT had died within 3 months of discharge. Our results demonstrated that the fall in the use of ECT has not affected suicide rates in patients receiving this treatment. Services appear to acknowledge the high risk of suicide in those receiving ECT. Improvements in care of these severely ill patients may include careful discharge planning and improved observation of in-patients in receipt of ECT.

Childhood cancer mortality in Australia.
Aim: To determine current rates of childhood cancer mortality at a national level for Australia and to evaluate recent trends. Methods: Using population-based data from the Australian Paediatric Cancer Registry, we calculated cancer-related mortality counts and rates for the 3-year period 2006-2008 and trends between 1998 and 2008 by sex, age group, and cause of death (defined according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancers, third edition). Rates were directly age-standardised to the 2000 World Standard Population, and linear regression was used to determine the magnitude and significance of trends. The standardised mortality ratio for non-cancer deaths among children with cancer was also estimated. Results: A total of 282 children (23 per million per year) died from cancer in Australia between 2006 and 2008. Large decreases were observed in cancer mortality rates over the study period, particularly for boys (-5.5% per year; p<0.001), children aged 10-14 years old (-5.5% per year; p=0.001), and leukaemia patients (-9.4% per year; p<0.001). However, there was no significant change in mortality due to tumours of the central nervous system. Children with cancer were twice as likely to die from non-cancer causes compared to other children (SMR=2.06; p=0.001). Conclusions: While ongoing improvements in childhood cancer mortality in Australia are generally encouraging, of concern is the lack of a corresponding decrease in mortality among children with certain types of tumours of the central nervous system during the past decade. The results also highlight the need for intensive monitoring of childhood cancer patients for other serious diseases that may subsequently arise.

[dd, xiaflex, fibroblast, collagenase, disease]

In vitro study of novel collagenase (XIAFLEX®) on Dupuytren's disease fibroblasts displays unique drug related properties.
Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a benign, fibroproliferative disease of the palmar fascia, with excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and over-production of cytokines and growth factors, resulting in digital fixed flexion contractures limiting hand function and patient quality of life. Surgical fasciectomy is the gold standard treatment but is invasive and has associated morbidity without limiting disease recurrence. Injectable Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH)--Xiaflex®--is a novel, nonsurgical option with clinically proven in vivo reduction of DD contractures but with limited in vitro data demonstrating its cellular and molecular effects. The aim of this study was to delineate the effects of CCH on primary fibroblasts isolated from DD and non-DD anatomical sites (using RTCA, LDH, WST-1, FACS, qRT-PCR, ELISA and In-Cell Quantitative Western Blotting) to compare the efficacy of varying concentrations of Xiaflex® against a reagent grade Collagenase, Collagenase A. Results demonstrated that DD nodule and cord fibroblasts had greater proliferation than those from fat and skin. Xiaflex® exposure resulted in dose- and time-dependent inhibition of cellular spreading, attachment and proliferation, with cellular recovery after enzyme removal. Unlike Collagenase A, Xiaflex® did not cause apoptosis. Collagen expression patterns were significantly (p<0.05) different in DD fibroblasts across anatomical sites - the highest levels of collagen I and III were detected in DD nodule, with DD cord and fat fibroblasts demonstrating a smaller increase in both collagen expression relative to DD skin. Xiaflex® significantly (p<0.05) down-regulated ECM components, cytokines and growth factors in a dose-dependent manner. An in vitro scratch wound assay model demonstrated that, at low concentrations, Xiaflex® enabled a faster fibroblast reparatory migration into the wound, whereas, at high concentrations, this process was significantly (p<0.05) inhibited. This is the first report elucidating potential mechanisms of action of Xiaflex® on Dupuytren fibroblasts, offering a greater insight and a better understanding of its effect in DD.

Site-specific immunophenotyping of keloid disease demonstrates immune upregulation and the presence of lymphoid aggregates.
BACKGROUND: Keloid disease (KD) is a common fibroproliferative disorder of unknown aetiology. T cells and macrophages are increased in KD and are thought to contribute to its pathogenesis. However, while a link between inflammation and fibrotic disorders is well known for other disorders, it remains undetermined in KD. OBJECTIVES: Systematically to immunophenotype the inflammatory infiltrate of KD in situ in a site-specific manner, and to compare this with normal skin and scar tissue. METHODS: Sixty-eight keloid cases were screened for the presence of all three (intralesional, perilesional and extralesional) keloid-associated specific tissue sites. Subsequently, a complete set of 25 keloid biopsies (from different patients) was compared with normal skin (n = 11) and normal scar (n = 11) samples and subjected to systematic, site-specific quantitative immunohistomorphometry and histochemistry, using a range of immunological markers of B cells, T cells, macrophages, mast cells (MCs) and Langerhans cells. RESULTS: T cells, B cells, degranulated and mature MCs (coexpressing OX40 ligand) and alternative macrophages (M2) were all significantly increased in intralesional and perilesional KD sites compared with normal skin and scar tissue (P < 0·05). Additionally, 10 of 68 KD cases (15%) showed the presence of distinctive lymphoid aggregates, which resembled mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). CONCLUSIONS: The increased number and activity of MCs and M2 may implicate inflammation in the fibrotic process in KD. The distinct KD-associated lymphoid aggregate resembles MALT, for which we propose the term 'keloid-associated lymphoid tissue' (KALT). It may perpetuate inflammatory stimuli that promote KD growth. KALT, MCs and M2 are promising novel targets for future KD therapy.

[cell, nanotube]

Cutting edge: Membrane nanotubes connect immune cells.
We present evidence that nanotubular highways, or membrane nanotubes, facilitate a novel mechanism for intercellular communication in the immune system. Nanotubes were seen to connect multiple cells together and were readily formed between a variety of cell types, including human peripheral blood NK cells, macrophages, and EBV-transformed B cells. Nanotubes could be created upon disassembly of the immunological synapse, as cells move apart. Thus, nanotubular networks could be assembled from transient immunological synapses. Nanotubes were seen to contain GFP-tagged cell surface class I MHC protein expressed in one of the connected cells. Moreover, GPI-conjugated to GFP originating from one cell was transferred onto the surface of another at the connection with a nanotube. Thus, nanotubes can traffic cell surface proteins between immune cells over many tens of microns. Determining whether there are physiological functions for nanotubes is an intriguing new goal for cellular immunology.

Community nursing and stroke: a reassessment of the issues.
Recent research has highlighted the difficulties that stroke patients and carers experience in navigating a recovery path through a complex array of service providers. Many of these difficulties relate to continuing recovery from stroke at home, often when professional help is decreasing. A study by Gibbon (1994) demonstrated a potential role for community nurses in helping patients and carers to cope with the aftermath of stroke. This article reassesses the issues that affect the capacity of community nurses to develop this role. A focus group conducted with community nursing students identified a number of barriers to the expansion of service provision for this patient group, including workload pressures, training and management support. Understanding of the problems faced by stroke patients and their carers in the current organization of continuing care and rehabilitation is required to support expansion of nursing practice in this area.

Macroscopic graphene membranes and their extraordinary stiffness
The properties of suspended graphene are currently attracting enormous interest, but the small size of available samples and the difficulties in making them severely restrict the number of experimental techniques that can be used to study the optical, mechanical, electronic, thermal, and other characteristics of this one-atom-thick material. Here, we describe a new and highly reliable approach for making graphene membranes of a macroscopic size (currently up to 100 mu m in diameter) and their characterization by transmission electron microscopy. In particular, we have found that long graphene beams supported by only one side do not scroll or fold, in striking contrast to the current perception of graphene as a supple thin fabric, but demonstrate sufficient stiffness to support extremely large loads, millions of times exceeding their own weight, in agreement with the presented theory. Our work opens many avenues for studying suspended graphene and using it in various micromechanical systems and electron microscopy.

Theoretical and Empirical Analysis of Diversity in Non-Stationary Learning
In non-stationary learning, we require a predictive model to learn over time, adapting to changes in the concept if necessary. A major concern in any algorithm for non-stationary learning is its rate of adaptation to new concepts. When tackling such problems with ensembles, the concept of \emph{diversity} appears to be of significance. In this paper, we discuss how we expect diversity to impact the rate of adaptation in non-stationary ensemble learning. We then analyse the relation between voting margins and a popular measure of diversity, KW variance, and use the similarities between them to draw some useful conclusions regarding ensemble adaptivity.

Map2k4 functions as a tumor suppressor in lung adenocarcinoma and inhibits tumor cell invasion by decreasing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ2 expression.
MAP2K4 encodes a dual-specificity kinase (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4, or MKK4) that is mutated in a variety of human malignancies, but the biochemical properties of the mutant kinases and their roles in tumorigenesis have not been fully elucidated. Here we showed that 8 out of 11 cancer-associated MAP2K4 mutations reduce MKK4 protein stability or impair its kinase activity. On the basis of findings from bioinformatic studies on human cancer cell lines with homozygous MAP2K4 loss, we posited that MKK4 functions as a tumor suppressor in lung adenocarcinomas that develop in mice owing to expression of mutant Kras and Tp53. Conditional Map2k4 inactivation in the bronchial epithelium of mice had no discernible effect alone but increased the multiplicity and accelerated the growth of incipient lung neoplasias induced by oncogenic Kras. MKK4 suppressed the invasion and metastasis of Kras-Tp53-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cells. MKK4 deficiency increased peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor γ2 (PPARγ2) expression through noncanonical MKK4 substrates, and PPARγ2 enhanced tumor cell invasion. We conclude that Map2k4 functions as a tumor suppressor in lung adenocarcinoma and inhibits tumor cell invasion by decreasing PPARγ2 levels.

Large effective-strain piezoelectric actuators using nested cellular architecture with exponential strain amplification mechanisms
Design and analysis of piezoelectric actuators having over 20% effective strain using an exponential strain amplification mechanism are presented in this paper. Piezoelectric ceramic material, such as lead zirconate titanate (PZT), has large stress and bandwidth, but its extremely small strain, i.e., only 0.1%, has been a major bottleneck for broad applications. This paper presents a new strain amplification design, called a “nested rhombus” multilayer mechanism, that increases strain exponentially through its hierarchical cellular structure. This allows for over 20% effective strain. In order to design the whole actuator structure, not only the compliance of piezoelectric material but also the compliance of the amplification structures needs to be taken into account. This paper addresses how the output force and displacement are attenuated by the compliance involved in the strain amplification mechanism through kinematic and static analysis. An insightful lumped parameter model is proposed to quantify the performance degradation and facilitate design tradeoffs. A prototype-nested PZT cellular actuator that weighs only 15 g has produced 21% effective strain (2.5 mm displacement from 12-mm actuator length and 30 mm width) and 1.7 N blocking force.

Microarrays on gold:New applications for biocatalysis and proteomics
Microarrays on gold have been used to develop new methodologies for biocatalysis and proteomic applications. The technology applies the logic of solid phase supported chemistry using self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on a gold chip. The advantages of this technology are: i) an easy to handle platform, ii) parallel screening (64 reactions at once), iii) microliter scale reactions (1µL per sample), iv the use of mild conditions (buffers and t=37 °C), v) the absence of purification steps (only chip washing is required), vi) quick and accurate analysis by MALDI ToF MS.The metallopeptidase thermolysin was studied in peptide-coupling reactions to profile reactivity and specificity (Chapter 2). Reactivity was further investigated in transpeptidation reactions. Comparing the serine peptidase chymotrypsin with the zinc dependent thermolysin, it was found that transpeptidations proceed via N-transacylation reactions independent of a specific enzymatic catalytic mechanism (Chapter 3). These transacylations may be exploited for modifications of biocompatible and selective surfaces in ‘bottom-up’ bionanofabrication technologies. Selected peptidases with different catalytic mechanism were also arrayed to investigate polymerisation ability of dipeptides (Chapter 4). It was shown that oligomerisation can be obtained under mild conditions and a set of peptides was synthesised. Chapter 5 describes a new chemical methodology by which crude tryptic peptide digests can be trapped on chip and analysed by MALDI ToF MS without further purification steps. This dramatically improves time and cost efficiency.Finally, a new stepwise native chemical ligation methodology is proposed for amino acids, and peptides containing N-terminal cysteine residues (Chapter 6).

Deletion of scbA enhances antibiotic production in Streptomyces lividans
Antibiotic production in many streptomycetes is influenced by extracellular ??-butyrolactone signalling molecules. In this study, the gene scbA, which had been shown previously to be involved in the synthesis of the ??-butyrolactone SCB1 in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), was deleted from the chromosome of Streptomyces lividans 66. Deletion of scbA eliminated the production of the antibiotic stimulatory activity previously associated with SCB1 in S. coelicolor. When the S. lividans scbA mutant was transformed with a multi-copy plasmid carrying the gene encoding the pathway-specific activator for either actinorhodin or undecylprodigiosin biosynthesis, production of the corresponding antibiotic was elevated significantly compared to the corresponding scbA + strain carrying the same plasmid. Consequently, deletion of scbA may be useful in combination with other strategies to construct host strains capable of improved bioactive metabolite production.

Vandetanib plus pemetrexed for the second-line treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a randomized, double-blind phase III trial.
PURPOSE: Vandetanib is a once-daily oral inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor signaling. This randomized, placebo-controlled phase III study assessed the efficacy of vandetanib plus pemetrexed as second-line therapy in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (N = 534) were randomly assigned to receive vandetanib 100 mg/d plus pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) every 21 days (n = 256) or placebo plus pemetrexed (n = 278). Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary end point; overall survival, objective response rate, disease control rate, time to deterioration of symptoms, and safety were secondary assessments. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in PFS between treatment arms (hazard ratio HR, 0.86; 97.58% CI, 0.69 to 1.06; P = .108). Overall survival was also not significantly different (HR, 0.86; 97.54% CI, 0.65 to 1.13; P = .219). Statistically significant improvements in objective response rate (19% v 8%; P < .001) and time to deterioration of symptoms (HR, 0.71; P = .0052; median, 18.1 weeks for vandetanib and 12.1 weeks for placebo) were observed in patients receiving vandetanib. Adding vandetanib to pemetrexed increased the incidence of some adverse events, including rash, diarrhea, and hypertension, while showing a reduced incidence of nausea, vomiting, anemia, fatigue, and asthenia with no reduction in the dose intensity of pemetrexed. CONCLUSION: This study did not meet the primary end point of statistically significant PFS prolongation with vandetanib plus pemetrexed versus placebo plus pemetrexed. The vandetanib combination showed a significantly higher objective response rate and a significant delay in the time to worsening of lung cancer symptoms versus the placebo arm as well as an acceptable safety profile in this patient population.

Enhancing surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection of propranolol with multiobjective evolutionary optimization.
Colloidal-based surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a complex technique, where interaction between multiple parameters, such as colloid type, its concentration, and aggregating agent, is poorly understood. As a result SERS has so far achieved limited reproducibility. Therefore the aim of this study was to improve enhancement and reproducibility in SERS, and to achieve this, we have developed a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) based on Pareto optimality. In this MOEA approach, we tested a combination of five different colloids with six different aggregating agents, and a wide range of concentrations for both were explored; in addition we included in the optimization process three laser excitation wavelengths. For this optimization of experimental conditions for SERS, we chose the β-adrenergic blocker drug propranolol as the target analyte. The objective functions chosen suitable for this multiobjective problem were the ratio between the full width at half-maximum and the half-maximum intensity for enhancement and correlation coefficient for reproducibility. To analyze a full search of all the experimental conditions, 7785 experiments would have to be performed empirically; however, we demonstrated the search for acceptable experimental conditions of SERS can be achieved using only 4% of these possible experiments. The MOEA identified several experimental conditions for each objective which allowed a limit of detection of 2.36 ng/mL (7.97 nM) propranolol, and this is significantly lower (>25 times) than previous SERS studies aimed at detecting this β-blocker.

A turning point for natural product discovery-ESF-EMBO research conference: synthetic biology of antibiotic production.
Synthetic Biology is in a critical phase of its development: it has finally reached the point where it can move from proof-of-principle studies to real-world applications. Secondary metabolite biosynthesis, especially the discovery and production of antibiotics, is a particularly relevant target area for such applications of synthetic biology. The first international conference to explore this subject was held in Spain in October 2011. In four sessions on General Synthetic Biology, Filamentous Fungal Systems, Actinomyces Systems, and Tools and Host Structures, scientists presented the most recent technological and scientific advances, and a final-day Forward Look Plenary Discussion identified future trends in the field. ?? 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Animal models of cognitive dysfunction and negative symptoms of schizophrenia: Focus on NMDA receptor antagonism
Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia remain an unmet clinical need. Improved understanding of the neuro- and psychopathology of these deficits depends on the availability of carefully validated animal models which will assist the development of novel therapies. There is much evidence that at least some of the pathology and symptomatology (particularly cognitive and negative symptoms) of schizophrenia results from a dysfunction of the glutamatergic system which may be modelled in animals through the use of NMDA receptor antagonists. The current review examines the validity of this model in rodents. We review the ability of acute and sub-chronic treatment with three non-competitive NMDA antagonists; phencyclidine (PCP), ketamine and MK801 (dizocilpine) to produce cognitive deficits of relevance to schizophrenia in rodents and their subsequent reversal by first- and second-generation antipsychotic drugs. Effects of NMDA receptor antagonists on the performance of rodents in behavioural tests assessing the various domains of cognition and negative symptoms are examined: novel object recognition for visual memory, reversal learning and attentional set shifting for problem solving and reasoning, 5-Choice Serial Reaction Time for attention and speed of processing; in addition to effects on social behaviour and neuropathology. The evidence strongly supports the use of NMDA receptor antagonists to model cognitive deficit and negative symptoms of schizophrenia as well as certain pathological disturbances seen in the illness. This will facilitate the evaluation of much-needed novel pharmacological agents for improved therapy of cognitive deficits and negative symptoms in schizophrenia.

Prediction of in-hospital death following aortic valve replacement: a new accurate model.
OBJECTIVES: Aortic valve replacement (AVR) is accepted as the standard treatment for severe symptomatic aortic valve stenosis and regurgitation. As novel treatments are introduced for patients at high risk for conventional surgery, it is important to have models that accurately predict procedural risk. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a risk-stratification model to predict in-hospital risk of death for patients undergoing AVR and to compare the model with existing algorithms. METHODS: We reviewed data from the Central Cardiac Adult Database, which holds prospectively collected clinical information on all adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery in National Health Service (NHS) hospitals and some private providers in the UK and Ireland. We included all the patients undergoing AVR with or without coronary artery bypass grafting. The study population consists of 55 157 patients undergoing surgery between 1 April 2001 and 31 March 2009. The model was built using data from April 2001 to March 2008 and validated using data from patients undergoing surgery from April 2008 to March 2009. The model was compared against the additive and logistic EuroSCORE models and a valve-specific risk-prediction model. RESULTS: The final multivariable model includes items describing cardiovascular risk status and procedural factors. Applying the model to the independent validation dataset provided a c-statistic (index of rank correlation) of 0.791, which was substantially better than that achieved by previously developed risk models in Europe, and significantly improved risk prediction in higher-risk patients. CONCLUSIONS: We have produced an accurate risk model to predict outcome following AVR surgery. It will be of use for patient selection and informed consent, and of particular interest in defining those patients at high risk who may benefit from novel approaches to AVR.

[delirium, day, rivastigmine, patient, group, treatment, placebo, study]

Rivastigmine in the treatment of delirium in older people: a pilot study.
BACKGROUND: Delirium is common in the elderly and is associated with high mortality and negative health outcomes. Reduced activity in the cholinergic system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of delirium. Cholinesterase inhibitors, which increase cholinergic activity, may therefore be beneficial in the treatment of delirium. METHODS: This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized pilot study of the treatment of delirium with a cholinesterase inhibitor of patients admitted to hospital medical wards. Patients over the age of 65 years were identified as having delirium by the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). Patients with delirium were randomized to receive rivastigmine 1.5 mg once a day increasing to 1.5 mg twice a day after seven days or an identical placebo (two tablets after seven days). RESULTS: Fifteen patients entered the trial; eight received rivastigmine and seven received placebo. All of the rivastigmine group, but only three of the placebo group, were negative for delirium on the CAM when they left the study and eventually discharged home. There was no significant difference in the duration of delirium between the two groups (rivastigmine group 6.3 days versus placebo group 9.9 days, p = 0.5, 95% confidence interval -15.6-8.4). CONCLUSIONS: The numbers of patients who screened positive for delirium was very small and as a result the sample size was too small to make any meaningful inferences about treatment of delirium. Despite the small numbers included in the study, there are some indicators that rivastigmine may be safe and effective in treating delirium.

Stimulation of human neutrophil phagocytosis of Candida albicans by a beta-glucan synthase inhibitor, cilofungin.
The effect of a lipopeptide antifungal agent, cilofungin, on serum opsonization and phagocytosis of Candida albicans yeast phase cells in human neutrophil monolayer assays was investigated. Simultaneous addition of fungicidal concentrations of cilofungin did not enhance or inhibit phagocytosis of C. albicans. Pretreatment of Candida blastospores with cilofungin in the absence of serum complement for 1 h did not affect phagocytosis. However, pretreatment of blastospores with cilofungin and complement promoted a significant increase in ingestion. Pretreatment of neutrophils with cilofungin in serum-free media did not affect neutrophil viability. In contrast, pre-exposure of neutrophils to cilofungin in the presence of complement inhibited ingestion of blastospores.

[incidence, melanoma, england, young, rate, age, white, north, latitude, population]

Recent melanoma incidence across England and among white residents in young people relative to adults
Purpose: Melanoma incidence continues to rise in England, particularly among white populations. Previous studies have described trends of increasing melanoma incidence with decreasing latitude; however, they have not accounted for the uneven distribution of low-risk non-white populations country-wide. We compared recent incidence rates of melanoma across regions of England in youth <25 years relative to adults, accounting for regional distribution of non-white populations.Methods: All incident primary invasive cutaneous melanomas in England, 1996–2006, were identified from national cancer registration. Region of residence at time of diagnosis was assigned as one of nine Government Office Regions (GOR) in England. Population estimates by ethnicity were obtained from national census data. Age-standardized, region-specific incidence rates (per million person-years) were calculated by sex and age group (<25, 25–54, 55–89 years) for the entire population, and for white residents.Results: During the study period, 69819 cases of melanoma were diagnosed, 1607 (2.3%) of which occurred among <25 year olds. Melanoma incidence did not follow an increasing trend from north to south latitude, most strikingly among young people. Among white residents, rates in young males varied less across the country (5–10 per million) than in young females (10–20 per million). Under age 25, young women in the North West had the highest rates of all. Among older adults, highest incidence occurred in the South West and South East but the latitude gradient was disrupted by high rates in the North West and Yorkshire and the Humber GOR in north eastern England.Conclusion: The former inverse relation of latitude of residence to melanoma incidence in England has most remarkably changed in youth under age 25. Notably, young females in the north appear to be at particularly high risk for their age group. Prevalent sunbed use and holidays abroad likely underlie these changing patterns.

[shot, microtubule, spectraplakin, protein, function, axonal, growth, tip, eb1, loss]

Spectraplakins promote microtubule-mediated axonal growth by functioning as structural microtubule-associated proteins and EB1-dependent +TIPs (tip interacting proteins).
The correct outgrowth of axons is essential for the development and regeneration of nervous systems. Axon growth is primarily driven by microtubules. Key regulators of microtubules in this context are the spectraplakins, a family of evolutionarily conserved actin-microtubule linkers. Loss of function of the mouse spectraplakin ACF7 or of its close Drosophila homolog Short stop/Shot similarly cause severe axon shortening and microtubule disorganization. How spectraplakins perform these functions is not known. Here we show that axonal growth-promoting roles of Shot require interaction with EB1 (End binding protein) at polymerizing plus ends of microtubules. We show that binding of Shot to EB1 requires SxIP motifs in Shot's C-terminal tail (Ctail), mutations of these motifs abolish Shot functions in axonal growth, loss of EB1 function phenocopies Shot loss, and genetic interaction studies reveal strong functional links between Shot and EB1 in axonal growth and microtubule organization. In addition, we report that Shot localizes along microtubule shafts and stabilizes them against pharmacologically induced depolymerization. This function is EB1-independent but requires net positive charges within Ctail which essentially contribute to the microtubule shaft association of Shot. Therefore, spectraplakins are true members of two important classes of neuronal microtubule regulating proteins: +TIPs (tip interacting proteins; plus end regulators) and structural MAPs (microtubule-associated proteins). From our data we deduce a model that relates the different features of the spectraplakin C terminus to the two functions of Shot during axonal growth.

Geometric Manipulation of the High-Field Linear Magnetoresistance in InSb Epilayers on GaAs(001)
<p>We address the inherent high-field magnetoresistance (MR) of indium antimonide epilayers on GaAs (001), studying the modification of the MR when processed into a set of geometries. The changes produced by the geometries are quite subtle. The extraordinary MR geometry produces the highest low-field MR while the Corbino geometry produces the largest high-field magnetoresistance. We demonstrate that any material with an unsaturating linear intrinsic MR, will also have an unsaturating linear Corbino MR, and that the ideal material for linear MR sensors in conventional geometries would have a high mobility and a small, linear intrinsic MR.</p>

Multiple Somatic Symptoms Predict Impaired Health Status in Functional Somatic Syndromes.
BACKGROUND: The relationship between functional somatic syndromes and multiple somatic symptoms is unclear. PURPOSE: We assessed whether the number of somatic symptoms is a predictor of health status in three functional somatic syndromes (FSS). METHODS: In a population-based study of 990 UK adults we assessed chronic widespread pain (CWP), chronic fatigue (CF) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by questionnaire and medical record data. We assessed health status (Short Form 12 and EQ-5D), number of somatic symptoms (Somatic Symptom Inventory) and anxiety/depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) both at baseline and at follow-up 1 year later. RESULTS: The proportion of people with an FSS who also have multiple somatic symptoms (52-55 %) was similar in the three functional syndromes. The presence of multiple somatic symptoms was associated with more impaired health status both at baseline and at follow-up. This finding was not explained by severity of FSS. In the absence of multiple somatic symptoms, the health status of the FSS was fair or good. In multiple regression analysis, the number of somatic symptoms, the presence of a functional syndrome (CWP or CF) and anxiety/depression were predictors of EQ-5D thermometer at follow-up after adjustment for confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple somatic symptoms in people with an FSS are associated with impaired health status and this cannot be explained by more severe functional syndrome or the presence of anxiety and depression.

Surface chemical modification of PCL films for peripheral nerve repair
Nerve injury is a very common trauma affecting 300,000 people in Europe every year.Although autografts are currently the gold standard in surgery, they can cause loss ofsensation and scar tissue formation. Artificial nerve conduits are a valid alternative forperipheral nerve repair. They can provide a confined environment during theregeneration process, enabling axons sprouting from the proximal to the distal nervesegments as well as reducing scar tissue formation. Poly-e-caprolactone (PCL) is abiocompatible and biodegradable polymer suitable for the fabrication of nerveguidances. In particular, previous works demonstrated that neural cells are able toadhere and proliferate on micropitted PCL films obtained through solvent casting. Also,short term studies showed that axons were able to bridge 1cm injury gap. In this work a18 weeks long term in vivo experiment using a rat model was performed to investigatethe reinnervation of end organ skin and muscle. PCL conduits were compared toautografts, with no significant differences in terms of regeneration and reinnervation.However, Schwann cells (SCs), the most important glial cells in the peripheral nervoussystem, showed poor attachment in vitro on PCL scaffolds; hence, surface modificationwas carried out in order to improve the material biocompatibility. The effect of bothhydrophilicity and functional groups on SCs was first investigated. PCL films were thenhydrolysed and aminolysed to modify the surface with carboxylic and amino groupsrespectively. Hydrolysed films increased remarkably the surface hydrophilicity,although topography and mechanical properties were not affected. Conversely, thetensile modulus and strength were significantly reduced by aminolysis, but still suitablefor the desired application. The two treatments influenced also the morphology of SCs.It was demonstrated that cell elongation was induced by hydrophilic surfaces, whilstcells preferred cell-cell interaction when cultured on aminolysed films. However, cellproliferation was remarkably increased on the latter surfaces, confirming previousresults obtained on substrates characterised by amino groups. These results confirmedthat a good balance between hydophilicity and surface chemistry is necessary toguarantee the best cell response. In order to enhance both proliferation and morphologyof SCs, arg-gly-asp (RGD) sequences were immobilised on the PCL film surface usingtwo different reaction mechanisms. Carbodiimide chemistry was compared to a newmechanism developed in the present study based on the Thiol chemistry. Biologicaltests performed on these modified films demonstrated the improvement of SC responseafter the peptide immobilisation using the novel approach. Cell attachment andproliferation were three times higher compared to untreated PCL films. It was alsoobserved that the presence of peptides on the film surface induced the formation of focaladhesion plaques by SCs, important for the perception of cellular signals when incontact with a particular substrate. Hence, a good balance between focal adhesion andadhesion forces was achieved after peptide immobilisation. Overall the results of thisstudy showed that material functionalisation is very important for SC response and itwill be fundamental for the production of artificial nerve conduits.

An excess of gene expression divergence on the x chromosome in drosophila embryos: Implications for the Faster-X hypothesis.
Author SummaryThere is a single copy of the X chromosome in males, yet two copies in females. This unique inheritance pattern has long been predicted to influence how the X chromosome evolves. In particular, the theory suggests that the single copy of the X in males could facilitate faster evolution of the X, although this faster evolution could be either adaptive or non-adaptive. We measured gene expression across the chromosomes in several different Drosophila species and also in several inbred strains of D. melanogaster for both embryos and adults. We found that gene expression is evolving significantly faster between species in the embryos, yet harbours significantly less variation within inbred strains. In adults, evolution between species appears to be much slower than in the embryos, yet they also harbour significantly lower levels of gene expression variation on the X chromosome in inbred strains. Overall, our results are consistent with there being an excess of adaptive evolution on the X chromosome in Drosophila embryos. Finally, we underscore the importance of biological context for understanding how chromosomes evolve in different species.

Fungal colonization of haematological patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy: emergence of azole-resistant Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Fungal colonization during cytotoxic chemotherapy was studied in 42 patients with a recent diagnosis of a haematological malignancy. In total, 2759 surveillance cultures were taken from the nostrils, throat, urine, stool and perineal region. Seven hundred and ninety-six positive surveillance cultures (28.9%) yielded 968 fungal isolates. The rate of fungal colonization did not differ between patients with acute leukaemia, patients with other haematological malignancies and control patients in the same ward at admission (71% vs. 67% vs. 80%). Patients with acute leukaemia were colonized at a significantly lower rate in samples from the throat (32%), urine (10%), stool (45%) and perineum (29%) taken during hospitalization when compared with other haematological patients (respective values 58%, 21%, 67% and 45%; P-values 0.001). This could be attributed to differences in the use of antifungal drugs. Although 21/42 (50%) of our patients had multiple-site fungal colonization at the end of follow-up, only one systemic Candida infection was diagnosed. Extensive use of antifungal treatment may have influenced the low incidence of systemic fungal infections during the follow-up. In addition to Candida species, Malassezia furfur, Geotrichum candidum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were frequently isolated. The rate of S. cerevisiae isolation increased significantly over time after admission (1%, vs. 18% of isolates, P<0.001), suggesting hospital-acquired transmission. These isolates were highly resistant to azole antifungals (MIC90 128 microg/mL for fluconazole and 16 microg/ml, for itraconazole), and caused persistent multiple site colonization in 12 patients. Extensive use of antifungal agents in a haematological ward may keep the incidence of invasive fungal infections low in spite of heavy fungal colonization. However, there may be a risk of emergence of resistant fungal strains.

A phase 2 study of SP1049C, doxorubicin in P-glycoprotein-targeting pluronics, in patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the antitumor activity of SP1049C, a novel P-glycoprotein targeting micellar formulation of doxorubicin, consisting of doxorubicin and two non-ionic block copolymers (pluronics), in patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ). Patients and METHODS: Patients with metastatic or locally advanced unresectable adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or GEJ who had not previously received systemic chemotherapy and had measurable disease were treated with SP1049C 75 mg/m(2) (doxorubicin equivalents) as a brief intravenous infusion every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate in patients who had received a least one course of SP1049C and had undergone tumor assessment, whereas, secondary endpoints included the objective response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, and safety in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. A review of scans was also conducted post-hoc by a blinded panel of radiologists. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients, of which 19 were evaluable for response, were treated with at least one dose of SP1049C. Nine patients had a partial response (PR) and eight patients had either a minor response or stable disease as their best response. The objective response rate was 47% (95% CI: 24.4-71) in the evaluable patient population, whereas the objective response rate was 43% (95% CI: 21.8-65.9) in the ITT population. The post-hoc radiological review confirmed that all nine responders had a PR; seven of the nine had a PR that was confirmed by a subsequent scan, whilst two patients had unconfirmed PRs. The median overall survival and PFS were 10.0 months (95%CI: 4.8-11.2) and 6.6 months (95% CI: 4.5-7.6), respectively. Neutropenia was the principal toxicity of SP1049C. Four patients developed an absolute percentage decrement of at least 15% in their left ventricular ejection fraction, none of which decreased to below 45% nor were symptomatic. CONCLUSION: SP1049C has a notable single-agent activity in patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and GEJ, as well as an acceptable safety profile. These results, in addition to the results of preclinical studies demonstrating superior antitumor activity of SP1049C compared with doxorubicin in a standard formulation, indicate that further evaluations of SP1049C alone or combined with other relevant therapeutics in this disease setting are warranted.

Loss-of-function mutations in SMARCE1 cause an inherited disorder of multiple spinal meningiomas.
One-third of all primary central nervous system tumors in adults are meningiomas. Rarely, meningiomas occur at multiple sites, usually occurring in individuals with type 2 neurofibromatosis (NF2). We sequenced the exomes of three unrelated individuals with familial multiple spinal meningiomas without NF2 mutations. We identified two individuals with heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex subunit gene SMARCE1. Sequencing of SMARCE1 in six further individuals with spinal meningiomas identified two additional heterozygous loss-of-function mutations. Tumors from individuals with SMARCE1 mutations were of clear-cell histological subtype, and all had loss of SMARCE1 protein, consistent with a tumor suppressor mechanism. Our findings identify multiple-spinal-meningioma disease as a new discrete entity and establish a key role for the SWI/SNF complex in the pathogenesis of both meningiomas and tumors with clear-cell histology.

FTIR microspectroscopy of selected rare diverse subvariants of carcinoma of the urinary bladder
Urothelial carcinomas of the bladder are a heterogeneous group of tumours, although some histological sub-variants are rare and sparsely reported in the literature. Diagnosis of sub-variants from conventional urothelial carcinoma can be chal-lenging, as they may mimic the morphology of other malig-nancies or benign tumours and therefore their distinction is important. For the first time, the spectral pathology of some of these sub-variants has been documented by infrared mi-crospectroscopy and an attempt made to profile their bio-chemistry. It is important not only to identify and separate the cancer-associated epithelial tissue spectra from common tis-sue features such as stroma or blood, but also to detect the signatures of tumour sub-variants. As shown, their spectro-scopic signals can change dramatically as a consequence of differentiation. Example cases are discussed and compared with histological evaluations.

Recruitment of newly diagnosed ovarian cancer patients proved challenging in a multicentre biobanking study.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the challenges of recruiting ovarian cancer patients and healthy controls to a cancer biobanking study. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The study was set up in gynecological cancer centers in 10 National Health Service trusts across the United Kingdom. Women were approached if they were undergoing investigations/awaiting treatment for ovarian cancer, had a previous diagnosis of ovarian cancer, or were attending for annual screening in an ovarian cancer screening trial. Those who consented completed a detailed epidemiologic questionnaire, provided blood and tissue samples if appropriate. RESULTS: The overall proportion of those recruited compared with the expected targets was 76.4% for healthy controls, 86.0% for old cases, and 46.9% for new cases. Only 4 of 10 (40%) centers recruited over 50% of their target for new cases. Unwillingness to participate was reported as primarily because of patients being too unwell, wanting to focus only on their treatment, or having insufficient time because of conflicting medical appointments. Concerns about use of personal data or tissue and blood samples for genetic research and lack of direct benefit were reported as significant challenges to recruitment. CONCLUSION: When setting recruitment targets for patients undergoing investigations or awaiting treatment for cancer (new cases), it is important to consider lower response rates because of various patient, logistical, and trial-specific challenges.

[nanotube, membrane, macrophage, bacterium, traffic, thick, thin]

Structurally distinct membrane nanotubes between human macrophages support long-distance vesicular traffic or surfing of bacteria.
We report that two classes of membrane nanotubes between human monocyte-derived macrophages can be distinguished by their cytoskeletal structure and their functional properties. Thin membrane nanotubes contained only F-actin, whereas thicker nanotubes, i.e., those > approximately 0.7 microm in diameter, contained both F-actin and microtubules. Bacteria could be trapped and surf along thin, but not thick, membrane nanotubes toward connected macrophage cell bodies. Once at the cell body, bacteria could then be phagocytosed. The movement of bacteria is aided by a constitutive flow of the nanotube surface because streptavidin-coated beads were similarly able to traffic along nanotubes between surface-biotinylated macrophages. Mitochondria and intracellular vesicles, including late endosomes and lysosomes, could be detected within thick, but not thin, membrane nanotubes. Analysis from kymographs demonstrated that vesicles moved in a stepwise, bidirectional manner at approximately 1 microm/s, consistent with their traffic being mediated by the microtubules found only in thick nanotubes. Vesicular traffic in thick nanotubes and surfing of beads along thin nanotubes were both stopped upon the addition of azide, demonstrating that both processes require ATP. However, microtubule destabilizing agents colchicine or nocodazole abrogated vesicular transport but not the flow of the nanotube surface, confirming that distinct cytoskeletal structures of nanotubes give rise to different functional properties. Thus, membrane nanotubes between macrophages are more complex than unvarying ubiquitous membrane tethers and facilitate several means for distal interactions between immune cells.

[tidal, bottom, flow, velocity, layer, current, mean, boundary, bank, flank]

The vertical structure of the bottom boundary layer on the southern flank of the George Bank during late winter
The bottom boundary layer structure on the southern flank of Georges Bank was
investigated for the period February 19 to March 20, 1995. During this time, vertical
stratification was weak and the near bottom waters were almost homogeneous.
Georges Bank is a region of strong tidal currents, with the dominant constituent, the
M2, carrying most of the tidal energy. A clockwise around-bank circulation is present
throughout the year, with flow directions being to the southwest along the southern
flank, and to the northeast along the northern flank. Main generation mechanisms of
the mean circulation are tidal rectification over the sloping bottom, horizontal stratification,
and, along the continental shelf, flow associated with upstream sources including
the Labrador Current. Due to the effects of winter cooling, cross-bank density gradients
are weak during winter, and the clockwise mean flow is smallest during the cold
seasons.
Velocity, temperature, and salinity data were taken at Stratification Site 1 (40°51'N,
67°33'W) located on the 76 m isobath 30 km upslope of the shelf slope front. The
M2 pressure gradient was almost rectilinear and across-bank, forcing a current ellipse
with eccentricity e ≈ 0.62 and depth-averaged current amplitudes of ≈ 40 cm/s. The
magnitude of the depth-averaged mean flow is 9 ± 5 cm/s for the period investigated
and small compared to the tidal currents. Estimates of friction velocities and bottom
roughness were obtained from best-fit logarithmic profiles to velocity measurements
taken between 0.28 and 2.5 m above the sea floor.
Boundary layer heights for the tidal and subtidal flows were derived from profiles
of the M2 and low-pass filtered currents. Meaningful parameterizations of these heights
were found from the equations of motion assuming a logarithmic velocity region in the
vicinity of the sea floor as suggested by the observations. Scaling arguments show
that the mean and tidal flows interact through the effects of bottom friction, with the
largest part of the turbulent fluctuations being set by the M2 tide. Scaling arguments for the tidal boundary layer height were discussed with respect to earlier results by
Soulsby (1990). Integrated velocity defects were computed for the M2 and low-pass
filtered flow, and compared to boundary layer transports predicted by the estimated
bottom stress. Closer investigation of subtidal velocity defects reveals the importance
of advective terms in the time-averaged along-bank momentum equation, in agreement
with previous studies (Zimmermann, 1980; Loder, 1980; Huthnance, 1981) discussing
the nonlinear character of tidal rectification.
In a numerical modeling study, the performance of a simple one-dimensional,
two-layer model was examined. Numerical mixing coefficients were parameterized according
to K = K-u*z in the sublayer z ≤ l, and K = K-u*l in the rest of the
water column, where -u* is the mean friction velocity during one tidal cycle. Based on
the comparison of model solutions to observations, a characteristic parameterization
for the sublayer thickness was derived, suggesting optimal values for l to be similar
to the observed logarithmic layer height l ≈ 5 m. Numerical predictions using the
Mellor-Yamada level 2.5 turbulence closure were also investigated. The performance
of this advanced closure scheme was found to be less convincing than results from the
much simpler two-layer model.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution September 1996This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under grant OCE 93-13671 as part of the U.S. GLOBEC/Georges Bank Program

Understanding the attitudes of hospital pharmacists to reporting medication incidents: A qualitative study.
BACKGROUND: The attitudes of doctors, nurses, and midwives to reporting errors in health care have been extensively studied, but there is very limited literature considering pharmacists' attitudes to medication error reporting schemes, in particular in hospitals. OBJECTIVES: To explore and understand the attitudes of hospital pharmacists to reporting medication incidents. METHODS: Focus groups were conducted with a total of 17 hospital pharmacists from 4 purposively sampled hospitals in the North West of England. The recordings of the focus groups were transcribed verbatim and subject to thematic analysis using a framework analysis approach. RESULTS: Pharmacists agreed that the high prevalence of medication errors, especially prescribing errors of omission, has led to an acceptance of not using hospital reporting systems. There were different personal thresholds for reporting medication errors but pharmacists agreed that the severity of any patient harm was the primary reporting driver. Hospital pharmacists had specific anxieties about the effects of reporting on interprofessional working relationships with doctors and nurses, but felt more confident to report if they had previously witnessed positive feedback and system change following an error. Existing reporting forms were considered too cumbersome and time consuming to complete, as pharmacists felt the need to find and record every possible detail. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital pharmacists understood the importance of reporting medication incidents, but because of the high number of errors they encounter do not report them as often as may be expected. The decision to report was a complex process that depended on the severity of patient harm, anxieties about harming interprofessional relationships, prior experience of the outcomes from reporting, and the perceived effort required to use reporting forms.

[irritant, response, skin, epidermal]

Investigation of TNF-alpha release as a measure of skin irritancy.
Contact dermatitis is by far the most frequently reported occupational disease, with irritant dermatitis accounting for up to 80% of all cases. A wide variety of materials are capable of causing skin inflammation including soaps, cosmetics, pesticides, organic dyes, solvents and industrial chemicals and wastes. Skin irritation results from a complex series of events involving the development of an inflammatory response at the site of exposure. Cytokines are a family of proteins and glycoproteins that regulate immune and inflammatory responses; many are produced by epidermal cells. The present study examines the response of mouse epidermal strips to the cutaneous irritant sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). A time-dependent relationship was established for the release of the cytokine tumour necrosis factor-alpha, from epidermal keratinocytes after treatment with 20% SDS. The potential value of this methodology for the detection of cutaneous irritants has been established. The utility of the approach for the identification in vitro of other materials of known in vivo irritant potential will be investigated.

Prior exposure to live Mycobacterium bovis BCG decreases Cryptococcus neoformans-induced lung eosinophilia in a gamma interferon-dependent manner.
Some common childhood infections appear to prevent the development of atopy and asthma. In some Mycobacterium bovis BCG-vaccinated populations, strong delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to mycobacterial antigens are associated with a reduced risk of atopy. Although BCG exposure decreases allergen-induced lung eosinophilia in animal models, little attention has been given to the effect of immunity to BCG on responses against live pathogens. We used the murine Cryptococcus neoformans infection model to investigate whether prior BCG infection can alter such responses. The present study shows that persistent pulmonary BCG infection of C57BL/6 mice induced an increase in gamma interferon, a reduction in interleukin-5, and a decrease in lung eosinophilia during subsequent Cryptococcus infection. This effect was long lasting, depended on the presence of live bacteria, and required persistence of mycobacterial infection in the lung. Reduction of eosinophilia was less prominent after infection with a mutant BCG strain (DeltahspR), which was rapidly cleared from the lungs. These observations have important implications for the development of vaccines designed to prevent Th2-mediated disease and indicate that prior lung BCG vaccination can alter the pattern of subsequent host inflammation.

[psoriasis, standard, gold, therapy, treatment, question, comparator, survey, active, continuous]

Improving clinical trial design in psoriasis: Perspectives from the global dermatology community.
BACKGROUND: Clinical trials to test investigational drugs for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis currently lack standards for comparison of efficacy and safety data.The majority of studies do not address the important need for long-term treatment. METHODS: The International Psoriasis Council (IPC) conducted two surveys of its members to assess the need for gold standards, active comparators, and long-term therapy in clinical trials. In Survey 1, 30 participants delivered viewpoints on active comparators for topical therapy (six questions), systemic therapy (nine questions), and continuous versus intermittent therapy (six questions). In Survey 2, 31 participants provided input on gold standards for treatment (five questions), appropriate comparators (four questions), and continuous versus intermittent therapy (six questions). The IPC leadership interpreted the results after each survey. RESULTS: The majority of participants (77% in Survey 1 and 89% in Survey 2) agreed that studies of investigative treatments should include an active comparator. Participants described the most important feature of a gold standard as a treatment that: is widely used and generally accepted (45%); has the best efficacy (42%); and is well tolerated (13%). The majority agreed that gold standards should be dependent on: patient subgroup; location/extent of psoriasis; and psoriasis subtype/morphology. It was also agreed that continuous therapy for more than 3 years is needed for patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. We have provided an expert opinion regarding the definition of a gold standard in psoriasis and have also established that no single treatment can be the gold standard across all subgroups and types of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: A single gold standard for the treatment of psoriasis does not exist. The complexity and heterogeneity of psoriasis requires different gold standards for the various manifestations of psoriasis and for subgroups of patients reconciling comorbidities. Of note, 17 experts out of 30 selected methotrexate as the most nominated gold standard amongst systemic agents. The experts support the election of an active comparator as one that is most efficacious over just the best in a particular class. In concordance, 87% of respondents agreed that good tolerability is therefore not the lead criterion for selection of an active comparator in favor of effectiveness and broad use. Patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis require continuous therapy; this statement was supported by 93% of the experts. Reasons for considering long-term therapy included appearance of comorbidities, impairment of quality of life, possibility of relapse, and subjective complaints such as itch, pain, and joint disease.

[glutamine, cell, cancer, autophagy, fibroblast, mcf7, tumor]

Glutamine fuels a vicious cycle of autophagy in the tumor stroma and oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in epithelial cancer cells: implications for preventing chemotherapy resistance.
Glutamine metabolism is crucial for cancer cell growth via the generation of intermediate molecules in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, antioxidants and ammonia. The goal of the current study was to evaluate the effects of glutamine on metabolism in the breast cancer tumor microenvironment, with a focus on autophagy and cell death in both epithelial and stromal compartments. For this purpose, MCF7 breast cancer cells were cultured alone or co-cultured with non-transformed fibroblasts in media containing high glutamine and low glucose (glutamine +) or under control conditions, with no glutamine and high glucose (glutamine -). Here, we show that MCF7 cells maintained in co-culture with glutamine display increased mitochondrial mass, as compared with control conditions. Importantly, treatment with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine abolishes the glutamine-induced augmentation of mitochondrial mass. It is known that loss of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) expression in fibroblasts is associated with increased autophagy and an aggressive tumor microenvironment. Here, we show that Cav-1 downregulation which occurs in fibroblasts maintained in co-culture specifically requires glutamine. Interestingly, glutamine increases the expression of autophagy markers in fibroblasts, but decreases expression of autophagy markers in MCF7 cells, indicating that glutamine regulates the autophagy program in a compartment-specific manner. Functionally, glutamine protects MCF7 cells against apoptosis, via the upregulation of the anti-apoptotic and anti-autophagic protein TIGAR. Also, we show that glutamine cooperates with stromal fibroblasts to confer tamoxifen-resistance in MCF7 cancer cells. Finally, we provide evidence that co-culture with fibroblasts (1) promotes glutamine catabolism, and (2) decreases glutamine synthesis in MCF7 cancer cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that autophagic fibroblasts may serve as a key source of energy-rich glutamine to fuel cancer cell mitochondrial activity, driving a vicious cycle of catabolism in the tumor stroma and anabolic tumor cell expansion.

Investigating the stability of neuropsychiatric sub-syndromes with progression of dementia: a 2-year prospective study.
OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have identified sub-syndromes of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. But because of their cross-sectional design, the stability of these sub-syndromes over time remains unknown. METHOD: Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia of 84 participants (out of an original sample of 144 patients) with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia were assessed by using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory every six months for two years. Principal component factor analysis with Varimax rotation was used to detect neuropsychiatric sub-syndromes at each time point. RESULTS: The 12 symptoms were reduced to four factors at baseline, 12, 18, and 24 months and three factors at six months. None of the factor structures matched the four sub-syndromes previously identified by studies. The most stable group of symptoms were a combination of "psychosis" and "hyperactivity" symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, irritability, agitation), which became stable at 18 months. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia sub-syndromes over time has not been studied before, and this research suggests that some stability is evident particularly during the later stages of the disease process. These findings have implications for patients and their caregiver. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

[variable, interaction, mechanistic]

Deep determinism and the assessment of mechanistic interaction
Given two variables that causally influence a binary response, we formalize the idea that their effects operate through a common mechanism, in which case we say that the two variables interact mechanistically. We introduce a mechanistic interaction relationship of "interference" that is asymmetric in the two causal factors. Conditions and assumptions under which such mechanistic interaction can be tested under a given regime of data collection, be it interventional or observational, are expressed in terms of conditional independence relationships between the problem variables, which can be manipulated with the aid of causal diagrams. The proposed method is able, under appropriate conditions, to test for interaction between direct effects, and to deal with the situation where one of the two factors is a dichotomized version of a continuous variable. The method is illustrated with the aid of a study on heart disease.

Extraction and Analysis of Interstitial Fluid, and Characterisation of the Interstitial Compartment in Kidney Disease
Patients with kidney disease lose the ability to remove poisonous substances and fluids from their body, causing these to accumulate. The accumulation of these toxins and fluid contributes the high mortality seen with kidney disease. Dialysis aims to remove these toxins but only addresses the blood compartment, which represents less than 7% of body fluids. The assumption, that toxins are equality distributed in body fluid compartments may be wrong, and as such lead to poor removal of toxins by dialysis and their accumulation in compartments such as interstitial or tissue fluid. Tissue fluid composition is unknown in kidney disease patients. This study looked at tissue fluid levels of certain toxins like urea, creatinine, uric acid and phosphate and found them to be different from their blood levels. During dialysis, removal of these toxins from blood was not matched by their removal from tissue fluid, indicating that such toxins may be poorly removed from tissue fluid by dialysis. We measured body fluid volumes in these patients and found that tissue fluid volume was markedly increased, more than 7 times the blood fluid volume in most patients. This means that tissue fluid is a large toxin and fluid reservoir in kidney patients, and that the current blood-based approach to measuring toxins and removing them may be flawed. Extraction of tissue fluid can be quite challenging. We developed microneedles (tiny needles) and showed that these could be used to extract tissue fluid from skin, without causing pain or bleeding. Development of such technology will improve understanding of tissue fluid and perhaps lead to remote monitoring at home, using microneedle patches to extract tissue fluid. We also used a small electric current to successfully extract urea (a toxin that accumulates in kidney failure) from the skin, as a possible screening and monitoring method for kidney disease. This study shows that blood measurements do not necessarily reflect other body fluids (tissue fluid). This implies that blood-based measurements of toxins and their removal by dialysis may be fundamentally flawed. More research on tissue fluid will help to better understand toxicity in kidney failure and maybe help in designing better methods of toxin removal

Creating a tumor-resistant microenvironment: cell-mediated delivery of TNFα completely prevents breast cancer tumor formation in vivo.
Here, we provide the necessary proof of concept, that it is possible to metabolically create a non-permissive or "hostile" stromal microenvironment, which actively prevents tumor engraftment in vivo. We developed a novel genetically engineered fibroblast cell line that completely prevents tumor formation in mice, with a 100% protection rate. No host side effects were apparent. This could represent a viable cellular strategy for preventing and treating a variety of human cancers. More specifically, we examined the autocrine and paracrine effects of the cellular delivery of TNFα on breast cancer tumor growth and cancer metabolism. For this purpose, we recombinantly overexpressed TNFα in human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) or human immortalized fibroblasts (hTERT-BJ1). Our results directly show that TNFα functions as a potent tumor suppressor. Remarkably, TNFα-expressing breast cancer cells were viable, without any significant increases in their basal apoptotic rate. However, after 4 weeks post-implantation, TNFα-expressing breast cancer cells failed to form any tumors in xenografted mice (0 tumors/10 injections), ultimately conferring 100% protection against tumorigenesis. Similarly, TNFα-overexpressing fibroblasts were also viable, without any increases in apoptosis. Significantly, complete tumor suppression was obtained by co-injecting TNFα expressing stromal fibroblasts with human breast cancer cells, indicating that paracrine cell-mediated delivery of TNFα can also prevent tumor engraftment and growth (0 tumors/10 injections). Mechanistically, TNFα induced autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction in both epithelial cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts, preventing energy transfer from the tumor microenvironment, likely "starving" the cancer cells to death. In addition, via qRT-PCR analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells, we observed that TNFα mediated the upregulation of gene transcripts associated with inflammation and senescence IL-1-β, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, COX-2, p21(WAF1/CIP1) and downregulated known tumor-promoting genes (collagen VI and MMP2). Recombinant overexpression of TNFα receptor(s) in MDA-MB-231 cells also significantly reduced tumor growth, but was not as effective as the TNFα ligand itself in preventing tumor growth. Thus, we propose that stromal cell-mediated delivery of TNFα to human tumors using transfected fibroblasts or mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) may be a novel and effective strategy for the prevention and treatment of human cancers.

<p>This paper reports on the findings of a research project investigating the nature of participation of secondary school students in a collaborative research programme. Four groups of students, aged 14 to 15 years old, from a secondary school in the United Kingdom (UK) participated in the study. The students involved in the programme took the role of researchers investigating their peers’ perceptions of climate change using video to visually record their findings. University researchers worked collaboratively with the school students and a teacher from the school through an approach that empowered the students within the research process. Drawing from the ideas and issues raised from an initial briefing session, each group of students developed a short interview schedule to be used whilst investigating the views of their peers. Although the project was on a small scale, the data gathered from the brainstorming activity, video reports and reflective discussions provided a useful snap shot of how the participating students perceived their experience and the nature of their involvement in the research process. The research approach enabled students to take on the role of investigator when interviewing their peers and to offer a voice for both themselves and their peers. Introduction</p>

MEDIATORS OF INFLAMMATION IN ACUTE NEUROTOXICITY
Neuroinflammation is a major feature of most neurodegenerative conditions, and can leadto the exacerbation of neuronal injury. Inflammatory challenges in the central nervoussystem (CNS) have been shown to activate peripheral immune cells, which subsequentlyinfiltrate into the brain. Concurrently, resident inflammatory cells in the CNS, such asmicroglia, become activated and release inflammatory mediators, including cytokines.The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a key mediator of neuronal injury.Although two IL-1 agonists exist, IL-1α and IL-1β, the majority of research has focussedon the contribution of IL-1β to neuronal injury. Excitotoxic cell death in the rat brain,induced by striatal injection of the glutamate agonist AMPA, is exacerbated by coadministrationof recombinant IL-1β. To identify possible mediators which facilitate theexacerbation of neuronal injury by IL-1 this study investigated the early peripheral andcentral mediators of inflammation in response to AMPA + IL-1β.Neutrophil infiltration and increased neuronal activity were found to be present at 4h post-AMPA + IL-1β injection, which lead to the induction of microglial IL-1α in the ipsilateralcortex, in the absence of any IL-1β expression. To target the peripheral neutrophil responsean intervention study was performed to inhibit peripheral TNFα, which is thought tomobilise neutrophils. No significant effect of pre-treatment with etanercept, a TNFαinhibitor, was observed on neuronal injury produced in response to AMPA + IL-1β, thougha slight trend for protection was seen. To target the central IL-1α response after AMPA +IL-1β treatment an anti-IL-1α antibody was injected directly into the cerebral cortex, butthis had no effect on AMPA + IL-1β induced cell death. Therefore, using a reductionist invitro approach in organotypic slice cultures haemin, an inducer of endogenous IL-1α, wasused to investigate IL-1α mediated cell death. Haemin induced cell death was shown to beIL-1 dependent and preliminary studies using IL-1αKO mice indicated that IL-1α maypartially mediate this effect. This suggests that in the AMPA + IL-1β paradigm IL-1α is thedominant IL-1 isoform early after AMPA + IL-1β treatment, which can trigger subsequentneuronal cell death, as a result of the additive effects of neutrophil infiltration and highneuronal activity in the cortex. This study highlights the potential therapeutic value ofinhibiting IL-1α expression early following acute neuronal injury.

[cardiac, hypertrophy, c-rel, subunit, heart]

The NF-κB subunit c-Rel stimulates cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis.
Cardiac remodeling and hypertrophy are the pathological consequences of cardiovascular disease and are correlated with its associated mortality. Activity of the transcription factor NF-κB is increased in the diseased heart; however, our present understanding of how the individual subunits contribute to cardiovascular disease is limited. We assign a new role for the c-Rel subunit as a stimulator of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. We discovered that c-Rel-deficient mice have smaller hearts at birth, as well as during adulthood, and are protected from developing cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis after chronic angiotensin infusion. Results of both gene expression and cross-linked chromatin immunoprecipitation assay analyses identified transcriptional activators of hypertrophy, myocyte enhancer family, Gata4, and Tbx proteins as Rel gene targets. We suggest that the p50 subunit could limit the prohypertrophic actions of c-Rel in the normal heart, because p50 overexpression in H9c2 cells repressed c-Rel levels and the absence of cardiac p50 was associated with increases in both c-Rel levels and cardiac hypertrophy. We report for the first time that c-Rel is highly expressed and confined to the nuclei of diseased adult human hearts but is restricted to the cytoplasm of normal cardiac tissues. We conclude that c-Rel-dependent signaling is critical for both cardiac remodeling and hypertrophy. Targeting its activities could offer a novel therapeutic strategy to limit the effects of cardiac disease.

BIOMECHANICS OF THE HUMANFOREARM IN HEALTH AND DISEASE
Introduction:The forearm is a complex biological unit, which has allowed man’sevolution. This PhD commenced with an analysis of the normal biomechanicalfunctioning of the key components of the forearm: notably the distal radioulnarjoint (DRUJ), interosseous ligament (IOL) and proximal radioulnar joint (PRUJ).Understanding normal forearm physiology, a clinical study followed to delineatethe pathophysiology of a new clinical entity, related to DRUJ dysfunction.Methods:BIOMECHANICAL STUDY: A biomechanical testing jig was developed tofacilitate collection of data about normal functioning of the DRUJ, IOL andPRUJ in both unloaded and loaded states. This permitted testing throughoutthe range of forearm pronosupination. Thawed fresh frozen cadaveric upperlimbs were mounted into the jig. Using Microstrain® strain gauges andTekscan™ pressure sensors, the functional anatomy of the key components ofthe forearm was delineated, both with the forearm flexed at 90° and maximallyextended at the elbow.CLINICAL STUDY: A series of 3-Tesla MRI scans was undertaken on patientssymptomatic of an intermittent ulnar neuropathy. The causative pathophysiologywas determined using 3D qualitative and quantitative analyses.ResultsBIOMECHANICAL STUDY: Reproducible patterns of force transmitted and jointcontact area have been determined for the DRUJ, and for the first time, thePRUJ. With the exception of PMax and P60 for the PRUJ, application of loadincreases contact areas and transmitted forces across the joints (P<0.05). Theconverse is true for PMax and P60 in the PRUJ.The IOL is lax during pronation, strain gradually increasing as the armmoves to neutral. In neutral the middle-portion of the IOL (m-IOL) demonstratesmost strain, this decreasing again in supination, whilst the distal and proximalportions (d- & p-IOL) exhibit more strain (P<0.05).

A clinical entity of a dysfunctional forearm has been defined, calledsubluxation-related ulnar neuropathy or SUN syndrome. Finally, a new clinicaldevice has been developed, which it is anticipated will translate into visibleimprovements in patient care.

[ispaghulum, placebo, bowel, patient, syndrome, transit, time, group, irritable]

Double blind study of ispaghula in irritable bowel syndrome.
A double blind placebo controlled trial of ispaghula husk in 80 patients with irritable bowel syndrome is reported. Global assessment judged treatment to be satisfactory in 82% of patients receiving ispaghula and 53% of the placebo group (p less than 0.02). Bowel habit was unchanged in the placebo group, while constipation significantly improved in patients taking ispaghula (p = 0.026). Transit time decreased significantly in those taking ispaghula compared with placebo (p = 0.001), especially in patients with initially high transit times. Abdominal pain and bloating improved in both groups, with no significant differences between ispaghula and placebo. Four of the eight withdrawals on ispaghula and 10 of the 15 withdrawals on placebo were because of treatment failure. Ispaghula significantly improves overall well being in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, and in those with constipation favourably affects bowel habit and transit time.

(Re)Politicizing inflation policy: A global political economy perspective
This article investigates the political and social outcomes of low-inflation policy as it relates to labour market policy and wages. Current policy orthodoxy assumes there are indomitable negative costs associated with inflation; as such, Central Banks are tasked with maintain price stability to ensure economic growth and global competitiveness. Critical political economists challenge in  these assumptions tend to focus almost exclusively on the ambiguous relationships between low inflation, monetary policy and real economic growth. Examining the politics of low-inflation policy and labour market reform adds a new dimension to this critical research agenda. Using the United States and the United Kingdom as case studies, two policies designed to control inflation and adopted as part of labour market reform are examined: promoting increased product market competition and indexing wage increases to price levels using the consumer price index (CPI). These two policies reveal how controlling wage-led inflation, and all the related distributional outcomes, at the heart of low inflation policy. Finally, with inflation rates rising quickly across the US and the UK the politics of inflation have again entered the public domain. Again, we see that policy makers are looking to labour markets, not monetary policy, to quell inflationary pressures. Wage-earners must take real wage cuts to ensure a rebounding of economic growth. For all intense and purposes, it appears the politics and vigilance against wage-led inflation is paramount in Anglo-America, whether the actual inflation rate is low or high.

[cav1, melanoma, cell, b16f10, expression]

CAV1 inhibits metastatic potential in melanomas through suppression of the integrin/Src/FAK signaling pathway.
Caveolin-1 (CAV1) is the main structural component of caveolae, which are plasma membrane invaginations that participate in vesicular trafficking and signal transduction events. Although evidence describing the function of CAV1 in several cancer types has recently accumulated, its role in melanoma tumor formation and progression remains poorly explored. Here, by using B16F10 melanoma cells as an experimental system, we directly explore the function of CAV1 in melanoma tumor growth and metastasis. We first show that CAV1 expression promotes proliferation, whereas it suppresses migration and invasion of B16F10 cells in vitro. When orthotopically implanted in the skin of mice, B16F10 cells expressing CAV1 form tumors that are similar in size to their control counterparts. An experimental metastasis assay shows that CAV1 expression suppresses the ability of B16F10 cells to form lung metastases in C57Bl/6 syngeneic mice. Additionally, CAV1 protein and mRNA levels are found to be significantly reduced in human metastatic melanoma cell lines and human tissue from metastatic lesions. Finally, we show that following integrin activation, B16F10 cells expressing CAV1 display reduced expression levels and activity of FAK and Src proteins. Furthermore, CAV1 expression markedly reduces the expression of integrin β(3) in B16F10 melanoma cells. In summary, our findings provide experimental evidence that CAV1 may function as an antimetastatic gene in malignant melanoma.

Beam Dynamics Using Graphical Processing Units
Simulation of particle beam dynamics in accelerators 
is computationally expensive, and requires ray-tracing of 
high numbers of particles to ensure the accuracy of the re- 
sult, to model collective effects and to reduce the statistical 
error. Conventional beam tracking tools operate sequen- 
tially on particle phase space to compute the trajectories of 
particles through many turns around circular and along lin- 
ear machines. Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) utilise 
stream processing techniques to dramatically speed up par- 
allel computational tasks, and offer considerable perfor- 
mance benefits to particle beam dynamics processing. In 
this paper, the application of stream processing to beam 
dynamics is presented, along with the GPU-based beam 
dynamics code GPMAD, which exploits the NVidia 1 
GPU processor and demonstrates the considerable perfor- 
mance benefits to particle tracking calculations. The accu- 
racy and speed of GPMAD is benchmarked using the DIA- 
MOND 2 Light Source BTS lattice, and the ATF extrac- 
tion line. 
stream processing language. 
Early GPUs had closed architectures designed specif- 
ically for rendering, but later architectures were opened 
up, allowing exploitation for alternative purposes. General 
Purpose computation using GPUs (GPGPU) developed, 
leading to an array of programming languages. Examples 
of GPU-based programming languages are Brook 4 and 
CUDA 5. 
Accelerator Physics and Stream Processing 
The beam dynamics of the motion of particles through an 
accelerator is well suited to stream processing techniques. 
The motion is modelled by representing a particle as a point 
in a 6-dimensioanl phase space, with positions (x,y,&#964; ), as- 
sociated canonical momenta (p x,py ,pt ) and phase space

Feminist Political Thought
This course focuses on a range of theories of gender in modern life. In recent years feminist scholars in a range of disciplines have challenged previously accepted notions of political theory such as the distinctions between public and private, the definitions of politics itself, the nature of citizenship, and the roles of women in civil society. In this course we will examine different aspects of women's lives through the life cycle as seen from the vantage point of political theory. In addition we will consider different ways of looking at power and political culture in modern societies, issues of race and class, poverty and welfare, sexuality and morality.

Management of the patient and family with neurofibromatosis 2: a consensus conference statement.
A consensus conference on neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) was held in 2002 at the request of the United Kingdom (UK) Neurofibromatosis Association, with particular emphasis on vestibular schwannoma (VS) surgery. NF2 patients should be managed at specialty treatment centres, whose staff has extensive experience with the disease. All NF2 patients and their families should have access to genetic testing because presymptomatic diagnosis improves the clinical management of the disease. Some clinical manifestations of NF2, such as ocular abnormalities, can be detected in infancy; therefore, clinical screening for at-risk members of NF2 families can start at birth, with the first magnetic resonance (MRI) scan at 10-12 years of age. Minimal interference, maintenance of quality of life, and conservation of function or auditory rehabilitation are the cornerstones of NF2 management, and the decision points to achieve these goals for patients with different clinical presentations are discussed.

[parent, child, treatment, decision-making, social]

'Doing the "right" thing': how parents experience and manage decision-making for children's 'normalising' surgeries.
Using cleft lip and palate as an exemplar, this article examines parents' decision-making for children in the context of elective treatments which aim to 'normalise' a child's function, appearance, communication or identity. Using purposive and theoretical sampling, 35 parents with children from infancy to young adulthood were recruited through a specialist cleft centre in England. Parents were interviewed in-depth between 2006 and 2008 about their beliefs and motivations in relation to treatment decision-making in this context. A grounded theory approach was used to analyse the data. Findings revealed a core category, 'doing the "right" thing', that encapsulated parents' main concern in relation to their children's treatment and highlighted several emotional, social and cultural considerations underpinning their decision-making stance. Parents fulfilled a perceived 'moral' obligation to be 'good' parents by pursuing the 'normalising' treatments, particularly surgeries, made available to their children. Such treatments were viewed as a way of facilitating their child's social inclusion and helping them reach their full potential. In order to enable their continued pursuit of treatments over the long-term, parents also constructed specialist practitioners as highly competent and particularly trustworthy. This article captures the complexities involved in parents' decision-making for children's elective 'normalising' treatments, where both functional and appearance-related concerns are involved. It suggests that social norms about parenting, physical appearance and healthcare practitioner power may significantly shape decision-making in this context, so that such choices may be viewed primarily as 'moral' rather than social. Services could support parents with such challenges, by gauging their needs for information about surgery and its likely outcomes and providing emotional/decisional support to consider all available options.

Qualities of life, educational level and human development: an international investigation of health.
INTRODUCTION AND METHODS: This study investigated the relationship between health-related quality of life (QoL), educational level and culture, using a high quality cross-cultural generic measure (WHOQOL-BREF) containing 25 international dimensions organised in physical, psychological, social and environmental domains. RESULTS: Cross-cultural data from 9,404 sick and well adults in 13 countries showed that environmental QoL increased positively and sequentially from no education to tertiary education. The other three domains increased only up to secondary school level. These MANCOVA results were significantly influenced by health status, age, culture and economic development level. More positive feelings, less dependence on medication and treatment, better perceptions of financial resources, physical environment, and opportunities for information and skills, represent adult QoL advantages to those who received tertiary education compared with secondary schooling. Developing countries reported poorer environmental, psychological and physical QoL than developed countries, although social QoL was good, and no different for the two development bands. Only psychological QoL distinguished between every educational level, in developing countries. Increased positive feelings serve to link better mental health with more education. Across each domain, secondary and tertiary education was associated with better QoL in developing countries. CONCLUSION: The results support a QoL case for universal secondary education on which better health and health care may be built.

[cell, kir, phosphorylation, synapse, killer, immune, receptor, inhibitory, nk, signaling]

Microclusters of inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptor signaling at natural killer cell immunological synapses.
We report the supramolecular organization of killer Ig-like receptor (KIR) phosphorylation using a technique applicable to imaging phosphorylation of any green fluorescent protein-tagged receptor at an intercellular contact or immune synapse. Specifically, we use fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) to report Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between GFP-tagged KIR2DL1 and a Cy3-tagged generic anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody. Visualization of KIR phosphorylation in natural killer (NK) cells contacting target cells expressing cognate major histocompatibility complex class I proteins revealed that inhibitory signaling is spatially restricted to the immune synapse. This explains how NK cells respond appropriately when simultaneously surveying susceptible and resistant target cells. More surprising, phosphorylated KIR was confined to microclusters within the aggregate of KIR, contrary to an expected homogeneous distribution of KIR signaling across the immune synapse. Also, yellow fluorescent protein-tagged Lck, a kinase important for KIR phosphorylation, accumulated in a multifocal distribution at inhibitory synapses. Spatial confinement of receptor phosphorylation within the immune synapse may be critical to how activating and inhibitory signals are integrated in NK cells.

[cancer, cell, gene, lactate, ketone, metabolism, breast, transcriptional, metabolite, outcome]

Ketones and lactate increase cancer cell "stemness," driving recurrence, metastasis and poor clinical outcome in breast cancer: achieving personalized medicine via Metabolo-Genomics.
Previously, we showed that high-energy metabolites (lactate and ketones) "fuel" tumor growth and experimental metastasis in an in vivo xenograft model, most likely by driving oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in breast cancer cells. To mechanistically understand how these metabolites affect tumor cell behavior, here we used genome-wide transcriptional profiling. Briefly, human breast cancer cells (MCF7) were cultured with lactate or ketones, and then subjected to transcriptional analysis (exon-array). Interestingly, our results show that treatment with these high-energy metabolites increases the transcriptional expression of gene profiles normally associated with "stemness," including genes upregulated in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Similarly, we observe that lactate and ketones promote the growth of bonafide ES cells, providing functional validation. The lactate- and ketone-induced "gene signatures" were able to predict poor clinical outcome (including recurrence and metastasis) in a cohort of human breast cancer patients. Taken together, our results are consistent with the idea that lactate and ketone utilization in cancer cells promotes the "cancer stem cell" phenotype, resulting in significant decreases in patient survival. One possible mechanism by which these high-energy metabolites might induce stemness is by increasing the pool of Acetyl-CoA, leading to increased histone acetylation, and elevated gene expression. Thus, our results mechanistically imply that clinical outcome in breast cancer could simply be determined by epigenetics and energy metabolism, rather than by the accumulation of specific "classical" gene mutations. We also suggest that high-risk cancer patients (identified by the lactate/ketone gene signatures) could be treated with new therapeutics that target oxidative mitochondrial metabolism, such as the anti-oxidant and "mitochondrial poison" metformin. Finally, we propose that this new approach to personalized cancer medicine be termed "Metabolo-Genomics," which incorporates features of both 1) cell metabolism and 2) gene transcriptional profiling. Importantly, this powerful new approach directly links cancer cell metabolism with clinical outcome, and new therapeutic strategies for inhibiting the TCA cycle and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in cancer cells.

Certolizumab pegol attenuates the pro-inflammatory state in endothelial cells in a manner that is atheroprotective.
OBJECTIVES: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with accelerated atherosclerosis and premature cardiovascular death. Anti-TNF therapy is thought to reduce clinical cardiovascular disease risk and improve vascular function in RA patients. However, the specific effects of TNF inhibitors on endothelial cell function are largely unknown. Our aim was to explore the effects of certolizumab pegol (CZP) on TNF-activated human aortic endothelial cells (HAoECs). METHODS: HAoECs were cultured in vitro and exposed to i) TNF alone, ii) TNF plus CZP, or iii) neither agent. Microarray analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to analyse gene expression. Activation of NF-κB was investigated using immunocytochemistry, high content analysis and western blotting. Flow cytometry was performed to detect microparticle release from HAoECs. RESULTS: TNF alone had strong effects on endothelial gene expression, while TNF and CZP together produced a global gene expression pattern similar to untreated controls. In particular, genes for E-selectin, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 were significantly up-regulated by TNF treatment. Notably, the TNF/CZP cocktail prevented the up-regulation of these genes. TNF-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB was abolished by treatment with CZP. In addition the increased production of endothelial microparticles in TNF-activated HAoECs was prevented by treatment with CZP. CONCLUSIONS: We have found at cellular level, that a clinically available TNF inhibitor, CZP i) reduces adhesion molecule expression; ii) prevents TNF-induced activation of the NF-κB pathway and iii) prevents the production of microparticles by activated endothelial cells. This could be central to the prevention of inflammatory environments underlying these conditions.

The Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire: a reliable and valid patient-reported outcomes measure for linear scars.
BACKGROUND: There is a lack of rigorously validated patient-based outcomes measures of scarring. The aim of this study was to construct such a scale and demonstrate reliability and validity by applying the scale in a wide range of scarring samples. METHODS: The Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire with five subscales (i.e., Appearance, Symptoms, Consciousness, Satisfaction with Appearance, and Satisfaction with Symptoms) was constructed using multiple categorical response items. The Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire was applied to various surgical samples (total scar assessments n = 667) at months 3, 6, and 12 after surgery (and preoperatively in the scar revision group) and tested for internal consistency, test-retest reliability, convergent validity, known group differences, and sensitivity, against widely accepted criteria from psychometric measurement science. RESULTS: Subscales showed high internal consistency (Cronbach alpha, 0.73 to 0.93), except the Symptoms subscale. Test-retest reliability was high across all subscales (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.74 to 0.87) across all groups except the scar revision group. Change in Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire scores was significant between months 3 and 6 postoperatively (p < 0.001) and subscales demonstrated known group differences (p < 0.001). Convergent validity was demonstrated by significant moderate correlations with various measures of similar constructs (r = 0.26 to 0.61, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire is a reliable and valid measure of the patient's perception of scarring, although the Symptoms subscale requires further refinement. Subscales can be used independently of each other to allow assessment of scar change in specific domains.

[cell, autophagy, tumor, senescent, inhibitor, senescence, induction, cdk, fibroblast, growth]

CDK inhibitors (p16/p19/p21) induce senescence and autophagy in cancer-associated fibroblasts, "fueling" tumor growth via paracrine interactions, without an increase in neo-angiogenesis.
Here, we investigated the compartment-specific role of cell cycle arrest and senescence in breast cancer tumor growth. For this purpose, we generated a number of hTERT-immortalized senescent fibroblast cell lines overexpressing CDK inhibitors, such as p16(INK4A), p19(ARF) or p21(WAF1/CIP1). Interestingly, all these senescent fibroblast cell lines showed evidence of increased susceptibility toward the induction of autophagy (either at baseline or after starvation), as well as significant mitochondrial dysfunction. Most importantly, these senescent fibroblasts also dramatically promoted tumor growth (up to ~2-fold), without any comparable increases in tumor angiogenesis. Conversely, we generated human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 cells) overexpressing CDK inhibitors, namely p16(INK4A) or p21(WAF1/CIP1). Senescent MDA-MB-231 cells also showed increased expression of markers of cell cycle arrest and autophagy, including β-galactosidase, as predicted. Senescent MDA-MB-231 cells had retarded tumor growth, with up to a near 2-fold reduction in tumor volume. Thus, the effects of CDK inhibitors are compartment-specific and are related to their metabolic effects, which results in the induction of autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction. Finally, induction of cell cycle arrest with specific inhibitors (PD0332991) or cellular stressors hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) or starvation indicated that the onset of autophagy and senescence are inextricably linked biological processes. The compartment-specific induction of senescence (and hence autophagy) may be a new therapeutic target that could be exploited for the successful treatment of human breast cancer patients.

[inhibitor, vegf, biomarker, patient, datum, imaging, survival, tumor]

Do imaging biomarkers relate to outcome in patients treated with VEGF inhibitors?
The management of solid tumors has been transformed by the advent of VEGF pathway inhibitors. Early clinical evaluation of these drugs has used pharmacodynamic biomarkers derived from advanced imaging such as dynamic MRI, computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound to establish proof of principle. We have reviewed published studies that used these imaging techniques to determine whether the same biomarkers relate to survival in renal, hepatocellular, and brain tumors in patients treated with VEGF inhibitors. Data show that in renal cancer, pretreatment measurements of K(trans) and early pharmacodynamic reduction in tumor enhancement and density have prognostic significance in patients treated with VEGF inhibitors. A weaker, but significant, relationship is seen with subtle early size change (10% in one dimension) and survival. Data from high-grade glioma suggest that pretreatment fractional blood volume and K(trans) were prognostic of overall survival. However, lack of control data with other therapies prevents assessment of the predictive nature of these biomarkers, and such studies are urgently required.

Imaging biomarkers of angiogenesis and the microvascular environment in cerebral tumours.
Conventional contrast-enhanced CT and MRI are now in routine clinical use for the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of diseases in the brain. The presence of contrast enhancement is a proxy for the pathological changes that occur in the normally highly regulated brain vasculature and blood-brain barrier. With recognition of the limitations of these techniques, and a greater appreciation for the nuanced mechanisms of microvascular change in a variety of pathological processes, novel techniques are under investigation for their utility in further interrogating the microvasculature of the brain. This is particularly important in tumours, where the reliance on angiogenesis (new vessel formation) is crucial for tumour growth, and the resulting microvascular configuration and derangement has profound implications for diagnosis, treatment and monitoring. In addition, novel therapeutic approaches that seek to directly modify the microvasculature require more sensitive and specific biological markers of baseline tumour behaviour and response. The currently used imaging biomarkers of angiogenesis and brain tumour microvascular environment are reviewed.

Cochlear implantation in children with Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome - a cautionary tale.
OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Jervell and Lange-Nielsen (JLN) syndrome is a rare cause of congenital profound hearing loss associated with a prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram. Children presenting for cochlear implantation with this condition may be asymptomatic but are at risk of sudden death. SCREENING AND SUBSEQUENT: careful management is therefore required to ensure a successful outcome. We present our experience of cochlear implantation in children with JLN syndrome, including two who died unexpectedly, and suggest a protocol for management of such cases. Clinical presentation Four cases of cochlear implantation in JLN syndrome are described. None had any previous cardiological family history. Two were diagnosed pre-operatively but, despite appropriate management under a cardiologist, died from cardiac arrest; the first in the perioperative period following reimplantation for infection, and the second unrelated to his cochlear implant surgery. The other two patients were diagnosed only subsequent to their implantation and continue to use their implants successfully. CONCLUSION: These cases highlight the variation in presentation of JLN syndrome, and the spectrum of disease severity that exists. Our protocol stresses the importance of careful assessment and counselling of parents by an experienced implant team.

A pragmatic randomized controlled trial of thiopurine methyltransferase genotyping prior to azathioprine treatment: the TARGET study.
AIM: To conduct a pragmatic, randomized controlled trial to assess whether thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) genotyping prior to azathioprine reduces adverse drug reactions (ADRs). METHODS: A total of 333 participants were randomized 1:1 to undergo TPMT genotyping prior to azathioprine or to commence treatment without genotyping. RESULTS: There was no difference in the primary outcome of stopping azathioprine due to an adverse reaction (ADR, p = 0.59) between the two study arms. ADRs were more common in older patients (p = 0.01). There was no increase in stopping azathioprine due to ADRs in TPMT heterozygotes compared with wild-type individuals. The single individual with TPMT variant homozygosity experienced severe neutropenia. CONCLUSION: Our work supports the strong evidence that individuals with TPMT variant homozygosity are at high risk of severe neutropenia, whereas TPMT heterozygotes are not at increased risk of ADRs at standard doses of azathioprine.

[hyccin, hypomyelination, neuron, protein, postnatal, mouse, day, cataract, hcc, congenital]

Hyccin, the molecule mutated in the leukodystrophy hypomyelination and congenital cataract (HCC), is a neuronal protein.
"Hypomyelination and Congenital Cataract", HCC (MIM #610532), is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital cataract and diffuse cerebral and peripheral hypomyelination. HCC is caused by deficiency of Hyccin, a protein whose biological role has not been clarified yet. Since the identification of the cell types expressing a protein of unknown function can contribute to define the physiological context in which the molecule is explicating its function, we analyzed the pattern of Hyccin expression in the central and peripheral nervous system (CNS and PNS). Using heterozygous mice expressing the b-galactosidase (LacZ) gene under control of the Hyccin gene regulatory elements, we show that the gene is primarily expressed in neuronal cells. Indeed, Hyccin-LacZ signal was identified in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons, olfactory bulb, and cortical pyramidal neurons, while it did not colocalize with oligodendroglial or astrocytic markers. In the PNS, Hyccin was detectable only in axons isolated from newborn mice. In the brain, Hyccin transcript levels were higher in early postnatal development (postnatal days 2 and 10) and then declined in adult mice. In a model of active myelinogenesis, organotypic cultures of rat Schwann cells (SC)/Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons, Hyccin was detected along the neurites, while it was absent from SC. Intriguingly, the abundance of the molecule was upregulated at postnatal days 10 and 15, in the initial steps of myelinogenesis and then declined at 30 days when the process is complete. As Hyccin is primarily expressed in neurons and its mutation leads to hypomyelination in human patients, we suggest that the protein is involved in neuron-to-glia signalling to initiate or maintain myelination.

[patient, tissue, soft, trial, technique, mucosa, flap, implant, dental, flapless]

Interventions for replacing missing teeth: management of soft tissues for dental implants.
BACKGROUND: Dental implants are usually placed by elevating a soft tissue flap, but in some instances, they can also be placed flapless reducing patient discomfort. Several flap designs and suturing techniques have been proposed. Soft tissues are often manipulated and augmented for aesthetic reasons. It is often recommended that implants are surrounded by a sufficient width of attached/keratinised mucosa to improve their long-term prognosis. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether (1a) flapless procedures are beneficial for patients, and (1b) which is the ideal flap design; whether (2a) soft tissue correction/augmentation techniques are beneficial for patients, and (2b) which are the best techniques; whether (3a) techniques to increase the peri-implant keratinised mucosa are beneficial for patients, and (3b) which are the best techniques; and (4) which are the best suturing techniques/materials. SEARCH METHODS: The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 9 June 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 9 June 2011), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 9 June 2011). Several dental journals were handsearched. There were no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of root-form osseointegrated dental implants, with a follow-up of at least 6 months after function, comparing various techniques to handle soft tissues in relation to dental implants. Outcome measures, according to the different hypotheses, were: prosthetic and implant failures, biological complications, aesthetics evaluated by patients and dentists, postoperative pain, marginal peri-implant bone level changes on periapical radiographs, patient preference, ease of maintenance by patient, soft tissue thickness changes and attached/keratinised mucosa height changes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Screening of eligible studies, assessment of the methodological quality of the trials and data extraction were conducted at least in duplicate and independently by two or more review authors. Trial authors were contacted for missing information. Results were expressed using risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals. MAIN RESULTS: Seventeen potentially eligible RCTs were identified but only six trials with 138 patients in total could be included. One study was at low risk of bias, two studies were judged to be at unclear risk of bias and three at high risk of bias. Two trials (56 patients) compared flapless placement of dental implants with conventional flap elevation, one trial (10 patients) compared crestal versus vestibular incisions, one trial (20 patients) Erbium:YAG laser versus flap elevation at the second-stage surgery for implant exposure, one split-mouth trial (10 patients) evaluated whether connective tissue graft at implant placement could be effective in augmenting peri-implant tissues, and one trial (40 patients) compared autograft with an animal-derived collagen matrix to increase the height of the keratinised mucosa. On a patient, rather than per implant basis, implants placed with a flapless technique and implant exposures performed with laser induced statistically significantly less postoperative pain than flap elevation. Sites augmented with soft tissues connective grafts showed a better aesthetic and thicker tissues. Both palatal autografts or the use of a porcine-derived collagen matrix are effective in increasing the height of keratinised mucosa at the price of a 0.5 mm recession of peri-implant soft tissues. There were no other statistically significant differences for any of the remaining analyses. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is limited weak evidence suggesting that flapless implant placement is feasible and has been shown to reduce patient postoperative discomfort in adequately selected patients, that augmentation at implant sites with soft tissue grafts is effective in increasing soft tissue thickness improving aesthetics and that one technique to increase the height of keratinised mucosa using autografts or an animal-derived collagen matrix was able to achieve its goal but at the price of a worsened aesthetic outcome (0.5 mm of recession). There is insufficient reliable evidence to provide recommendations on which is the ideal flap design, the best soft tissue augmentation technique, whether techniques to increase the width of keratinised/attached mucosa are beneficial to patients or not, and which are the best incision/suture techniques/materials. Properly designed and conducted RCTs, with at least 6 months of follow-up, are needed to provide reliable answers to these questions.

The QUIJOTE-CMB experiment: studying the polarisation of the galactic and cosmological microwave emissions
The QUIJOTE (Q-U-I JOint Tenerife) CMB Experiment will operate at the Teide Observatory with the aim of characterizing the polarisation of the CMB and other processes of Galactic and extragalactic emission in the frequency range of 10-40GHz and at large and medium angular scales. The first of the two QUIJOTE telescopes and the first multi-frequency (10-30GHz) instrument are already built and have been tested in the laboratory. QUIJOTE-CMB will be a valuable complement at low frequencies for the Planck mission, and will have the required sensitivity to detect a primordial gravitational-wave component if the tensor-to-scalar ratio is larger than r = 0.05.

Opsonizing activity of C-reactive protein in phagocytosis of Aspergillus fumigatus conidia by human neutrophils.
In complement-free neutrophil monolayer assays pathological levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were found to promote greater phagocytosis of metabolically-active conidia of Aspergillus fumigatus than dormant spores. This suggests that metabolically-active conidia bind CRP which facilitates in vitro phagocytosis by human neutrophils.

Nonlinear H controllers for electromagnetic suspension systems
<p>This note presents a unified framework to derive nonlinear H-infinity state and output feedback controllers for magnetically levitated (Maglev) vehicles with controlled dc electromagnets, referred to as electromagnetic suspension systems. The theoretical exposition, based on the Taylor series expansion solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs inequality, is followed by an assessment of some of the practical issues in realizing the nonlinear controllers with a digital signal processor and embedded hardware. A select set of experimental results from a single-degree-of-freedom suspension system is included to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed nonlinear state- and output-feedback H-infinity controllers to suppress guideway-induced disturbances.</p>

[microscopy, dermatophyte, infection]

Diagnosis and pathogenesis of dermatophyte infections.
Dissemination of dermatophyte fungi depends on direct or indirect contact between infected and uninfected hosts. The first step in the infection process is colonisation of the cornified surface of the stratum corneum. The fungal form which is the contagious and infectious particle is most likely to be the arthrospore or a hyphal fragment adhering to or contained within a corneocyte. It is the distinctive morphological forms of hyphae and arthrospores, and the relatively large size of dermatophytes in keratinous tissue, that provide the basis of a rapid diagnostic method using microscopy. Microscopy may also have to provide the definitive diagnosis of a dermatophyte infection, eg, in onychomycosis, where a significant proportion of the samples which are positive on microscopy fail to grow in culture. The sensitivity of microscopy can be enhanced using KOH that incorporates a variety of dyes, or a fluorescent brightener (eg, Calcofluor white or Blankophor BA). This type of agent can also be used to recognise fungal elements in biopsy sections. However, culture has certain benefits over microscopy; it is a more sensitive technique, since much more material can be examined and a definitive identity of the organism can be obtained.

HPC LES & quasi-DNS of Complex Geometries Applied to Power Generation
Fluid-elastic instabilities, fatigue and wear inside steam generator tubes are a major concern for power generation industry. A major parametric CFD study of tube bundles seems worthwhile in view of the large potential savings worldwide, for coal power plants alone; Bouris et al. 2001. As experimental studies are limited in terms of level of detail and access inside densely packed arrays, predictions from fine numerical simulations (such as LES,  DNS/quasi-DNS) are a useful complement. A highly complex flow pattern exists for such multiple tube configurations (in-line or staggered bundles) with peculiar flow behaviors such as asymmetry in pressure distributions and/or wake deflections. Thus, one should  first focus on simpler configurations such as the flow over single or  a few (tandem or side-by-side) cylinders in order to not only validate the approach, but also to understand the underlying flow physics better. Within the framework of power generation, the nuclear power generators have many different design configurations and variants which include highly complex channels and sub channels, offering axial-, cross- or mixed axial-cross-flow configurations. In the current discourse we present results from both the cross and axial flow configurations

The non-synonymous SNP, R1150W, in SCN9A is not associated with chronic widespread pain susceptibility.
ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Mutations in SCN9A, encoding the alpha subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav1.7), have caused severe pain disorders and congenital insensitivity to pain. The aim of this study was to validate the previously reported association between a common non-synonymous polymorphism (R1150W, rs6746030) in SCN9A and chronic widespread pain (CWP), in independent population-based cohorts. FINDINGS: Genotype data for rs6746030 was available in four population-based cohorts (EPIFUND, the European Male Ageing Study (EMAS), the Framingham study and the Dyne Steel DNA Bank of Ageing and Cognition). Pain was assessed using body manikins and CWP was scored using American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria in all cohorts, except the Framingham study which assessed widespread pain (WP) using ACR criteria on a joint pain homunculus. Controls were subjects who reported no pain. Logistic regression (additive genetic model) was used to test for association between rs6746030 and CWP compared to controls, adjusting for study centre in EMAS. Generalised estimating equation regression was used to test for association between rs6746030 and WP, whilst accounting for relatedness between subjects in the Framingham study.Genotype data for rs6746030 was available for 1071 CWP cases and 3212 controls. There was no significant association between CWP and rs6476030 in individual cohorts or when combined in a fixed-effects meta-analysis (Odds Ratio = 0.96 (95% confidence interval 0.82, 1.11) p = 0.567). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to a previous study, no association between a non-synonymous polymorphism in SCN9A and CWP was observed in multiple population-based cohorts.

Explaining Financial Scandals: Corporate Governance, Structured Finance and the Enlightened Sovereign Control Paradigm
Submitted by Vincenzo Bavoso for the degree of PhD entitled “Explaining financial scandals: corporate governance, structured finance and the enlightened sovereign control paradigm”, School of Law, Faculty of Humanities, The University of Manchester, 30/06/2012.The explosion of the global financial crisis in 2007-08 reignited the urgency to reflect on the origins and causes of financial collapses. As the above events kick-started an economic meltdown that is still ongoing, comparisons with the Great Crash of 1929 started to abound. In particular, the externalities that a broad spectrum of societal groups had to bear as a consequence of various banking failures highlighted the necessity of a more inclusive and balanced regulation of firms whose activities impact on a wide range of stakeholders.The thesis is centred on the proposal of a paradigm, the “enlightened sovereign control”, that provides a theoretical, institutional and substantive framework as a response to the legal issues analysed in the thesis. These stem primarily from the analysis of two sequences of events (the 2001-03 wave of “accounting frauds” and the 2007-08 global crisis) which represent the background upon which modern financial scandals are explained. This is done by highlighting a number of common denominators emerging from the case studies (Enron and Parmalat, Northern Rock and Lehman Brothers) which caused financial instability and scandals. The research is grounded on the initial recognition of theoretical themes in the field of corporate and financial law, which eventually link with the more practical events examined. This parallel enquiry leads to the investigation of two heavily interrelated spheres of law and finally highlights more practical legal issues that emerge from the analysis.Through this multifaceted approach, the thesis contends that the occurrence of financial crises during the last decade is essentially rooted in two main problems: a corporate governance one, represented by the lack of effective control systems within large public firms; and a corporate finance one identified with the excesses of financial innovation and related abuses of capital market finance. Research conducted in this thesis ultimately seeks to contribute to current debates in the areas of corporate and financial law, through the proposals of the “enlightened sovereign control” paradigm.

Circulating tumor cells as a window on metastasis biology in lung cancer.
Circulating tumor cell (CTC) number in metastatic cancer patients yields prognostic information consistent with enhanced cell migration and invasion via loss of adhesion, a feature of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Tumor cells also invade via collective migration with maintained cell-cell contacts and consistent with this is the circulating tumor microemboli (CTM; contiguous groups of tumor cells) that are observed in metastatic cancer patients. Using a blood filtration approach, we examined markers of EMT (cytokeratins, E-cadherin, vimentin, neural cadherin) and prevalence of apoptosis in CTCs and CTM to explore likely mechanism(s) of invasion in lung cancer patients and address the hypothesis that cells within CTM have a survival advantage. Intra-patient and inter-patient heterogeneity was observed for EMT markers in CTCs and CTM. Vimentin was only expressed in some CTCs, but in the majority of cells within CTM; E-cadherin expression was lost, cytoplasmic or nuclear, and rarely expressed at the surface of the cells within CTM. A subpopulation of CTCs was apoptotic, but apoptosis was absent within CTM. This pilot study suggests that EMT is not prosecuted homogeneously in tumor cells within the circulation of lung cancer patients and that collective migration and enhanced survival of cells within CTM might contribute to lung cancer metastasis. Multiplex analysis and further detailed exploration of metastatic potential and EMT in CTCs/CTM is now warranted in a larger patient cohort.

The critical role of IL-15 in the antitumor effects mediated by the combination therapy imatinib and IL-2.
The synergistic antitumor effects of the combination therapy imatinib mesylate (IM) and IL-2 depended upon NK1.1- expressing cells and were associated with the accumulation of CD11c(int)B220(+)NK1.1(+) IFN-producing killer dendritic cells (IKDC) into tumor beds. In this study, we show that the antitumor efficacy of the combination therapy was compromised in IL-15 and IFN-type 1R loss-of-function mice. IL-15Ralpha was required for the proliferation of IKDC during IM plus IL-2 therapy. Trans-presentation of IL-15/IL-15Ralpha activated IKDC to express CCR2 and to respond to type 1 IFN by producing CCL2. Moreover, the antitumor effects of the combination therapy correlated with a CCL2-dependent recruitment of IKDC, but not B220(-) NK cells, into tumor beds. Altogether, the IL-15-driven peripheral expansion and the CCL-2-dependent intratumoral chemoattraction of IKDC are two critical parameters dictating the antitumor efficacy of IM plus IL-2 in mice.

Enhancing the value of nitrogen from rapeseed meal for microbial oil production
Rapeseed meal, a major byproduct of biodiesel production, has been used as a low-cost raw material for the production of a generic microbial feedstock through a consolidated bioconversion process. Various strategies were tested for the production of a novel fermentation medium, rich in free amino nitrogen (FAN): commercial enzymes (CEs) (2.7 mg g(-1) dry meal), liquid state fungal pre-treatment (LSF) using Aspergillus oryzae (4.6 mg g(-1)), liquid state fungal pre-treatment followed by fungal autolysis (LSFA) (9.13 mg g(-1)), liquid state pre-treatment using fungal enzymatic broth (EB) (2.1 mg g(-1)), but the best strategy was a solid state fungal pre-treatment followed by fungal autolysis (34.5 mg g(-1)). The bioavailability of the nitrogen sources in the novel medium was confirmed in fed-batch bioreactor studies, in which 82.3 g dry cell L-1 of the oleaginous yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides Y4 was obtained with a lipid content of 48\%. The dry cell weight obtained was higher than that obtained using conventional yeast extract, due to a higher total nitrogen content in the novel biomedium. The fatty acids obtained from the microbial oil were similar to those derived from rapeseed oil. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Polyandry reduces sperm length variation in social insects.
Postcopulatory sexual selection, either in the form of sperm competition or cryptic female choice, is an important selective force that is thought to have generated the enormous variation in sperm morphology observed interspecifically. However, the evolutionary significance of intraspecific variation in sperm morphology, and the role that postcopulatory sexual selection plays in influencing this variation, remains poorly investigated in invertebrates. Here, we tested the hypothesis that postcopulatory sexual selection reduces variation in sperm morphology, both between and within males, in 27 species of eusocial ants and bees. These eusocial species offer an unusual opportunity to assess how selection acts on variance in sperm morphology, as haploid males produce clonal, haploid sperm that does not experience haploid–diploid conflict. We provide solid evidence that males of polyandrous ant and bee species indeed produce less–variable sperm, indicating that sperm competition selected for sperm of superior quality. Our results offer a mechanistic explanation for the evolution of high–quality sperm and provide comprehensive evidence that sperm morphology of social insects is influenced by sexual selection.

A role for an Hsp70 nucleotide exchange factor in the regulation of synaptic vesicle endocytosis
Neurotransmission requires a continuously available pool of synaptic vesicles (SVs) that can fuse with the plasma membrane and release their neurotransmitter contents upon stimulation. After fusion, SV membranes and membrane proteins are retrieved from the presynaptic plasma membrane by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. After the internalization of a clathrin-coated vesicle, the vesicle must uncoat to replenish the pool of SVs. Clathrin-coated vesicle uncoating requires ATP and is mediated by the ubiquitous molecular chaperone Hsc70. In vitro, depolymerized clathrin forms a stable complex with Hsc70*ADP. This complex can be dissociated by nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) that release ADP from Hsc70, allowing ATP to bind and induce disruption of the clathrin:Hsc70 association. Whether NEFs generally play similar roles in vesicle trafficking in vivo and whether they play such roles in SV endocytosis in particular is unknown. To address this question, we used information from recent structural and mechanistic studies of Hsp70:NEF and Hsp70:co-chaperone interactions to design a NEF inhibitor. Using acute perturbations at giant reticulospinal synapses of the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), we found that this NEF inhibitor inhibited SV endocytosis. When this inhibitor was mutated so that it could no longer bind and inhibit Hsp110 (a NEF that we find to be highly abundant in brain cytosol), its ability to inhibit SV endocytosis was eliminated. These observations indicate that the action of a NEF, most likely Hsp110, is normally required during SV trafficking to release clathrin from Hsc70 and make it available for additional rounds of endocytosis.© The Author(s),  2013.

The relative health related quality of life of veterans with Parkinson's disease
<p><b>Objectives: </b>To use databases of the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to describe the impact of Parkinson's disease on health related quality of life (HRQoL) of veterans; to compare the HRQoL of veterans with Parkinson's disease with that of veterans reporting eight other neurological or chronic conditions; and to estimate the unique effect of Parkinson's disease on HRQoL.

</p>
<p><b>Methods:</b> Respondents to the VHA 1999 large national health survey of veteran enrollees with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease in VHA treatment files for the fiscal years 1997–1999 were identified by merging databases. The survey incorporated the Veterans SF-36, a well validated generic measure of HRQoL and functional status. This was used to compare patient groups. Mean physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) component summary scores were calculated for Parkinson's disease and eight other diseases by multivariable regressions that adjusted for age, sex, race, education, and 15 mental and physical co-morbid conditions that were self reported in the survey.

</p>
<p><b>Results:</b> Of 887 775 survey respondents, 14 530 (1.64%) had a Parkinson's disease diagnosis. Controlling for sociodemographic factors and co-morbidities, veterans with Parkinson's disease had PCS and MCS below veterans with angina/coronary heart disease, arthritis, chronic low back pain, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and stroke. Veterans with spinal cord injury reported slightly lower PCS than veterans with Parkinson's disease (32.38 v 32.72; 0.03 of 1 SD). Veterans with depression reported markedly lower MCS than veterans with Parkinson's disease (35.94 v 41.48; 0.55 of 1 SD). The unique effect of having Parkinson's disease on HRQoL was to lower PCS and MCS by 4.10 and 3.42 points (0.41 and 0.34 of 1 SD), respectively.

</p>
<p><b>Conclusions:</b> The analysis quantifies the negative impact of Parkinson's disease on HRQoL, after controlling for sociodemographic factors and co-morbidities. Compared with eight other chronic conditions, Parkinson's disease imposes a relatively heavy burden on US veterans in the VHA health care system.</p>

Response of C(60) and C(n) to ultrashort laser pulses
In this paper we introduce a method for realistic simulations of nonadiabatic processes, including the interaction of light with matter. Calculations of the response Of C(60) and carbon chains to laser pulses demonstrate that even rather subtle features are correctly described. For example, in C(60) the pentagonal-pinch models dominant at low fluence, the breathing mode is dominant at high fluence, and dimers are preferentially emitted during photofragmentation. In carbon chains, on the other hand, trimers tend to be broken off. After collisional fragmentation, the remnants of a C(60) molecule tend to reform their bonds, yielding new 5, 6, or 7 membered rings.

Allergic contact dermatitis: a commentary on the relationship between T lymphocytes and skin sensitising potency.
T lymphocytes mediate skin sensitisation and allergic contact dermatitis. Not unexpectedly, therefore, there is considerable interest in the use of T lymphocyte-based assays as alternative strategies for the identification of skin sensitising chemicals. However, in addition to accurate identification of hazards the development of effective risk assessments requires that information is available about the relative skin sensitising potency of contact allergens. The purpose of this article is to consider the relationships that exist between the characteristics of T lymphocyte responses to contact allergens and the effectiveness/potency of sensitisation. We propose that there are 3 aspects of T lymphocyte responses that have the potential to impact on the potency of sensitisation. These are: (a) the magnitude of response, and in particular the vigour and duration of proliferation and the clonal expansion of allergen-reactive T lymphocytes, (b) the quality of response, including the balance achieved between effector and regulatory cells, and (c) the breadth of response and the clonal diversity of T lymphocyte responses. A case is made that there may be opportunities to exploit an understanding of T lymphocyte responses to contact allergens to develop novel paradigms for predicting skin sensitising potency and new approaches to risk assessment.

By examining their magnetic state, Cr cations are shown to exist in trivalent form on octahedral sites within the magnetite spinel surface. The possibility of reducing toxic Cr(VI) into a stable, nontoxic form, such as a Cr3+-spinel layer, makes biogenic magnetite nanoparticles an attractive candidate for Cr remediation.

A systematic investigation of confirmed autoimmune loci in early-onset psoriasis reveals an association with IL2/IL21.
BACKGROUND: Many autoimmune diseases share common susceptibility loci suggesting similar underlying cellular mechanisms involved in disease expression. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this investigation was to study 21 genetic variants in 14 genes that are confirmed autoimmune loci in a cohort of patients with early-onset psoriasis. METHODS: Patients with early-onset psoriasis (n = 750) and controls (n = 3531) were genotyped using the Sequenom(®) MassArray™ iPLEX Gold platform. RESULTS: We found strong evidence of association with two variants in the IL2/IL21 (rs6822844, genotypic P = 3·3 × 10(-4) ; rs2069778, genotypic P = 7·86 × 10(-4)) region. CONCLUSIONS: The findings, although requiring replication, suggest that IL2/IL21 may play a key role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis as well as in other diverse autoimmune diseases.

[human, trh, melanocyte, hf, pigmentation, transcription, hair, pituitary, hormone]

Thyrotropin-releasing hormone selectively stimulates human hair follicle pigmentation.
In amphibians, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulates skin melanophores by inducing secretion of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone in the pituitary gland. However, it is unknown whether this tripeptide neurohormone exerts any direct effects on pigment cells, namely, on human melanocytes, under physiological conditions. Therefore, we have investigated whether TRH stimulates pigment production in organ-cultured human hair follicles (HFs), the epithelium of which expresses both TRH and its receptor, and/or in full-thickness human skin in situ. TRH stimulated melanin synthesis, tyrosinase transcription and activity, melanosome formation, melanocyte dendricity, gp100 immunoreactivity, and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor expression in human HFs in a pituitary gland-independent manner. TRH also stimulated proliferation, gp100 expression, tyrosinase activity, and dendricity of isolated human HF melanocytes. However, intraepidermal melanogenesis was unaffected. As TRH upregulated the intrafollicular production of "pituitary" neurohormones (proopiomelanocortin transcription and ACTH immunoreactivity) and as agouti-signaling protein counteracted TRH-induced HF pigmentation, these pigmentary TRH effects may be mediated in part by locally generated melanocortins and/or by MC-1 signaling. Our study introduces TRH as a novel, potent, selective, and evolutionarily highly conserved neuroendocrine factor controlling human pigmentation in situ. This physiologically relevant and melanocyte sub-population-specific neuroendocrine control of human pigmentation deserves clinical exploration, e.g., for preventing or reversing hair graying.

The future of industrial antibiotic production: From random mutagenesis to synthetic biology
atural products derived from the secondary metabolism of microbes constitute a cornerstone of modern medicine. Engineering bugs to produce these products in high quantities is a major challenge for biotechnology, which has usually been tackled by either one of two strategies: iterative random mutagenesis or rational design. Recently, we analyzed the transcriptome of a Streptomyces clavuligerus strain optimized for production of the ??-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid by multiple rounds of mutagenesis and selection, and discovered that the observed changes matched surprisingly well with simple changes that have been introduced into these strains by rational engineering. Here, we discuss how in the new field of synthetic biology, random mutagenesis and rational engineering can be implemented complementarily in ways which may enable one to go beyond the status quo that has now been reached by each method independently. ?? 2011 Landes Bioscience.

Fossils explained 58 - Trigonotarbids
The Earth???s oldest terrestrial ecosystems date from the Late Silurian period, about 414 million years ago. Amongst primitive plants lived the first land-based animals; invertebrate invaders of a new world, some 30 million years before vertebrates made the very same transition. The fossil record suggests many early land animals were arthropods, belonging to subgroups such as Myriapoda (e.g. millipedes and centipedes) and Arachnida (e.g. spiders, scorpions, mites, etc.). Trigonotarbids belong to the latter. They are appar- ently primitive arachnids, superficially similar in ap- pearance to spiders, but lacking the ability to produce silk. Their presence at Ludford Lane in the Welsh Borderlands in the UK (P??\'{\i}dol\'{\i}, Late Silurian) places the group amongst the earliest terrestrial animals, and their anatomy is well known from exception- ally preserved, silicified fossils in the slightly younger Early Devonian Rhynie Chert of Scotland (Fig. 1). By the Late Carboniferous, trigonotarbids seem to have been amongst the most abundant arachnids; at least their fossils are relatively common throughout the Coal Measures deposits of Europe and North America. They have also been recorded in South America. Such success didn???t last???the group became extinct in the Permian.

Adalimumab in acute sciatica reduces the long-term need for surgery: a 3-year follow-up of a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial.
INTRODUCTION: Two subcutaneous injections of adalimumab in severe acute sciatica significantly reduced the number of back operations in a short-term randomised controlled clinical trial. OBJECTIVE: To determine in a 3-year follow-up study whether the short-term benefit of adalimumab in sciatica is sustained over a longer period of time. METHODS: The primary outcome of this analysis was incident discectomy. Three years after randomisation, information on surgery could be retrieved in 56/61 patients (92%).A multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, adjusted for potential confounders, was used to determine factors predisposing to surgery. RESULTS: Twenty-three (41%) patients had back surgery within 3 years, 8/29 (28%) in the adalimumab group and 15/27 (56%) in the placebo group, p=0.04. Adalimumab injections reduced the need for back surgery by 61% (HR)=0.39 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.92). In a multivariate model, treatment with a tumour necrosis factor-α antagonist remained the strongest protective factor (HR=0.17, p=0.002). Other significant predictors of surgery were a good correlation between symptoms and MRI findings (HR=11.6, p=0.04), baseline intensity of leg pain (HR=1.3, p=0.06), intensity of back pain (HR=1.4, p=0.03) and duration of sickness leave (HR=1.01 per day, p=0.03). CONCLUSION: A short course of adalimumab in patients with severe acute sciatica significantly reduces the need for back surgery.

[response, eosinophilic, infection]

TGF-beta prevents eosinophilic lung disease but impairs pathogen clearance.
Respiratory infections are the third leading cause of death worldwide. Complications arise directly as a consequence of pathogen replication or indirectly due to aberrant or excessive immune responses. In the following report, we evaluate the efficacy, in a murine model, of nasally delivered DNA encoding TGF-beta1 to suppress immunopathology in response to a variety of infectious agents. A single nasal administration suppressed lymphocyte responses to Cryptococcus neoformans, influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus. The suppression did not depend on the phenotype of the responding T cell, since both Th1 and Th2 responses were affected. During Th2-inducing infection, pulmonary eosinophilic responses were significantly suppressed. In all cases, however, suppressed immunity correlated with increased susceptibility to infection. We conclude that nasal TGF-beta treatment could be used to prevent pulmonary, pathogen-driven eosinophilic disease, although anti-pathogen strategies will need to be administered concordantly.

[oligomer, assembly, toxic, state, nm, intermediate, conformational, amyloid, antibody, evolution]

Conserved features of intermediates in amyloid assembly determine their benign or toxic states
Some amyloid-forming polypeptides are associated with devastating human diseases and others provide important biological functions. For both, oligomeric intermediates appear during amyloid assembly. Currently we have few tools for characterizing these conformationally labile intermediates and discerning what governs their benign versus toxic states. Here, we examine intermediates in the assembly of a normal, functional amyloid, the prion-determining region of yeast Sup35 (NM). During assembly, NM formed a variety of oligomers with different sizes and conformation-specific antibody reactivities. Earlier oligomers were less compact and reacted with the conformational antibody A11. More mature oligomers were more compact and reacted with conformational antibody OC. We found we could arrest NM in either of these two distinct oligomeric states with small molecules or crosslinking. The A11-reactive oligomers were more hydrophobic (as measured by Nile Red binding) and were highly toxic to neuronal cells, while OC-reactive oligomers were less hydrophobic and were not toxic. The A11 and OC antibodies were originally raised against oligomers of Aβ, an amyloidogenic peptide implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that is completely unrelated to NM in sequence. Thus, this natural yeast prion samples two conformational states similar to those sampled by Aβ, and when assembly stalls at one of these two states, but not the other, it becomes extremely toxic. Our results have implications for selective pressures operating on the evolution of amyloid folds across a billion years of evolution. Understanding the features that govern such conformational transitions will shed light on human disease and evolution alike.

[cancer, aging, tumor, cell, stroma, inflammation, metabolism, autophagy]

Accelerated aging in the tumor microenvironment: connecting aging, inflammation and cancer metabolism with personalized medicine.
Cancer is thought to be a disease associated with aging. Interestingly, normal aging is driven by the production of ROS and mitochondrial oxidative stress, resulting in the cumulative accumulation of DNA damage. Here, we discuss how ROS signaling, NFκB- and HIF1-activation in the tumor microenvironment induces a form of "accelerated aging," which leads to stromal inflammation and changes in cancer cell metabolism. Thus, we present a unified model where aging (ROS), inflammation (NFκB) and cancer metabolism (HIF1), act as co-conspirators to drive autophagy ("self-eating") in the tumor stroma. Then, autophagy in the tumor stroma provides high-energy "fuel" and the necessary chemical building blocks, for accelerated tumor growth and metastasis. Stromal ROS production acts as a "mutagenic motor" and allows cancer cells to buffer-at a distance-exactly how much of a mutagenic stimulus they receive, further driving tumor cell selection and evolution. Surviving cancer cells would be selected for the ability to induce ROS more effectively in stromal fibroblasts, so they could extract more nutrients from the stroma via autophagy. If lethal cancer is a disease of "accelerated host aging" in the tumor stroma, then cancer patients may benefit from therapy with powerful antioxidants. Antioxidant therapy should block the resulting DNA damage, and halt autophagy in the tumor stroma, effectively "cutting off the fuel supply" for cancer cells. These findings have important new implications for personalized cancer medicine, as they link aging, inflammation and cancer metabolism with novel strategies for more effective cancer diagnostics and therapeutics.

Post-treatment outcomes of buprenorphine detoxification in community settings: a systematic review.
A systematic review was undertaken to examine studies of buprenorphine detoxification that has included post-treatment outcomes as well as more immediate aspects of progress. Studies were required to report details of buprenorphine withdrawal regime and post-treatment outcomes including abstinence rates. Only five studies met these criteria, with buprenorphine regimes lasting 3 days to several weeks, and with variable follow-up. Detoxification completion rates were 65-100%, but relatively few treatment completers were then drug free at their follow-up appointments. In subsequent prescribing, more patients had returned to opioid maintenance than complied with naltrexone. Our preliminary review indicates that buprenorphine is a suitable medication for the process of opiate detoxification but that this newer treatment option has not led to higher rates of abstinence following withdrawal. Further studies are required to more substantially examine abstinence outcomes, as well as characteristics which predict success.

Two- and One-Dimensional Light Propagations and Gain in Layer-by-Layer-Deposited Colloidal Nanocrystal Waveguides
<p>Optical waveguides containing high percentages of colloidal nanocrystals have been fabricated by layer-by-layer deposition on planar and patterned glass substrates. The two- and one-dimensional waveguidings in these structures are demonstrated by propagation loss experiments. The experimental results obtained for various film thicknesses and widths of the waveguide stripes together with simulations of the light propagation indicate that the losses are dominated by surface roughness. The variable stripe length method is used to determine the optical gain of 230 cm(-1) from the amplified spontaneous emission. This high value makes the authors' waveguide structures very promising for applications in amplifiers and lasers with reduced threshold powers.</p>

Cleavage modelling with experimental particle size distribution and novel particle failure criterion
Most of the existing local approaches for cleavage fracture derive from the assumptions that global failure is a weakest-link event and that only the tail of the size distribution of micro-crack initiating features is significant. This appears to be sufficient in predicting lower shelf toughness under high constraint conditions, but may fail when attempting to predict toughness in the transition region or for low constraint conditions when using the same parameters. While coupled ductile damage models with Beremin-like failure probability could be useful in the transition region, uncoupled models with “a posteriori” probability calculations are advantageous to the engineering community. Cleavage toughness predictions in the transition regime, which can be extended to low constraint conditions, are here made with improved criterion for particle failure and experimentally based size distribution of initiators for specific RPV steel. The model is shown to predict experimentally measured locations of cleavage initiators. Further, the model predicts the fracture toughness in a large part of the transition region and accurately predicts a measured shift with irradiation. All results are obtained without changes in model parameters. This suggests that the model can be used for assessing toughness changes due to constraint- and temperature-driven plasticity changes.

A Hybrid Quadrupole Design for the RAL Front End Test Stand (FETS)
The Front End Test Stand project being constructed at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) aims to deliver a high current (60 mA) H- chopped ion beam, at 3 MeV and 50 pps. The main components of FETS are the H- ion source, the Low Energy Beam Transport line (LEBT), the Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ), the Medium Energy Transport (MEBT) line with beam chopper, as well as a comprehensive set of diagnostics. Space restrictions in the MEBT line place constraints on component length and drive the requirement to identify compact component configurations. A description is given of a novel compact hybrid quadrupole magnet, whose design is based on the concentric combination of a permanent magnet quadrupole (PMQ) and a laminar conductor electromagnetic quadrupole (EMQ). Simulations of magnetic field distribution 3D are presented, and possible applications and further developments are discussed.

Use of G-CSF during concurrent chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy in patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer safety data from a phase II trial.
There is paucity of data in the literature regarding the safety of combining granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) during chemo-radiotherapy (CTRT) in lung cancer patients. The ASCO 2006 recommendations advise against use of CSFs during concomitant mediastinal CTRT. The only randomised study evaluating CSFs in this context showed significant increase in grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia and an excess of pulmonary toxic deaths. In the context of a phase II trial, 38 patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer were randomised to receive once-daily (66 Gy in 33 fractions) or twice-daily (45 Gy in 30 fractions) radiotherapy. Radiotherapy (RT) was given concurrently with cisplatin and etoposide. G-CSF was given as primary or secondary prophylaxis or as a therapeutic measure during an episode of febrile neutropenia according to local protocols. Common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) v3.0 was used to record toxicity. Thirteen (34%) of 38 patients received G-CSF concurrently with RT. With a median follow-up of 16.9 months, there were no treatment related deaths reported. Seven (54%) patients experienced grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia and 5 (38%) experienced grade 3/4 anaemia. Thirty-one percent required platelet transfusions. No episodes of bleeding were observed. There were no cases of grade 3/4 acute pneumonitis. These data suggests that with modern three-dimensional (3D) conformal RT, G-CSF administration concurrently with CTRT does not result in the increase risk of pulmonary toxicity, but does increase the risk of thrombocytopenia. Whether the risks of thrombocytopenia are outweighed by the outcome of timely early concurrent CTRT is being evaluated prospectively in the ongoing phase III CONVERT trial (NCT00433563) in which G-CSF is permitted during thoracic irradiation.

Biomarkers for small cell lung cancer: neuroendocrine, epithelial and circulating tumour cells.
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterised by an aggressive clinical course with invariable resistance to chemotherapy despite initially high response rates. There has been little improvement in outcome over the past few decades, with no breakthrough yet in targeted therapies. Recent preclinical data and studies of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) highlight distinct cellular heterogeneity within SCLC. Better understanding of how these phenotypes contribute to metastasis and tumour progression might pave the way for development of more successful targeted therapies. Here we review these studies, their implications for future research and for the incorporation of biomarkers reflecting neuroendocrine, epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes in clinical studies.

Increased amygdala responses to sad but not fearful faces in major depression: relation to mood state and pharmacological treatment.
OBJECTIVE: Increased amygdala response to negative emotions seen in functional MRI (fMRI) has been proposed as a biomarker for negative emotion processing bias underlying depressive symptoms and vulnerability to depressive relapse that are normalized by antidepressant drug treatment. The purpose of this study was to determine whether abnormal amygdala responses to face emotions in depression are related to specific emotions or change in response to antidepressant treatment and whether they are present as a stable trait in medication-free patients in remission. METHOD: Sixty-two medication-free unipolar depressed patients (38 were currently depressed, and 24 were in remission) and 54 healthy comparison subjects underwent an indirect face-emotion processing task during fMRI. Thirty-two currently depressed patients were treated with the antidepressant citalopram for 8 weeks. Adherence to treatment was evaluated by measuring citalopram plasma concentrations. RESULTS: Patients with current depression had increased bilateral amygdala responses specific to sad faces relative to healthy comparison subjects and nonmedicated patients in stable remission. Treatment with citalopram abolished the abnormal amygdala responses to sad faces in currently depressed patients but did not alter responses to fearful faces. CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant amygdala activation in response to sad facial emotions is specific to the depressed state and is a potential biomarker for a negative affective bias during a depressive episode.

Structure and Collective Excitations of He-4 Clusters
We compute zero-temperature ground-state energies, one- and two-body densities, collective-excitation spectra, transition densities, and static and dynamic structure functions of He-4 clusters up to a cluster size of N = 112 particles. The ground-state properties are computed using a second-order diffusion Monte Carlo algorithm with Jastrow and triplet trial functions used for importance sampling. Excitation energies, transition densities, and dynamic structure functions are obtained by solving a generalized Feynman eigenvalue equation. We determine the systematic variation of collective energies with cluster size, demonstrate the existence of persistent oscillations in transition densities, evaluate the strength of collective modes quantitatively, and show how the cluster continuum excitation spectrum can be directly mapped by the dynamic structure function. By comparison with the full static structure function, the collective quadrupole state is found to exhaust approximately 25% of the total strength.

[nucleation, rate, barrier, random, non-self-averaging]

A statistical theory of nucleation in the presence of uncharacterised impurities
<p>First order phase transitions proceed via nucleation. The rate of nucleation varies exponentially with the free-energy barrier to nucleation, and so is highly sensitive to variations in this barrier. In practice, very few systems are absolutely pure, there are typically some impurities present which are rather poorly characterized. These interact with the nucleus, causing the barrier to vary, and so must be taken into account. Here the impurity-nucleus interactions are modelled by random variables. The rate then has the same form as the partition function of Derrida's random energy model, and as in this model there is a regime in which the behavior is non-self-averaging. Non-self-averaging nucleation is nucleation with a rate that varies significantly from one realization of the random variables to another. In experiment this corresponds to variation in the nucleation rate from one sample to another. General analytic expressions are obtained for the crossover from a self-averaging to a non-self-averaging rate of nucleation.</p>

The most common type of FTLD-FUS (aFTLD-U) is associated with a distinct clinical form of frontotemporal dementia but is not related to mutations in the FUS gene.
Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is clinically, pathologically and genetically heterogeneous. Recent descriptions of a pathological sub-type that is ubiquitin positive, TDP-43 negative and immunostains positive for the Fused in Sarcoma protein (FUS) raises the question whether it is associated with a distinct clinical phenotype identifiable on clinical grounds, and whether mutations in the Fused in Sarcoma gene (FUS) might also be associated with FTLD. Examination of a pathological series of 118 cases of FTLD from two centres, showing tau-negative, ubiquitin-positive pathology, revealed FUS pathology in five patients, four classified as atypical FTLD with ubiquitin inclusions (aFTLD-U), and one as neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease (NIFID). The aFTLD-U cases had youthful onset (22-46 years), an absence of strong family history, a behavioural syndrome consistent with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and severe caudate atrophy. Their cognitive/behavioural profile was distinct, characterised by prominent obsessionality, repetitive behaviours and rituals, social withdrawal and lack of engagement, hyperorality with pica, and marked stimulus-bound behaviour including utilisation behaviour. They conformed to the rare behavioural sub-type of FTD identified previously by us as the "stereotypic" form, and linked to striatal pathology. Cognitive evaluation revealed executive deficits in keeping with subcortical-frontal dysfunction, but no cortical deficits in language, perceptuospatial skills or praxis. The patient with NIFID was older and exhibited aphasia and dyspraxia. No patient had clinical evidence of motor neurone disease during life, or a mutation in the FUS gene. In the complementary clinical study of 312 patients with clinical syndromes of FTLD, genetic analysis revealed a 6 bp deletion in FUS in 3 patients, of questionable significance. One presented a prototypical picture of FTD, another expressive language disorder, and the third semantic dementia. None showed the early onset age or distinctive 'stereotypic' picture of patients with aFTLD-U. We conclude that aFTLD-U is associated with a distinct clinical form of frontotemporal dementia, potentially allowing identification of such patients in life with a high degree of precision. Whether mutations in the FUS gene cause some cases of FTLD remains unresolved.

Extensive Management Promotes Plant and Microbial Nitrogen Retention in Temperate Grassland
<p>Leaching losses of nitrogen (N) from soil and atmospheric N deposition have led to widespread changes in plant community and microbial community composition, but our knowledge of the factors that determine ecosystem N retention is limited. A common feature of extensively managed, species-rich grasslands is that they have fungal-dominated microbial communities, which might reduce soil N losses and increase ecosystem N retention, which is pivotal for pollution mitigation and sustainable food production. However, the mechanisms that underpin improved N retention in extensively managed, species-rich grasslands are unclear. We combined a landscape-scale field study and glasshouse experiment to test how grassland management affects plant and soil N retention. Specifically, we hypothesised that extensively managed, species-rich grasslands of high conservation value would have lower N loss and greater N retention than intensively managed, species-poor grasslands, and that this would be due to a greater immobilisation of N by a more fungal-dominated microbial community. In the field study, we found that extensively managed, species-rich grasslands had lower N leaching losses. Soil inorganic N availability decreased with increasing abundance of fungi relative to bacteria, although the best predictor of soil N leaching was the C/N ratio of aboveground plant biomass. In the associated glasshouse experiment we found that retention of added <sup>15</sup>N was greater in extensively than in intensively managed grasslands, which was attributed to a combination of greater root uptake and microbial immobilisation of <sup>15</sup>N in the former, and that microbial immobilisation increased with increasing biomass and abundance of fungi. These findings show that grassland management affects mechanisms of N retention in soil through changes in root and microbial uptake of N. Moreover, they support the notion that microbial communities might be the key to improved N retention through tightening linkages between plants and microbes and reducing N availability.</p>

Is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease associated with increased arterial stiffness?
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize that airflow limitation is associated with increasing arterial stiffness and that having COPD increases a non-invasive measure of arterial stiffness - the aortic augmentation index (AIx) - independently of other CVD risk factors. METHODS: This population study is based on 3374 subjects from the Copenhagen City Heart Study; 494 had COPD. We used multiple linear regression analyses to examine the association between COPD and AIx adjusted for CVD risk factors. Furthermore, we analyzed the association between AIx and FEV(1), FVC and FEV(1)/FVC in the entire population. RESULTS: AIx was higher in subjects with COPD than in subjects without: 25.7 vs. 21.0 (p < 0.001) in men and 33.6 vs. 29.4 (p < 0.001) in women. We found no increase in AIx with COPD adjusted for CVD risk factors: difference 0.63 (-0.26 to 1.52, p = 0.16). In sensitivity analyses in subjects younger than 60 years with exclusion of mild COPD from the analyses, COPD was associated with an increase in AIx in men only of 4.1 (0.88-7.22, p = 0.007). AIx had a curvilinear association with FEV(1) and FVC but no association with the FEV(1)/FVC ratio. CONCLUSION: AIx and COPD are only weakly associated. In the general population, this finding argues against increased arterial stiffness, as measured by AIx, being a complication of COPD.

A Software-Supported Methodology for Exploring Interconnection Architectures Targeting 3-D FPGAs
Interconnect structures significantly contribute to the delay, power consumption, and silicon area of modern reconfigurable architectures. The demand for higher clock frequencies and logic densities is also important for the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) paradigm. Three-dimensional (3-D) integration can alleviate such performance limitations by accommodating a number of additional silicon layers. However, the benefits of 3-D integration have yet to be sufficiently investigated. In this paper, we propose a software-supported methodology to explore and evaluate 3-D FPGAs fabricated with alternative technologies. Based on the evaluation results, the proposed FPGA device improves speed and energy dissipation by approximately 38% and 26%, respectively, as compared to 2-D FPGAs. Furthermore, these gains are achieved in addition to reducing the interlayer connections, as compared to existing design approaches, leading to cheaper and more reliable architectures

Remodelling of cortical actin where lytic granules dock at natural killer cell immune synapses revealed by super-resolution microscopy.
Natural Killer (NK) cells are innate immune cells that secrete lytic granules to directly kill virus-infected or transformed cells across an immune synapse. However, a major gap in understanding this process is in establishing how lytic granules pass through the mesh of cortical actin known to underlie the NK cell membrane. Research has been hampered by the resolution of conventional light microscopy, which is too low to resolve cortical actin during lytic granule secretion. Here we use two high-resolution imaging techniques to probe the synaptic organisation of NK cell receptors and filamentous (F)-actin. A combination of optical tweezers and live cell confocal microscopy reveals that microclusters of NKG2D assemble into a ring-shaped structure at the centre of intercellular synapses, where Vav1 and Grb2 also accumulate. Within this ring-shaped organisation of NK cell proteins, lytic granules accumulate for secretion. Using 3D-structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) to gain super-resolution of ~100 nm, cortical actin was detected in a central region of the NK cell synapse irrespective of whether activating or inhibitory signals dominate. Strikingly, the periodicity of the cortical actin mesh increased in specific domains at the synapse when the NK cell was activated. Two-colour super-resolution imaging revealed that lytic granules docked precisely in these domains which were also proximal to where the microtubule-organising centre (MTOC) polarised. Together, these data demonstrate that remodelling of the cortical actin mesh occurs at the central region of the cytolytic NK cell immune synapse. This is likely to occur for other types of cell secretion and also emphasises the importance of emerging super-resolution imaging technology for revealing new biology.

We have used Affymetrix gene chip technology to look for changes in gene expression caused by a 24 h exposure of rat primary neonatal cardiac myocytes to the cardioprotective agent urocortin. We observed a 2.5-fold down-regulation at both the mRNA and protein levels of a specific calcium-insensitive phospholipase A2 enzyme. Levels of lysophosphatidylcholine, a toxic metabolite of phospholipase A2, were lowered by 30% in myocytes treated with urocortin for 24 h and by 50% with the irreversible iPLA2 inhibitor bromoenol lactone compared with controls. Both 4 h ischemia and ischemia followed by 24 h reperfusion caused a significant increase in lysophosphatidylcholine concentration compared with controls. When these myocytes were pretreated with urocortin, the ischemia-induced increase in lysophosphatidylcholine concentration was significantly lowered. Moreover, co-incubation of cardiac myocytes with urocortin, or the specific phospholipase A2 inhibitor bromoenol lactone, reduces the cytotoxicity produced by lysophosphatidylcholine or ischemia/reperfusion. Similarly, in the intact heart ex vivo we found that cardiac damage measured by infarct size was significantly increased when lysophoshatidylcholine was applied during ischemia, compared with ischemia alone, and that pre-treatment with both urocortin and bromoenol lactone reversed the increase in infarct size. This, to our knowledge, is the first study linking the cardioprotective effect of urocortin to a decrease in a specific enzyme protein and a subsequent decrease in the concentration of its cardiotoxic metabolite.

Cochlear implantation in patients profoundly deafened after head injury.
OBJECTIVE: There is very little information in the literature regarding outcomes of cochlear implantation in patients profoundly deafened after head injury. The aim of this study was to assess outcomes in this group of patients. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review. SETTING: The Manchester Cochlear Implant Programme, University of Manchester. PATIENTS: Profoundly deafened patients after head injury who proceeded to cochlear implantation for auditory rehabilitation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean age and duration of deafness at implantation. Preimplantation and postimplantation speech perception outcomes were measured using Bench Kowel Bamford (BKB) sentences in quiet and noise, City University of New York sentences with lip reading and Arthur Boothroyd words scoring the percentage phonemes correct. RESULTS: Twenty patients received 23 cochlear implants. Mean age at implantation was 51 years (standard deviation, 12 yr). Mean duration of deafness at implantation was 12 years (range, 1-30 yr).Preimplantation BKB score in quiet of 0%. Mean postimplantation BKB score in quiet was 64% (range, 0%-100%) and in noise was 61% (range, 0%-97%). Three were nonusers, and 1 required reimplantation. There was a moderately negative correlation between outcome and age at implantation (r = -0.41, p < 0.05) and between outcome and duration of deafness (r = -0.52, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Cochlear implantation is an effective method for hearing rehabilitation in profoundly deafened patients after head injury. However, negative factors, such as significant injury to the central auditory pathway, basal turn obliteration, long duration of deafness, and nonauditory stimulation, should be considered in the preoperative assessment of these patients.

numerical modelling of accelerated charged particles by magnetic reconnection in solar flares
In this thesis we introduce the fundamental theory leading to the occurrence of solar flares. Observations from different missions support theoretical postulates concerning the mechanism proposed for such events, ``magnetic reconnection'', where we illustrates its basic theory, and consider one of its most important consequences, ``particle acceleration''. DC electric field associated with magnetic reconnection is now widely studied as one of the primary processes of particle acceleration in solar flares. Individual particle trajectories and acceleration due to direct DC electric mechanism in solar flares are modelled here using two approaches. The first is the full particle trajectory approach by solving Lorentz equation of motion that fully describe particle's motion. To do so we wrote what we call the ``Full Code'' that solves numerically, using different methods, the Lorentz equation. The second approach, known by Guiding Centre Approximation (GCA) Theory, is widely used when particles behave adiabatically. For this approach we used an existing code called ``GCA'' to simulate particle trajectories. A full comparison is presented to show the applicability of the GCA theory and its efficiency and when it can be used. Both approaches operate on an analogous model trying to simulate magnetic reconnection leading to the formation of a current sheet where particles are primarily accelerated and gain sufficient energy allowing them to be ejected to the outer space or come back to the Sun's surface. We consider the 2-Dimensional MagnetoHydroDynamic ``MHD'' model generating data files for background fields which serve as an input for our particle trajectory codes. We extract some limitations for important parameters such as mass-to-charge ratio and grid size and perform experiments at different locations at the current sheet (at the centre, far away from the centre, and at magnetic islands) to fully discuss differences between the 2 approaches. This coupling between particle trajectory models and data on grid arising from finite difference models is studied numerically and analytically. Different numerical methods, relativistic effects, analytical configurations, particle specie and mass effects and some others are taken into account.

[tegaserod, study, symptom, bowel, treatment, ci, rr, ibs, gi]

Tegaserod for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.
BACKGROUND: IBS is a complex disorder that encompasses a wide profile of symptoms. Current drug treatments for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are of limited value. Many target specific symptoms only. Tegaserod, a 5HT(4) partial agonist, represents a novel mechanism of action in the treatment of IBS. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of tegaserod for the treatment of IBS in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and above. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE 1966-November 2002 and EMBASE 1980-November 2002 were searched. The text and key words used included "tegaserod", "HTF 919", "irritable bowel", and "colonic diseases, functional". The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Review Group Specialized Trials Register, and Science Citation Index were also searched. Proceedings from the British Society of Gastroenterology Annual Meeting, and Digestive Disease Week (1998-2002) were hand searched. The manufacturer of tegaserod was contacted. Relevant articles were retrieved, and their reference lists were also reviewed. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing tegaserod with placebo, no treatment or any other intervention (pharmacological or non-pharmacological) in subjects aged 12 years and above with a diagnosis of IBS, focusing on clinical endpoints were considered for review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Study inclusion and exclusion, data extraction and quality assessment was undertaken by two reviewers independently. Meta-analysis was performed where study populations, designs, outcomes, and statistical reporting allowed combination of data in a valid way, using the summary statistic relative risk with 95% CI. Eight short-term placebo-controlled studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria. These were predominantly conducted in women. Seven studies evaluated the efficacy of tegaserod on global gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in patients with constipation-predominant IBS (C-IBS). One small study evaluated safety in patients with diarrhoea-predominant IBS. MAIN RESULTS: The relative risk (RR) of being a responder in terms of global relief of GI symptoms was significantly higher with tegaserod 12 mg (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.09, 1.29) and tegaserod 4 mg (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.02, 1.31) compared with placebo, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 14 and 20 respectively. When all tegaserod doses were combined and compared with placebo (n=4040), the RR of being a responder was 1.17 (95% CI 1.08, 1.27), with a NNT of 17. Although the pooled results indicate statistically significant benefit with tegaserod, the a priori minimal clinically important differences set in two of the four pooled studies were not reached. Tegaserod did not significantly improve the patients' individual symptoms of abdominal pain and discomfort although bowel habit showed a statistically significant improvement with tegaserod 4 mg and there was a non-significant trend in favour of tegaserod 12 mg. When GI symptoms were assessed separately, those indicative of GI motility such as number of bowel movements and days without bowel movements were generally improved with tegaserod although the proportion of patients experiencing diarrhoea was significantly higher in the tegaserod 12 mg group compared with placebo (RR 2.75, 95% CI 1.90, 3.97), with a number needed to harm (NNH) of 20. Effects of tegaserod on GI symptoms such as bloating, stool consistency, and straining were not consistent across the studies. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Tegaserod appears to improve the overall symptomatology of IBS but there are currently few data on its effect on quality of life. In addition, more information is needed about its efficacy in men. It would also be of interest to know whether treatment with tegaserod leads either directly, or indirectly, to changes in visceral sensitivity or psychopathology, which are also considered important in the pathophysiology of this condition.

Nuclear Carrier and RNA Binding Proteins in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration associated with Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) pathological changes.
Aims:  We aimed to investigate the role of the nuclear carrier and binding proteins, transportin-1 (TRN1) and transportin-2 (TRN2), TATA-binding protein-associated factor 15 (TAF15) and Ewing's Sarcoma protein (EWS) in inclusion body formation in cases of Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD) associated with Fused in Sarcoma protein (FTLD-FUS). Methods:  Eight cases of FTLD-FUS (5 cases of atypical FTLD-U (aFTLD-U), 2 of Neuronal Intermediate Filament Inclusion Body Disease (NIFID) and 1 of Basophilic Inclusion Body Disease (BIBD)) were immunostained for FUS, TRN1, TRN2, TAF15 and EWS. 10 cases of FTLD associated with TDP-43 inclusions served as reference cases. Results:  The inclusion bodies in FTLD-FUS contained TRN1 and TAF15 and, to a lesser extent, EWS, but not TRN2. The patterns of immunostaining for TRN1 and TAF15 were very similar to that of FUS. None of these proteins was associated with tau or TDP-43 aggregations in FTLD. Conclusion:  Data suggest that FUS, TRN1 and TAF15 may participate in a functional pathway in an interdependent way, and imply that the function of TDP-43 may not necessarily be in parallel with, or complementary to, that of FUS, despite each protein sharing many similar structural elements. © 2012 The Authors.

CaGrid Workflow Toolkit: a Taverna based workflow tool for cancer grid.
BACKGROUND: In biological and medical domain, the use of web services made the data and computation functionality accessible in a unified manner, which helped automate the data pipeline that was previously performed manually. Workflow technology is widely used in the orchestration of multiple services to facilitate in-silico research. Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG) is an information network enabling the sharing of cancer research related resources and caGrid is its underlying service-based computation infrastructure. CaBIG requires that services are composed and orchestrated in a given sequence to realize data pipelines, which are often called scientific workflows. RESULTS: CaGrid selected Taverna as its workflow execution system of choice due to its integration with web service technology and support for a wide range of web services, plug-in architecture to cater for easy integration of third party extensions, etc. The caGrid Workflow Toolkit (or the toolkit for short), an extension to the Taverna workflow system, is designed and implemented to ease building and running caGrid workflows. It provides users with support for various phases in using workflows: service discovery, composition and orchestration, data access, and secure service invocation, which have been identified by the caGrid community as challenging in a multi-institutional and cross-discipline domain. CONCLUSIONS: By extending the Taverna Workbench, caGrid Workflow Toolkit provided a comprehensive solution to compose and coordinate services in caGrid, which would otherwise remain isolated and disconnected from each other. Using it users can access more than 140 services and are offered with a rich set of features including discovery of data and analytical services, query and transfer of data, security protections for service invocations, state management in service interactions, and sharing of workflows, experiences and best practices. The proposed solution is general enough to be applicable and reusable within other service-computing infrastructures that leverage similar technology stack.

Exploring the metabolic state of microorganisms using metabolomics
Microorganisms depend on their ability to modulate their metabolic composition according to specific circumstances, such as different phases of the growth cycle and circadian rhythms, fluctuations in environmental conditions, as well as experimental perturbations. A thorough understanding of these metabolic adaptations requires the ability to comprehensively identify and quantify the metabolome of bacterial cells in different states. In this review, we present an overview of the diverse metabolomics approaches recently adopted to explore the metabolism of a wide variety of microorganisms. Focusing on a selection of illustrative case studies, we assess the different experimental designs used and explore the major achievements and remaining challenges in the field. We conclude by discussing the important complementary information provided by computational methods such as genome-scale metabolic modeling, which enable an integrated analysis of metabolic state changes in the context of overall cellular physiology. ?? 2011 Future Science Ltd.

Superconductivity in gallium-substituted Ba8Si46 clathrates
We report a joint experimental and theoretical investigation of superconductivity in Ga-substituted type-I silicon clathrates. We prepared samples of the general formula Ba8Si46-xGax, with different values of x. We show that Ba8Si40Ga6 is a bulk superconductor, with an onset at T-C approximate to 3.3 K. For x=10 and higher, no superconductivity was observed down to T=1.8 K. This represents a strong suppression of superconductivity with increasing Ga content, compared to Ba8Si46 with T-C approximate to 8 K. Suppression of superconductivity can be attributed primarily to a decrease in the density of states at the Fermi level, caused by a reduced integrity of the sp(3)-hybridized networks as well as the lowering of carrier concentration. These results are corroborated by first-principles calculations, which show that Ga substitution results in a large decrease of the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, which explains the decreased superconducting critical temperature within the BCS framework. To further characterize the superconducting state, we carried out magnetic measurements showing Ba8Si40Ga6 to be a type-II superconductor. The critical magnetic fields were measured to be H-C1 approximate to 35 Oe and H-C2 approximate to 8.5 kOe. We deduce the London penetration depth lambda approximate to 3700 A and the coherence length xi(c)approximate to 200 A. Our estimate of the electron-phonon coupling reveals that Ba8Si40Ga6 is a moderate phonon-mediated BCS superconductor.

The histone deacetylase inhibitors vorinostat and romidepsin downmodulate IL-10 expression in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cells.
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Vorinostat and romidepsin are histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDI), approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). However, the mechanism(s) by which these drugs exert their anti-cancer effects are not fully understood. Since CTCL is associated with immune dysregulation, we investigated whether these HDI modulated cytokine expression in CTCL cells. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: CTCL cell lines and primary CTCL cells were treated in vitro with vorinostat or romidepsin, or with STAT3 pathway inhibitors. Cell cycle parameters and apoptosis were analysed by propidium iodide and annexin V/propidium iodide staining respectively. Cytokine expression was analysed using QRT-PCR and elisa assays. STAT3 expression/phosphorylation and transcriptional activity were analysed using immunoblotting and transfection/reporter assays respectively. KEY RESULTS: Vorinostat and romidepsin strongly down-regulated expression of the immunosuppressive cytokine, interleukin (IL)-10, frequently overexpressed in CTCL, at both the RNA and protein level in CTCL cell lines and at the RNA level in primary CTCL cells. Vorinostat and romidepsin also increased expression of IFNG RNA and decreased expression of IL-2 and IL-4 RNA, although to a lesser extent compared to IL-10. Transient exposure to vorinostat was sufficient to suppress IL-10 secretion but was not sufficient to irreversibly commit cells to undergo cell death. STAT3 pathway inhibitors decreased production of IL-10 and vorinostat/romidepsin partially decreased STAT3-dependent transcription without effects on STAT3 expression or phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These results demonstrate that HDI modulate cytokine expression in CTCL cells, potentially via effects on STAT3. Immunomodulation may contribute to the clinical activity of HDI in this disease.

'Birthright Citizenship and the ‘Mother-Child’ Subject: Reproducing the Nation/Reproducing the Self'
This paper considers critical responses to arguments regarding ‘anchor babies’ and ‘citizenship tourists’ in the context of ongoing changes to birthright citizenship legislation in recent years. This scholarship has emphasized the failure of such arguments to recognize the increasing permeable and fluid nature of national boundaries. The need to rethink the boundaries of political community in this context has been conceptualized predominantly through the question of therights which immigrant women and their children hold as individuals vis-à-vis the state. This paper, however, considers how citizen-subjectivity is not always exclusionable or inclusionable in political community as ‘individual’ woman or child in the last instance, as is presumed here. Rather, it explores how citizen-subjectivity often presents itself as a more ambiguous ‘motherchild’subject which is neither entirely one nor the other but “betwixt and between” (Shandy 2008). Drawing on the work of Julia Kristeva, this paper discusses how we can think through this fluidity of citizen-subjectivity in addition to the already highly emphasized fluidity of political community. It suggests that rethinking the boundaries of political subjectivity reconfigures our understanding of what citizenship (political community) can be in this context. For, although weare dealing with subjects who are citizens, they are citizens in a very different way to how this is normally conceptualized via commonality. Instead of being able to mark out and overcome exclusion, citizenship is defined here through processes of exclusion.

Spatiotemporal variability and long-term trends of ocean acidification in the California Current System
Due to seasonal upwelling, the upper ocean waters of the California Current System (CCS) have a naturally low pH and aragonite saturation state (Ωarag), making this region particularly prone to the effects of ocean acidification. Here, we use the Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS) to conduct preindustrial and transient (1995–2050) simulations of ocean biogeochemistry in the CCS. The transient simulations were forced with increasing atmospheric pCO2 and increasing oceanic dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations at the lateral boundaries, as projected by the NCAR CSM 1.4 model for the IPCC SRES A2 scenario. Our results show a large seasonal variability in pH (range of ~ 0.14) and Ωarag (~ 0.2) for the nearshore areas (50 km from shore). This variability is created by the interplay of physical and biogeochemical processes. Despite this large variability, we find that present-day pH and Ωarag have already moved outside of their simulated preindustrial variability envelopes (defined by ±1 temporal standard deviation) due to the rapidly increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2. The nearshore surface pH of the northern and central CCS are simulated to move outside of their present-day variability envelopes by the mid-2040s and late 2030s, respectively. This transition may occur even earlier for nearshore surface Ωarag, which is projected to depart from its present-day variability envelope by the early- to mid-2030s. The aragonite saturation horizon of the central CCS is projected to shoal into the upper 75 m within the next 25 yr, causing near-permanent undersaturation in subsurface waters. Due to the model's overestimation of Ωarag, this transition may occur even earlier than simulated by the model. Overall, our study shows that the CCS joins the Arctic and Southern oceans as one of only a few known ocean regions presently approaching the dual threshold of widespread and near-permanent undersaturation with respect to aragonite and a departure from its variability envelope. In these regions, organisms may be forced to rapidly adjust to conditions that are both inherently chemically challenging and also substantially different from past conditions.© The Author(s),  2013.

Detection of the acute effects of hydrocortisone in the hippocampus using pharmacological fMRI.
Impaired hippocampal function is believed to be important in the pathogenesis of depression. The hippocampus contains a high concentration of both mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR), and the experimental administration of corticosteroids has been reported to mimic memory impairments seen in depression. Using pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) we investigated whether hippocampal function is altered after acute administration of hydrocortisone. Changes in BOLD signal following infusion of 100mg hydrocortisone given as a rapid intravenous bolus were measured in 14 healthy volunteers in a within-subject placebo-controlled crossover design. Subsequently, subjects completed an n-back task during an fMRI scan. Hydrocortisone infusion caused a significant, time-dependent increase in fMRI BOLD signal in hippocampus reaching a maximal effect at 11-19min. The n-back task increased BOLD signal in prefrontal and parietal cortical areas and decreased it in the hippocampus. After hydrocortisone the left hippocampal decrease in BOLD signal was attenuated with the magnitude of attenuation correlating with the increase seen after hydrocortisone infusion. No difference in behavioural task performance was observed. The results suggest acute hydrocortisone has rapid direct and modulatory influences on hippocampal function, probably acting through non-genomic GR or MR signalling. Hydrocortisone infusion phMRI may be a useful tool to investigate hippocampal corticosteroid receptor function in depression.

Residual Stress and Phase Characterisation on Zirconium Oxides using Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction.
The present work was produced as part of the MUZIC consortium, a collaboration between a multi-university team from the UK and industrial partners working on the field of nuclear energy, fabrication of alloys and nuclear research. The aim of the project is to establish a multidiscipline mechanistic understanding of the corrosion and breakaway processes of zirconium alloys used as fuel cladding materials in the nuclear industry. A better understanding of the corrosion mechanism of zirconium alloys will not only aid the development of better performing alloys, but will also allow more accurate models to be developed to reliably predict the service life of existing alloys. This could lead to higher burn-up, increase of energy production and reduction of nuclear waste produced.This work seeks to provide a better understanding of the role of residual stresses in the oxide, which are produced during oxidation due to high Pilling-Bedworth ratio and their impact on oxide phase transformation and oxidation kinetics by employing high energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction techniques. This is achieved by observing how stresses change as oxide growth approaches and passes through transition of the corrosion kinetics, their evolution across the oxide thickness, in situ characterising stresses and phase growth early in oxidation process and how stress changes can affect corrosion properties.It was found that relatively high compressive stresses in the two oxide crystal structures are present. The stresses relax with time up to moments before transition where a possible threshold stress magnitude is reached to aid an extensive tetragonal to monoclinic phase transformation. This generalised tetragonal to monoclinic transformation is believed to produce highly stressed monoclinic crystal structure grains and cause defects in the oxide. The above observation is further supported by a decrease of the tetragonal zirconia content. This is the moment that the oxide looses its protective character and a transition of the corrosion kinetics occurs. By comparing different materials it was observed that the minimum magnitude of the tetragonal phase is lower in better performing alloys while the tetragonal content is some cases was relatively low. It is suggested that the amount of the tetragonal phase, in the oxide layer, is not as important as the rate of it transforming into monoclinic. The extent of tetragonal to monoclinic transformation, that introduces defects in the oxide, defines how protective an oxide layer is.The present work provides a contribution to the available knowledge of the importance of residual stresses in the oxide layer and metal substrate of zirconium alloys and how they can affect corrosion rates or act as a precursor to the corrosion transition.

Factors affecting recruitment to an observational multi-centre palliative care study.
Objectives To identify those factors which adversely affected recruitment to a large multicentre palliative care study. Methods Patient accrual to a multicentre, observational, palliative care study was monitored at three critical junctures in the research process. (1) Eligibility—did the patient fulfil the study entry criteria? (2) Accessibility—was it possible to access the patient to be able to inform them about the study? (3) Consent—did the patient agree to participate in the study? The reasons why patients were ineligible, inaccessible or refused consent were recorded. Results 12 412 consecutive referrals to participating clinical services were screened for study inclusion of whom 5394 (43%) were deemed to be ineligible. Of the remaining patients 4617/7018 (66%) were inaccessible to the research team. The most common reasons being precipitous death, ‘gatekeeping’ by clinical staff or rapid discharge. Of the 2410 patients who were visited by the research team and asked to participate in the study 1378 (57%) declined. Overall 8.2% (1018/12 412) of patients screened participated in the study. There were significant differences in recruitment patterns between hospice inpatient units, hospital support and community palliative care teams. Conclusions Systematic monitoring and analysis of patient flows through the clinical trial accrual process provided valuable insights about the reasons for failure to recruit patients to a clinical trial and may help to improve recruitment in future studies.

Validation of skin surface microtopography as a measure of skin photoaging in a subtropical population aged 40 and over.
BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that skin surface microtopography is a valid measure of photoaging among young adults, but whether this applies to older adults is unknown. METHODS: We investigated the association between degree of photoaging as measured by histological dermal elastosis and skin microtopography grades by decade of age from 40 to 89 years in a community sample in Australia. Skin surface replicas and punch biopsies were taken from 664 participants of the Nambour Skin Cancer Study. The association was assessed using ordinal logistic regression with proportional odds assumption, using histological dermal elastosis grades as outcome. RESULTS: There was significant increase in odds of higher skin surface microtopography grades with higher dermal elastosis grades for age groups below 70 years 40 to 49 years: odds ratio (OR) 2.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.68-5.22; 50 to 59 years: OR 3.78, 95% CI 2.28-6.26; 60 to 69 years: OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.41-4.35). The association was not significant for those 70 years or older. CONCLUSION: Skin surface microtopography grading system is a valid measure of degree of dermal elastosis for middle-aged and older adults up to 69 years but appears not to be valid for adults 70 years or more living in a high sun exposure setting.

Academic Literacy Practices: plausibility in the essays of a diverse social science cohort
This thesis addresses academic writing using two practice-led disciplines, academic literacies and ethnomethodology. It is first concerned to evaluate the possibilities of cooperation between these cognate endeavours, and concludes that where academic literacies provides a locus and set of topics for academic writing studies, ethnomethodology can contribute a sharpening of focus and of analytic tools. Ethnomethodology provides a reassuring message in that it confirms the value of detailed local studies, in this case of literacy. However, it is also the source of critique for those literacy scholars who have tried to site their studies in dualisms. This is seen as a rejection of situated studies. There is therefore a prominent methodological focus in this thesis. These methodological issues are then discussed in regard to how they translate into agendas and technologies for the study of social literacies. It is shown that ethnographic-type methods are necessary for such studies, even where they do not qualify as ‘full’ ethnographies by traditional standards. This study itself took on a quasi-ethnographic or ethnographic-type approach, using a longitudinal method to track the academic writing practices of eight undergraduate students with the aim of ascertaining the social and collaborative ways in which their work is accorded plausibility. Material from the study is presented in the form of interview analysis, and in a series of ethnographic case studies that use a variety of material, including interviews with students and staff, student essays, and various other materials that were accrued throughout the administrative life of the essays. Various methods for achieving or according plausibility, on the part of both students and staff, are discussed and analysed. Although all protagonists involved in essay writing and marking looked for and dealt in conventions wherever possible, the material presented here demonstrates that participants were generally aware of the limits to the possibilities of phenomena, and that there may be cause to locate, challenge, change, and adapt to the things that can acceptably be said and done in essay writing.

[protein, translocation, reticulum, endoplasmic, er, pathway]

Co-translational targeting and translocation of proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum.
Co-translational protein targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), represents an evolutionary-conserved mechanism to target proteins into the secretory pathway. In this targeting pathway proteins possessing signal sequences are recognised at the ribosome by the signal recognition particle while they are still undergoing synthesis. This triggers their delivery to the ER protein translocation channel, where they are directly translocated into the ER. Here we review the current understanding of this translocation pathway and how molecular details obtained in the related bacterial system have provided insight into the mechanism of targeting and translocation. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Functional and structural diversity of endoplasmic reticulum.

[skin, chemical, receptor, sensitization, danger, necessary]

Danger, intracellular signaling, and the orchestration of dendritic cell function in skin sensitization.
Allergic contact dermatitis is an important occupational and environmental disease caused by topical exposure to chemical allergens. An area of considerable interest and, in the context of hazard identification and characterization, an area of great importance is developing an understanding of the characteristics that confer on chemicals the ability to cause skin sensitization. For the successful acquisition of skin sensitization, it is necessary that a chemical must gain access to the viable epidermis, form stable immunogenic associations with host proteins, and provide the necessary stimuli for the activation, mobilization, and maturation of skin dendritic cells (DC). It is the last of these properties that is the subject of this article. The purpose here is to review the mechanisms through which skin sensitizers provide the triggers necessary for engagement of cutaneous DC. Of particular interest are the nature and function of danger signals elicited by skin sensitizing chemicals. Among the pathways considered here are those involving Toll-like receptors, C-type lectin receptors, neuropeptide receptors, prostanoid receptors, and the inflammasome. Collectively, danger signals in the skin provide a bridge between the innate and adaptive immune systems and are of pivotal importance for the initiation of cutaneous immune responses, including those to chemical allergens that result in skin sensitization.

KIRON: a computer system and a methodology applicable to the study of erythroid disorders
A methodology for the study of erythroid disorders by means of mathematical models and classification techniques is proposed, and KIRON, a comprehensive computer system for patient data entry, management, and analysis is described. KIRON is used in a hematologic laboratory for accurate collection of patient data and for conversational access to the data for processing with model-based parameter estimation techniques, statistical descriptive, multivariate, and pattern-recognition techniques. The user-interface software is designed for convenience of a noncomputer-expert user throughout the whole range of functions performed by the system. System application (a) in the data collection routine, (b) for improving the diagnostic process in clinical routine, (c) for developing a data bank oriented to the study of erythroid disorders, and (d) for analyzing the data bank through the exploratory research strategy are discussed. The system software is entirely written in Fortran and operates under the time-sharing system of a Honeywell 6040 computer.

High tryptophan diet reduces CA1 intraneuronal β-amyloid in the triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that impairs mnesic functions. The histopathology of the disease is manifested by the accumulation of intracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) and subsequent formation of neuritic plaques as well as the presence neurofibrillary tangles in specific brain regions associated with learning and memory including the hippocampus. Here, we analysed the effect of chronic (1 month) food diets containing low (LTrP), normal (NTrP) and high tryptophan (HTrP), 0.04, 0.20 and 0.40 g/100 g, respectively, on CA1 serotonin transporter (SERT) fibre density, intraneuronal Aβ deposition and total number of serotonergic (5-HT) neurons in an AD triple transgenic (3xTg-AD) mouse model. Nontransgenic (non-Tg) animals fed with HTrP displayed increased SERT fibre density in CA1 (35%) and in stratum lacunosum moleculare (S.Mol) (48%) compared to LTrP diet. Transgenic animals showed increased SERT fibre density in CA1 S.Mol compared to diet-matched non-Tg irrespective of dietary tryptophan content (104% for LTrP, 74% for NTrP and 35% for HTrP); no differences were observed in the total number of 5-HT neurons neither in the dorsal nor in the median raphe nuclei. However, and more relevant to AD, HTrP diet reduced intraneuronal Aβ density (by a 17%) in transgenic animals compared to transgenic animals fed with NTrP diet. Our results show that increased dietary TrP intake reduces intraneuronal Aβ load in the 3xTg-AD mouse model of AD, suggesting that enhanced TrP intake and in consequence a potential increase in 5-HT neurotransmission may be effective in reducing plaque pathology in AD.

Millimetre Wave Substrate Integrated Waveguide Antennas: Design and Fabrication Analysis
<p>The paper presents a new concept in antenna design, whereby a photo-imageable thick-film process is used to integrate a waveguide antenna within a multilayer structure. This has yielded a very compact, high performance antenna working at high millimeter-wave (mm-wave) frequencies, with a high degree of repeatability and reliability in antenna construction. Theoretical and experimental results for 70 GHz mm-wave integrated antennas, fabricated using the new technique, are presented. The antennas were formed from miniature slotted waveguide arrays using up to 18 layers of photo-imageable material. To enhance the electrical performance a novel folded waveguide array was also investigated. The fabrication process is analyzed in detail and the critical issues involved in the fabrication cycle are discussed. The losses in the substrate integrated waveguide have been calculated. The performance of the new integrated antenna is compared to conventional metallic, air-filled waveguide antennas, and also to conventional microstrip antenna arrays operating at the same frequencies.</p>

Targeted deletion of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 5 attenuates hypertrophic response and promotes pressure overload-induced apoptosis in the heart.
RATIONALE: Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways provide a critical connection between extrinsic and intrinsic signals to cardiac hypertrophy. Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK)5, an atypical MAPK is activated in the heart by pressure overload. However, the role of ERK5 plays in regulating hypertrophic growth and hypertrophy-induced apoptosis is not completely understood. OBJECTIVE: Herein, we investigate the in vivo role and signaling mechanism whereby ERK5 regulates cardiac hypertrophy and hypertrophy-induced apoptosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: We generated and examined the phenotypes of mice with cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of the erk5 gene (ERK5(cko)). In response to hypertrophic stress, ERK5(cko) mice developed less hypertrophic growth and fibrosis than controls. However, increased apoptosis together with upregulated expression levels of p53 and Bad were observed in the mutant hearts. Consistently, we found that silencing ERK5 expression or specific inhibition of its kinase activity using BIX02189 in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) reduced myocyte enhancer factor (MEF)2 transcriptional activity and blunted hypertrophic responses. Furthermore, the inhibition of MEF2 activity in NRCMs using a non-DNA binding mutant form of MEF2 was found to attenuate the ERK5-regulated hypertrophic response. CONCLUSIONS: These results reveal an important function of ERK5 in cardiac hypertrophic remodeling and cardiomyocyte survival. The role of ERK5 in hypertrophic remodeling is likely to be mediated via the regulation of MEF2 activity.

[cd8, hepatocyte, t-cell, cell, function, antigen, virus-specific, viral]

The level of viral antigen presented by hepatocytes influences CD8 T-cell function.
CD8 T cells exert their antiviral function through cytokines and lysis of infected cells. Because hepatocytes are susceptible to noncytolytic mechanisms of viral clearance, CD8 T-cell antiviral efficiency against hepatotropic viruses has been linked to their capacity to produce gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). On the other hand, intrahepatic cytokine production triggers the recruitment of mononuclear cells, which sustain acute and chronic liver damage. Using virus-specific CD8 T cells and human hepatocytes, we analyzed the modulation of virus-specific CD8 T-cell function after recognition peptide-pulsed or virally infected hepatocytes. We observed that hepatocyte antigen presentation was generally inefficient, and the quantity of viral antigen strongly influenced CD8 T-cell antiviral function. High levels of hepatitis B virus production induced robust IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha production in virus-specific CD8 T cells, while limiting amounts of viral antigen, both in hepatocyte-like cells and naturally infected human hepatocytes, preferentially stimulated CD8 T-cell degranulation. Our data document a mechanism where virus-specific CD8 T-cell function is influenced by the quantity of virus produced within hepatocytes.

This is a companion text to the ethnographic documentary Ronin, Plants & Dreams filmed among the indigenous Shipibo people of the Peruvian Amazonia. Artisans within this community drink the juice of the medicinal plant kene huaste with the hope of dreaming with Ronin – a powerful being who teaches them in the art of painting geometric patterns. Ronin lives in the lakes and lagoons near Shipibo villages and appears to Shipibo as a fearful serpent in waking life, but as a knowledgeable human to be learned from in dreams and visions. The film is an exploration in the theme of dreaming with Ronin and follows an artisan’s search for designs. The companion text contextualises the film by introducing ethnographic literature on indigenous Amazonia, as well as my own fieldwork experiences. It also reflects on the process of making the film and discusses how ethnographic knowledge is created and communicated.

[cell, memory, lymph, infection, node]

Long-term persistence and reactivation of T cell memory in the lung of mice infected with respiratory syncytial virus.
In mice acutely infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), more than 20% of pulmonary CD8(+) T cells, but only 2-3% of CD8(+) T cells in the draining lymph node secreted interferon-gamma in response to a single peptide. Surprisingly, the percentage of virus-specific T cells in the lung remained at these high levels long after the acute infection. Pulmonary memory T cells were further studied in a sensitive adoptive transfer system, which allows visualizing polyclonal CD4(+) and CD8(+) virus-specific memory T cell responses. Fifty days after infection, persisting RSV-specific pulmonary T cells remained CD69(hi) CD62L(lo), but had returned to a resting memory state according to functional criteria. In the absence of neutralizing antibodies reinfection first induced cell division among virus-specific memory T cells 3 days after infection predominantly in the local lymph node. However, divided cells then rapidly accumulated in the lung without significantly increasing in the lymph node. These results suggest rapid export of reactivated cells from the lymph node to the target organ. Thus, although memory T cells can be maintained in the infected organ after a localized virus infection, amplification of a recall response appears to be most effective in organized lymphoid tissue.

Semiclassical framework for the calculation of transport anisotropies
We present a procedure for finding the exact solution to the linear-response Boltzmann equation for two-dimensional anisotropic systems and demonstrate it on examples of noncrystalline anisotropic magnetoresistance in a system with spin-orbit interaction. We show that two decoupled integral equations must be solved in order to find the nonequilibrium distribution function up to linear order in the applied electric field. The examples are all based on the Rashba system with charged magnetic scatterers, a system where the nonequilibrium distribution function and anisotropic magnetoresistance can be evaluated analytically. Exact results are compared to earlier widely used approximative approaches. We find circumstances under which approximative approaches may become unreliable even on a qualitative level.

The Incidence of worklessness among new immigrants in England
This paper investigates the incidence of worklessness among recent immigrants in England using data from the Labour Force Survey and logistic multilevel modelling. The model takes into account individual and contextual factors impacting upon the risk of worklessness of immigrants from ‘established’ and ‘new’ immigrant groups. The results suggest that the disadvantage of non-white immigrants in England persists, with recent immigrants from Bangladesh and Pakistan found to have higher odds of worklessness than other immigrants. Non-white immigrants originating in countries outside the Commonwealth are found to be nearly as disadvantaged in the labour market. Conversely, immigrants from the EU Accession countries are found to be less likely to be workless compared to other immigrant groups. The results also suggest that contextual factors influence the incidence of worklessness among new immigrants with those living in the most deprived areas or in ethically dense areas facing a higher risk of worklessness.

Genome-wide association analysis identifies variants associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease that have distinct effects on metabolic traits.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) clusters in families, but the only known common genetic variants influencing risk are near PNPLA3. We sought to identify additional genetic variants influencing NAFLD using genome-wide association (GWA) analysis of computed tomography (CT) measured hepatic steatosis, a non-invasive measure of NAFLD, in large population based samples. Using variance components methods, we show that CT hepatic steatosis is heritable (∼26%-27%) in family-based Amish, Family Heart, and Framingham Heart Studies (n = 880 to 3,070). By carrying out a fixed-effects meta-analysis of genome-wide association (GWA) results between CT hepatic steatosis and ∼2.4 million imputed or genotyped SNPs in 7,176 individuals from the Old Order Amish, Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik study (AGES), Family Heart, and Framingham Heart Studies, we identify variants associated at genome-wide significant levels (p<5×10(-8)) in or near PNPLA3, NCAN, and PPP1R3B. We genotype these and 42 other top CT hepatic steatosis-associated SNPs in 592 subjects with biopsy-proven NAFLD from the NASH Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN). In comparisons with 1,405 healthy controls from the Myocardial Genetics Consortium (MIGen), we observe significant associations with histologic NAFLD at variants in or near NCAN, GCKR, LYPLAL1, and PNPLA3, but not PPP1R3B. Variants at these five loci exhibit distinct patterns of association with serum lipids, as well as glycemic and anthropometric traits. We identify common genetic variants influencing CT-assessed steatosis and risk of NAFLD. Hepatic steatosis associated variants are not uniformly associated with NASH/fibrosis or result in abnormalities in serum lipids or glycemic and anthropometric traits, suggesting genetic heterogeneity in the pathways influencing these traits.

Alosetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, delays colonic transit in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and healthy volunteers.
BACKGROUND: Alosetron is a potent and selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, which has been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of female patients with non-constipated irritable bowel syndrome. AIMS: To investigate the effect of alosetron on whole gut, small bowel and colonic transit in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (Study 1) and healthy volunteers (Study 2). SUBJECTS: Thirteen patients with irritable bowel syndrome and 12 healthy volunteers. METHODS: Both studies were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled with a two-way crossover design, in which each subject received alosetron (2 mg b.d. administered orally) or placebo for 8 days. Mean whole gut transit was determined from the excretion of radio-opaque markers; small bowel transit was determined from rise in breath hydrogen after a meal; and colonic transit and segmental transit were evaluated from abdominal X-ray. In addition, colonic transit was calculated by subtracting small bowel transit time from whole gut transit time. RESULTS: Alosetron increased colonic transit time by prolonging left colonic transit in both patients with irritable bowel syndrome and controls. This resulted in a tendency for the whole gut transit to be delayed in irritable bowel syndrome patients (P=0.128), which was confirmed in controls (P=0.047). CONCLUSION: Alosetron delays colonic transit by prolonging left colonic transit. These results add to the body of evidence suggesting that alosetron should have a therapeutic role in patients with non-constipated irritable bowel syndrome.

[rct, compression, bandage, healing, month, ulcer, system, outcome, small, elastic]

Compression for venous leg ulcers.
BACKGROUND: Up to one percent of people in industrialised countries will suffer from a leg ulcer at some time. The majority of these leg ulcers are due to problems in the veins, resulting in an accumulation of blood in the legs. Leg ulcers arising from venous problems are called venous (or varicose or stasis) ulcers. The main treatment is the application of a firm compression garment (bandage or stocking) in order to aid venous return. There is a large number of compression garments available and it was unclear whether they are effective in treating venous ulcers and, if so, which method of compression is the most effective. OBJECTIVES: To undertake a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects on venous ulcer healing of compression bandages and stockings.Specific questions addressed by the review are:1. Does the application of compression bandages or stockings aid venous ulcer healing? 2. Which compression bandage or stocking system is the most effective? SEARCH METHODS: For this second update we searched: the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (31 May 2012); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 5, 2012); Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to May Week 4 2012); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations 30 May 2012); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 2012 Week 21); and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 30 May 2012). No date or language restrictions were applied. SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs recruiting people with venous leg ulceration that evaluated any type of compression bandage system or compression stockings were eligible for inclusion. Eligible comparators included no compression (e.g. primary dressing alone, non-compressive bandage) or an alternative type of compression. RCTs had to report an objective measure of ulcer healing in order to be included (primary outcome for the review). Secondary outcomes of the review included ulcer recurrence, costs, quality of life, pain, adverse events and withdrawals. There was no restriction on date, language or publication status of RCTs. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Details of eligible studies were extracted and summarised using a data extraction table. Data extraction was performed by one review author and verified independently by a second review author. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-eight RCTs reporting 59 comparisons were included (4321 participants in total). Most RCTs were small, and most were at unclear or high risk of bias. Duration of follow-up varied across RCTs. Risk ratio (RR) and other estimates are shown below where RCTs were pooled; otherwise findings refer to a single RCT.There was evidence from eight RCTs (unpooled) that healing outcomes (including time to healing) are better when patients receive compression compared with no compression.Single-component compression bandage systems are less effective than multi-component compression for complete healing at six months (one large RCT).A two-component system containing an elastic bandage healed more ulcers at one year than one without an elastic component (one small RCT).Three-component systems containing an elastic component healed more ulcers than those without elastic at three to four months (two RCTs pooled), RR 1.83 (95% CI 1.26 to 2.67), but another RCT showed no difference between groups at six months.An individual patient data meta-analysis of five RCTs suggested significantly faster healing with the four-layer bandage (4LB) than the short stretch bandage (SSB): median days to healing estimated at 90 and 99 respectively; hazard ratio 1.31 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.58).High-compression stockings are associated with better healing outcomes than SSB at two to four months: RR 1.62 (95% CI 1.26 to 2.10), estimate from four pooled RCTs.One RCT suggested better healing outcomes at 16 months with the addition of a tubular device plus single elastic bandage to a base system of gauze and crepe bandages when compared with two added elastic bandages. Another RCT had three arms; when one or two elastic bandages were added to a base three-component system that included an outer tubular layer, healing outcomes were better at six months for the two groups receiving elastic bandages.There is currently no evidence of a statistically significant difference for the following comparisons:⋅alternative single-component compression bandages (two RCTs, unpooled);⋅two-component bandages compared with the 4LB at three months (three RCTs pooled);⋅alternative versions of the 4LB for complete healing at times up to and including six months (three RCTs, unpooled);⋅4LB compared with paste bandage for complete healing at three months (two RCTs, pooled), six months or one year (one RCT for each time point);⋅adjustable compression boots compared with paste bandages for the outcome of change in ulcer area at three months (one small RCT);⋅adjustable compression boots compared with the 4LB with respect to complete healing at three months (one small RCT);⋅single-layer compression stocking compared with paste bandages for outcome of complete healing at four months (one small RCT) and 18 months (another small RCT);⋅low compression stocking compared with SSB for complete healing at three and six months (one small RCT);⋅compression stockings compared with a two-component bandage system and the 4LB for the outcome of complete healing at three months (one small, three-armed RCT); and,⋅tubular compression compared with SSB (one small RCT) for complete healing at three months.Secondary outcomes: 4LB was more cost-effective than SSB. It was not possible to draw firm conclusions regarding other secondary outcomes including recurrence, adverse events and health-related quality of life. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Compression increases ulcer healing rates compared with no compression. Multi-component systems are more effective than single-component systems. Multi-component systems containing an elastic bandage appear to be more effective than those composed mainly of inelastic constituents. Two-component bandage systems appear to perform as well as the 4LB. Patients receiving the 4LB heal faster than those allocated the SSB. More patients heal on high-compression stocking systems than with the SSB. Further data are required before the difference between high-compression stockings and the 4LB can be established.

Crustal structure of rifted and convergent margins : the U.S. East Coast and Aleutian margins
Many of the most important processes that create and modify continental crust occur
at continental margins, but recently has the scientific community acquired the necessary
intrumentation to image crustal structure across margins in detail. In this thesis we
investigate the crustal structure across the U.S. East Coast rifted margin and the convergent
margin of southwestern Alaska using modern, deep-penetrating marine seismic
reflection/refraction data.
We consider U.S. East Coast margin transects along the shelf offshore Georgia and
across the mid-Atlantic margin near Chesapeak bay. Results by other workers, based on
data from these transects, have shown that voluminous volcanism accompanied formation
of the rifted margin during continental breakup. Results presented in this thesis constrain
the landward extent of rift-related magmatic emplacement. We find that magmatic intrusion
and underplating of pre-existing continental crust occurs primarily in extended crust and
that crustal extension is focused in a 75-km-wide region beneath the shelf and slope. The
crust thinned by 50 to 80% within this interval and then seafloor spreading began with an
unusually large volume of igneous crust production. The initial volcanic extrusives were
emplaced subaerially and are now present beneath the sediments in a thick seaward-dipping
wedge. We use post-stack depth migration to image this wedge and use the resulting image
to consider the early subsidence of the margin. The geometry of the subaerially extruded
rift volcanics suggest that the margin subsided rapidly once volncanism began. We infer
from the subsidence, the along-margin distribution of magmatic material, and the across-margin
localization of magmatic emplacement and deformation that the U.S. East Coast rift
volcanics had an anomalously-hot mantle source whose distribution beneath the lithosphere
prior to rifting was long (the length of the margin) but not deep. We speculate that the
distribution of this material was controlled by topography at the base of the lithosphere
inherited from the Paleozoic collision of North America and Africa. Our analysis of the southwestern Alaska convergent margin is based on data from
the 1994 Aleutian seismic experiment. The crust of most of Alaska has been built through
terrane accretion and arc magmatism, and this experiment was conducted to study the
evolution of continental crust through these processes. We consider transects across the
westernmost Alaska Peninsula margin, where subduction is occurring beneath protocontinental
crust composed of oceanic-arc terranes accreted in the Cretaceous, and across
Bristol Bay in the back arc region where the crust has undergone a number of geologic
events since accretion. Across the Peninsula, we find that the velocity structure of the
accreted terranes differs little from that of the Cenozoic Aleutian oceanic-arc crust west of
the Peninsula determined along another transect of this experiment. The accreted oceanicarc
terranes are considerably more mafic than continental crust and the process of accretion
has apparently not modified the bulk composition of these terranes toward that of average
continental crust. It is possible that Cenozoic arc magmatism has been more felsic in
composition than that which formed the accreted terranes and the Aleutian oceanic arc to the
west, and that these magmas have been emplaced primarily within the crust inboard of the
accreted terranes which lie south of the currently active arc. The geology of the Bristol Bay
region suggests that the crustal components here had an origin similar to that of the Alaska
Peninsula margin- that is, accreted terranes. We find, however, that the crust beneath
Bristol Bay has a typically continental velocity structure. If this crust originally had a
structure similar to the Alaska Peninsula margin, then at least two processes must have
occured to affect the transformation to its current structure: crustal thickening and removal
of the mafic lower crust. The geologic events that have affected this region since accretion
are consistent with such and evolution.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution May 199

[themis2, macrophage, protein, production, tnf, lps-induced]

Themis2/ICB1 is a signaling scaffold that selectively regulates macrophage Toll-like receptor signaling and cytokine production.
BACKGROUND: Thymocyte expressed molecule involved in selection 1 (Themis1, SwissProt accession number Q8BGW0) is the recently characterised founder member of a novel family of proteins. A second member of this family, Themis2 (Q91YX0), also known as ICB1 (Induced on contact with basement membrane 1), remains unreported at the protein level despite microarray and EST databases reporting Themis2 mRNA expression in B cells and macrophages. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we characterise Themis2 protein for the first time and show that it acts as a macrophage signalling scaffold, exerting a receptor-, mediator- and signalling pathway-specific effect on TLR responses in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Themis2 over-expression enhanced the LPS-induced production of TNF but not IL-6 or Cox-2, nor TNF production induced by ligands for TLR2 (PAM3) or TLR3 (poly IratioC). Moreover, LPS-induced activation of the MAP kinases ERK and p38 was enhanced in cells over-expressing Themis2 whereas the activation of JNK, IRF3 or NF-kappaB p65, was unaffected. Depletion of Themis2 protein by RNA inteference inhibited LPS-induced TNF production in primary human macrophages demonstrating a requirement for Themis2 in this event. Themis2 was inducibly tyrosine phosphorylated upon LPS challenge and interacted with Lyn kinase (P25911), the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Vav (P27870), and the adaptor protein Grb2 (Q60631). Mutation of either tyrosine 660 or a proline-rich sequence (PPPRPPK) simultaneously interrupted this complex and reduced by approximately 50% the capacity of Themis2 to promote LPS-induced TNF production. Finally, Themis2 protein expression was induced during macrophage development from murine bone marrow precursors and was regulated by inflammatory stimuli both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We hypothesise that Themis2 may constitute a novel, physiological control point in macrophage inflammatory responses.

Genetic variants in the catechol-o-methyltransferase gene are associated with impulsivity and executive function: Relevance for major depression.
The catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) gene has been extensively investigated in depression with somewhat contradictory results but the role of impulsivity, as a possible intermediate phenotype in this disorder, has not been considered yet. In our study, four tagging SNPs in the COMT gene (rs933271, rs740603, rs4680, rs4646316) were genotyped in two independent population cohorts: Manchester (n = 1267) and Budapest (n = 942). First, we investigated the association between COMT genotypes, impulsivity, neuroticism and depression using haplotype trend regression, and constructed a model using structural equation modeling to investigate the interaction between these factors. Secondly, we tested the effect of executive function on this model in a smaller interviewed sample (n = 207). Our results demonstrated that COMT haplotypes were significantly associated with impulsivity in the combined cohort, showing the same direction of effects in both populations. The COMT effect on depressive symptoms (in subjects without history of depression) and on executive function (interviewed sample) showed the opposite pattern to impulsivity. Structural equation models demonstrated that COMT and impulsivity acted, both together (through neuroticism) and independently, to increase the risk of depression. In addition, better executive function also operated as a risk factor for depression, possibly though reduced ability to flexibly disengage negative emotions. In conclusion, variations in the COMT gene exert complex effects on susceptibility to depression involving various intermediate phenotypes, such as impulsivity and executive function. These findings emphasise that modeling of disease pathways at phenotypic level are valuable for identifying genetic risk factors. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

[nail, terbinafine, fragment, fungus, dermatophyte, action]

Inhibitory effect of terbinafine on the invasion of nails by Trichophyton mentagrophytes.
BACKGROUND: Terbinafine has a broad spectrum of action in vitro and primary fungicidal action against many pathogenic fungi. Its mode of action against dermatophyte fungi in nail keratin is little understood. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the bioavailability of terbinafine in a nail fragment model. METHODS: The effect of terbinafine on adherence and germination of arthroconidia of Trichophyton mentagrophytes on nail fragments was assessed by gross examination and light and electron microscopy. RESULTS: Preexposure of nail fragments to terbinafine concentrations (0.001 to 10 mg/L) inhibited fungal growth and acted as a barrier to dermatophyte invasion. Damaged arthroconidia and distorted hyphae on the surface of nail fragments were observed. CONCLUSION: This in vitro model provides an alternative system for studying the activity of antifungal agents in nail and demonstrates the morphologic changes in dermatophyte fungi after exposure to terbinafine.

Measurement of the Electron Charge Asymmetry in Inclusive W Production in pp Collisions at √s=7  TeV
A measurement of the electron charge asymmetry in inclusive pp→W+X→eν+X production at √s=7  TeV is presented based on data recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 840  pbsuperscript -1. The electron charge asymmetry reflects the unequal production of Wsuperscript + and Wsuperscript - bosons in pp collisions. The electron charge asymmetry is measured in bins of the absolute value of electron pseudorapidity in the range of |η|<2.4. The asymmetry rises from about 0.1 to 0.2 as a function of the pseudorapidity and is measured with a relative precision better than 7%. This measurement provides new stringent constraints for parton distribution functions.

Superior effect of combination vs. single steroid therapy in keloid disease: a comparative in vitro analysis of glucocorticoids.
Keloid disease (KD) is a fibroproliferative disorder of unknown etiology. Current use of corticosteroid injection is partially beneficial with 80% recurrence rate. Additionally, the efficacy of different steroids, alone or in combination as opposed to monotherapy, in treating KD remains unclear. Here, we compared the single and combined efficacy of glucocorticoids-dexamethasone (Dex), triamcinolone (TAC), and methylprednisolone (Medrol)-on primary keloid fibroblasts (KFs) (n = 27) and normal skin (n = 19) fibroblasts at cellular, protein, and messenger RNA levels in vitro. Our results demonstrated that cytotoxicity to steroids was dose dependent. Cell spreading, attachment, and proliferation were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced by Medrol and TAC. Migration and invasion properties of KF were inhibited significantly (p < 0.05) by Medrol and TAC compared with Dex. At both protein and messenger RNA levels, keloid-associated fibrotic markers were significantly (p < 0.05) decreased by Medrol and TAC compared with Dex. However, vascular endothelial growth factor expression was significantly (p = 0.01) decreased by Dex compared with TAC and Medrol. Medrol and TAC caused significant (p < 0.04) apoptosis, whereas Dex inhibited the UV-induced apoptosis and up-regulated survivin. Blocking of glucocorticoid receptor by RU486 inhibited cytoprotective property of Dex and apoptotic properties of TAC and Medrol. Double treatment with Dex + TAC and Dex + Medrol significantly (p < 0.05) induced apoptosis. In conclusion, this is the first study to report the efficacy of three well-known steroids on KF and suggest that combination may be superior than using a single steroid in treating KD.

Evaluation of state and trait biomarkers in healthy volunteers for the development of novel drug treatments in schizophrenia.
Antipsychotic drugs are the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia but they have little effect on core negative symptoms or cognitive impairment. To meet the deficiencies of current treatments, novel potential compounds are emerging from preclinical research but translation to clinical success has been poor. This article evaluates the possibility that cognitive and physiological abnormalities in schizophrenia can be used as central nervous system biomarkers to predict, in healthy volunteers, the likely efficacy of entirely new pharmacological approaches to treatment. Early detection of efficacy would focus resource on rapidly developing, effective drugs. We review the relevance of selected cognitive and physiological abnormalities as biomarkers in schizophrenia and three of its surrogate populations: (i) healthy volunteers with high trait schizotypy; (ii) unaffected relatives of patients; and (iii) healthy volunteers in a state of cortical glutamate disinhibition induced by low-dose ketamine. Several biomarkers are abnormal in these groups and in some instances there has been exploratory work to determine their sensitivity to drug action. They are generally insensitive to current antipsychotics and therefore their predictive validity cannot be established until novel, therapeutically useful drugs are discovered. Until then such biomarker studies can provide evidence of drugs engaging with the mechanism of interest and encouragement of the concept.

A Fibrin-Based Tissue-Engineered Renal Proximal Tubule for Bioartificial Kidney Devices: Development, Characterization and In Vitro Transport Study
A bioartificial renal proximal tubule is successfully engineered as a first step towards a bioartificial kidney for improved renal substitution therapy. To engineer the tubule, a tunable hollow fiber membrane with an exterior skin layer that provides immunoprotection for the cells from extracapillary blood flow and a coarse inner surface that facilitates a hydrogel coating for cell attachment was embedded in a “lab-on-a-chip” model for the small-scale exploratory testing under flow conditions. Fibrin was coated onto the inner surface of the hollow fiber, and human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells were then seeded. Using this model, we successfully cultured a confluent monolayer, as ascertained by immunofluorescence staining for ZO-1 tight junctions and other proximal tubule markers, scanning electron microscopy, and FITC-inulin recovery studies. Furthermore, the inulin studies, combined with the creatinine and glucose transport profiles, suggested that the confluent monolayer exhibits functional transport capabilities. The novel approaches here may eventually improve current renal substitution technology for renal failure patients.

The Uses, Meanings, and Values of Natural Objects: University earth science objects and collections as material culture
As an academic discipline, the earth sciences generate, use, and retain vast quantities of objects. This ‘material archive’ exists, first and foremost, as a functional scientific resource; the objects that it contains were never intended to express culture. Since the earth sciences rely heavily on claims that its objects of study remain the same as they were in nature, it follows that the specimens contained in university earth science collections are treated as objective scientific evidence. In this sense, the material that is collected, used and retained by earth scientists may appear to be devoid of culture – passive, inert and neutral.This thesis sets out to challenge these assumptions by treating university earth science objects and collections as material culture. In material culture studies, geological materials appear in a variety of different forms and contexts, however, such work has tended to focus on either their occurrence in the landscape, or their use as raw materials from which objects are made. Thus, while the earth sciences provide an abundant source of ‘material’ for material culture studies, rarely (if at all) do they seem to provide the culture. Furthermore, while the treatment of ‘natural’ objects as cultural artefacts has become increasingly popular in museology, much of this work has concentrated on the processes and practices that are enacted on these things in museums. Museology has therefore tended to consider these things in what effectively corresponds to their retirement, meaning that with few exceptions, little attention has been paid to their active use as functional scientific objects. This research explores the implications of treating university earth science objects and collections as material culture through the empirical investigation of contemporary object-related practices in UK earth science departments and university museums. As such this thesis addresses questions surrounding the relevance of existing theories and methods, in both material culture studies and museology, for exploring natural scientific objects and collections. These questions are approached through four thematic chapters concerned with the coming into being of earth science objects, their transformation into collection items, their functions, and their mobility.

Microscopic mechanism of the noncrystalline anisotropic magnetoresistance in (Ga,Mn)As
Starting with a microscopic model based on the Kohn-Luttinger Hamiltonian and kinetic p-d exchange combined with Boltzmann formula for conductivity we identify the scattering from magnetic Mn combined with the strong spin-orbit interaction of the GaAs valence band as the dominant mechanism of the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) in (Ga,Mn)As. This fact allows to construct a simple analytical model of the AMR consisting of two heavy-hole bands whose charge carriers are scattered on the impurity potential of the Mn atoms. The model predicts the correct sign of the AMR (resistivity parallel to magnetization is smaller than perpendicular to magnetization) and identifies its origin arising from the destructive interference between electric and magnetic part of the scattering potential of magnetic ionized Mn acceptors when the carriers move parallel to the magnetization.

[debt]

Optimal Public Debt Management and Liquidity Provision
We study the Ramsey policy problem in an economy in which firms face a collateral constraint.  Issuing more public debt alleviates this friction by increasing the aggregate quantity of collateral. In so doing, however, the issuance of more debt also raises interest rates, which in turn increases the tax burden of servicing the entire outstanding debt. We first document how this trade-off upsets the optimality of tax smoothing and, in contrast to the standard paradigm, helps induce a unique and stable steady-state level of debt in the deterministic version of the model. We next study the optimal policy response to fiscal and financial shocks in the stochastic version. We finally show how the results extend to a variant model in which the financial friction afflicts consumers rather than firms.

Desmophyllum dianthus (Esper, 1794) in the scleractinian phylogeny and its intraspecific diversity
The cosmopolitan solitary deep-water scleractinian coral Desmophyllum dianthus (Esper, 1794) was selected as a representative model species of the polyphyletic Caryophylliidae family to (1) examine phylogenetic relationships with respect to the principal Scleractinia taxa, (2) check population structure, (3) test the widespread connectivity hypothesis and (4) assess the utility of different nuclear and mitochondrial markers currently in use. To carry out these goals, DNA sequence data from nuclear (ITS and 28S) and mitochondrial (16S and COI) markers were analyzed for several coral species and for Mediterranean populations of D. dianthus. Three phylogenetic methodologies (ML, MP and BI), based on data from the four molecular markers, all supported D. dianthus as clearly belonging to the “robust” clade, in which the species Lophelia pertusa and D. dianthus not only grouped together, but also shared haplotypes for some DNA markers. Molecular results also showed shared haplotypes among D. dianthus populations distributed in regions separated by several thousands of kilometers and by clear geographic barriers. These results could reflect limited molecular and morphological taxonomic resolution rather than real widespread connectivity. Additional studies are needed in order to find molecular markers and morphological features able to disentangle the complex phylogenetic relationship in the Order Scleractinia and to differentiate isolated populations, thus avoiding the homoplasy found in some morphological characters that are still considered in the literature.© The Author(s),  2012.

Metabolomics methods for the synthetic biology of secondary metabolism
Many microbial secondary metabolites are of high biotechnological value for medicine, agriculture, and the food industry. Bacterial genome mining has revealed numerous novel secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters, which encode the potential to synthesize a large diversity of compounds that have never been observed before. The stimulation or "awakening" of this cryptic microbial secondary metabolism has naturally attracted the attention of synthetic microbiologists, who exploit recent advances in DNA sequencing and synthesis to achieve unprecedented control over metabolic pathways. One of the indispensable tools in the synthetic biology toolbox is metabolomics, the global quantification of small biomolecules. This review illustrates the pivotal role of metabolomics for the synthetic microbiology of secondary metabolism, including its crucial role in novel compound discovery in microbes, the examination of side products of engineered metabolic pathways, as well as the identification of major bottlenecks for the overproduction of compounds of interest, especially in combination with metabolic modeling. We conclude by highlighting remaining challenges and recent technological advances that will drive metabolomics towards fulfilling its potential as a cornerstone technology of synthetic microbiology. ?? 2012 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

Dissecting the determinants of light sensitivity in amphioxus microvillar photoreceptors : possible evolutionary implications for melanopsin signaling
Melanopsin, a photopigment related to the rhodopsin of microvillar photoreceptors of invertebrates, evolved in vertebrates to subserve nonvisual light-sensing functions, such as the pupillary reflex and entrainment of circadian rhythms. However, vertebrate circadian receptors display no hint of a microvillar specialization and show an extremely low light sensitivity and sluggish kinetics. Recently in amphioxus, the most basal chordate, melanopsin-expressing photoreceptors were characterized; these cells share salient properties with both rhabdomeric photoreceptors of invertebrates and circadian receptors of vertebrates. We used electrophysiology to dissect the gain of the light-transduction process in amphioxus and examine key features that help outline the evolutionary transition toward a sensor optimized to report mean ambient illumination rather than mediating spatial vision. By comparing the size of current fluctuations attributable to single photon melanopsin isomerizations with the size of single-channels activated by light, we concluded that the gain of the transduction cascade is lower than in rhabdomeric receptors. In contrast, the expression level of melanopsin (gauged by measuring charge displacements during photo-induced melanopsin isomerization) is comparable with that of canonical visual receptors. A modest amplification in melanopsin-using receptors is therefore apparent in early chordates; the decrease in photopigment expression—and loss of the anatomical correlates—observed in vertebrates subsequently enabled them to attain the low photosensitivity tailored to the role of circadian receptors.© The Author(s),  2012.

Graphene surfaces are scrutinised for topographic peculiarities, which occur naturally or have been introduced. High-angle-annular-dark-field (HAADF) and bright-field lattice images of graphene acquired in an aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), in conjunction with electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), show vacancy- and ad-atom-related point defects, as well as the presence of hydrogen. In boron implanted graphene, the edges of graphene sheets appear to be capture centres for boron atoms. Furthermore, rippling effects in the graphene sheets can be revealed by fast Fourier transform (FFT) procedures; these help visualise changes in the bond length projection arising from inclinations of the sheet.

A Case Study in Constructing Contract Compliant Software Components
In the recent few years there has been in the Software Engineering   community, a strong interest towards Component Based Software Development   (CBSD). Currently, CBSD faces lots of problems that need to be solved   before it can be widely used. A critical question is how a client can trust   a component. The answer is to provide a contract for the component and also   prove that the component is compliant with it. In this project we use   SPARK, a critical systems’ programming language, to develop two components,   provide contracts for them and prove that the components comply with the   contracts. Our aim is to check whether SPARK can be used in the   construction of contract compliant software components, and how this is   accomplished. We conclude that apart from some disadvantages, SPARK can   indeed be used in the construction of contract compliant software   components.

Depending on the supersaturation, we observed a variety of condensate morphologies consistent with those reported in clinical investigations. Remarkably, the crystallization can occur at quite low concentrations. This suggests that, even within the regular immune response to infections, cryoprecipitation of Ig can be possible.

On the need for a tunneling pre-factor in Fowler-Nordheim tunneling theory
<p>This paper argues that a tunneling prefactor should appear in expressions for the tunneling probability D relevant to cold field electron emission (CFE) and in Fowler-Nordheim (FN) type equations. Except in the case of the "ideally smooth" parabolic barrier, a prefactor is always present for barriers where D can be found by exact solution of the Schrodinger equation. A review of the Jeffreys-Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (JWKB) approach to solving the Schrodinger equation shows that tunneling barriers should be classified according to whether they are weak or strong and ideally smooth or not: there are four different JWKB-type formulas, depending on the nature of the barrier. CFE tunneling barriers are not ideally smooth but since the 1950s have usually been analyzed using the JWKB formulas for ideally smooth barriers. These analyses, and the standard Murphy-Good FN-type equation, seem mathematically and physically incomplete. The FN-type equations currently used to describe CFE should be revised to explicitly include a tunneling prefactor. Some implications are explored.</p>

Voriconazole-induced photosensitivity: photobiological assessment of a                    case series of 12 patients.
BACKGROUND: Voriconazole, a                        broad-spectrum triazole antifungal agent increasingly used to treat                        aspergillosis, has been linked with acute photosensitivity and skin                        carcinogenesis. The action spectrum of the photosensitivity is unknown,                        while an indirect retinol effect secondary to the antifungal's impact on                        CYP450 enzymes has been proposed to contribute to the underlying                        mechanism. OBJECTIVES: To perform a detailed                        photobiological assessment of the photosensitivity presenting in a series of                        12 patients treated with voriconazole. METHODS: Minimal erythemal dose                        thresholds (MED) to narrow wavebands of ultraviolet (UV) A, UVB and visible                        light were determined. Provocation testing was performed to broadband UVA                        (310-400 nm) and to solar-simulated radiation (SSR) (290-400 nm). Patients                        underwent routine photopatch testing and laboratory investigations including                        serum vitamin A (retinol). RESULTS: Patients (eight men, four                        women; median age 54years, range 40-63) experienced moderate-severe                        cutaneous erythema (n = 12), burning pain (n=5), itching (n=3), scaling                        (n=5), vesiculation (n=5) and oedema (n=1) following sunlight exposure;                        increased lentigines (n=4) and actinic cheilitis (n = 4) were also observed.                        While the majority (n=8) of patients showed normal MED thresholds to                        monochromator phototesting to UVB, UVA and visible light, a low MED to UVA                        was observed in four patients. Repeated provocation testing with broadband                        UVA and SSR provoked an abnormal erythema in eight and 10 patients,                        respectively. Serum retinol levels were mildly elevated in two patients but                        normal in the majority. CONCLUSION:  UVA sensitivity is                        the predominant finding in acute voriconazole-induced photosensitivity. We                        found little evidence of elevated circulating retinol as the causal factor.                        Patients with voriconazole-induced photosensitivity require education in                        appropriate UVA protective measures in addition to consideration of skin                        surveillance for malignant sequelae.

[kd, assay, keloid]

Long-term organ culture of keloid disease tissue.
Keloid disease (KD) is a common fibroproliferative disorder of unknown aetiopathogenesis, with highly unsatisfactory treatment. Therefore, it is crucial to have a robust and clinically relevant model for studying KD pathobiology as well as preclinical testing of potential KD therapeutics. However, the unique occurrence of KD in human skin and the corresponding lack of animal models pose a major challenge in KD research. Therefore, we developed a simplified assay for the serum-free, long-term organ culture of KD tissue that facilitates quantitative analyses of major KD read-out parameters. Four millimetre KD punches embedded in a collagen matrix and organ-cultured at the epidermis air-liquid interphase (ALI) in supplemented William's E medium showed optimal tissue, cell and RNA preservation for up to 6 weeks (as measured by H & E and Pyronin Y histochemistry as well as by MTT assay, lactate dehydrogenase release and quantitative Ki67/TUNEL immunohistomorphometry). The keloid phenotype persisted well during this period, as shown by collagen-I and -III synthesis (Herovici's histochemistry staining and ELISA), and analysis of the expression of significant KD markers (CD3, CD20, CD31, CD34, CD56, tryptase, Langerin, vimentin, neutrophil elastase, CTGF and Collagen). To functionally evaluate whether this assay can test the response to candidate therapeutics, dexamethasone, a glucocorticosteroid often used in KD therapy, was administered. Indeed, dexamethasone significantly reduced the keloid volume and cellularity plus induced epidermal shrinkage. Therefore, this novel assay provides a quantitative, clinically relevant model system for studying KD pathobiology and response to treatment.

In the absence of reactive oxygen species, T cells default to a Th1 phenotype and mediate protection against pulmonary Cryptococcus neoformans infection.
In recent years, the prevalence of invasive fungal infections has increased, attributed mostly to the rising population of immunocompromised individuals. Cryptococcus neoformans has been one of the most devastating, with an estimated 6-8% of AIDS-infected patients succumbing to Cryptococcus-associated meningitis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are potent antimicrobial agents but also play a significant role in regulating immune cell phenotype, but cause immunopathology when produced in excess. We now show that mice lacking phagocyte NADPH oxidase have heightened macrophage and Th1 responses and improved pathogen containment within pulmonary granulomatous lesions. Consequently, dissemination of this fungus to the brain is diminished, an effect that is independent of IL-12. Similar results are described using the metalloporphyrin antioxidant manganese(III) tetrakis(N-ethyl pyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, which also promoted a protective Th1 response and reduced dissemination to the brain. These findings are in sharp contrast to the protective potential of ROS against other fungal pathogens, and highlight the pivotal role that ROS can fulfill in shaping the profile of the host's immune response.

Direct x-ray detection with conjugated polymer devices
<p>The authors report the first direct detection of x-ray induced photocurrents in thick films (up to 20 mu m) of conjugated polymers. Schottky-based "sandwich" structures were fabricated from layers of either poly1-methoxy-4-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-phenylenevinylene (MEH-PPV) or poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) (PFO) on indium tin oxide substrates using a top contact of aluminum. Good rectification was achieved from the Al-polymer contact, with a reverse bias leakage current density as low as 4 nA/cm(2) at an electric field strength of 25 kV/cm. Irradiation with x-rays from a 50 kV x-ray tube produced a linear increase in photocurrent over a dose rate range from 4 to 18 mGy/s. The observed x-ray sensitivities of 240 nC/mGy/cm(3) for MEH-PPV and 480 nC/mGy/cm(3) for PFO structures are comparable to that reported for Si devices. A response time of &lt; 150 ms to pulsed x-ray irradiation was measured with no evidence of long-lived current transients. Conjugated polymers offer the advantage of easy coatability over large areas and on curved surfaces. Their low average atomic number provides tissue-equivalent dosimetric response, with many potential applications including medical x-ray and synchrotron photon detection.

[expression, skin, elastic, fibre, change, component, aged, gene, age, fold]

Differential expression of elastic fibre components in intrinsically aged skin.
Intrinsic ageing of the skin is a subtle process resulting in some degree of skin laxity. The dermal elastic fibre network imbues skin with the capacity to recoil and loss of this property contributes to an aged, wrinkled appearance. Whilst elastic fibres have a complex, composite structure which allows them to fulfil multiple roles, the effects of intrinsic ageing on their discrete molecular components has not previously been explored. In this study, we have used a microarray-based approach to perform a novel survey of the changes in gene expression that occur in components of cutaneous elastic fibres as a result of intrinsic ageing. Age-related changes in gene expression were validated at the mRNA and protein levels using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunostaining, respectively. The microarray revealed that the majority of elastic fibre network components were unchanged with age. However, three differentially expressed genes were identified: latent TGFβ-binding protein (LTBP)-2 which was up-regulated with age (fold change +1.58, P = 0.041); LTBP3 (fold change -1.67, P = 0.025) and the lysyl oxidase-like enzyme (LOXL1, fold change -1.47, P = 0.008) which were both down-regulated with age. Although the changes in gene expression for LTBP3 were not confirmed by either qPCR or immunostaining, the expression and tissue deposition of both LTBP2 and LOXL1 were significantly enhanced in intrinsically aged skin. Whilst the functional implications of these altered expression profiles remains to be elucidated, LTBP2 and LOXL1 are thought to play important roles in controlling and maintaining elastic fibre deposition, assembly and structure via binding to fibulin-5. Consequently, any age-related perturbations in the expression of these components may have important consequences on remodelling of the extracellular matrix and hence on the mechanical properties of intrinsically aged skin.

Ziprasidone and aripiprazole attenuate olanzapine-induced hyperphagia in rats.
Weight gain induced by some second-generation anti-psychotics such as olanzapine has emerged as a most debilitating side-effect. This study investigates whether co-administration with either ziprasidone or aripiprazole, which have little propensity to induce weight gain, can attenuate the hyperphagic effect of olanzapine. Female hooded-Lister rats (n=8 per group) were treated acutely with either vehicle, olanzapine (1 mg/kg), ziprasidone (1 mg/kg), aripiprazole (2 mg/kg) or olanzapine in combination with ziprasidone or aripiprazole and placed in automated locomotor activity (LMA) boxes with preweighed palatable mash. Food intake and LMA were measured for 60 min postdrug treatment. All olanzapine-treated groups demonstrated significant increases in food intake (P<0.001). This effect was attenuated following co-administration of olanzapine with either ziprasidone or aripiprazole (P<0.001), neither of which affected food intake alone. The lack of hyperphagia induced by aripiprazole and ziprasidone may reflect an inherent pharmacological mechanism preventing weight gain.

Genome-Wide Association Study and Gene Expression Analysis Identifies CD84 as a Predictor of Response to Etanercept Therapy in Rheumatoid Arthritis.
Anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF) biologic therapy is a widely used treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unknown why some RA patients fail to respond adequately to anti-TNF therapy, which limits the development of clinical biomarkers to predict response or new drugs to target refractory cases. To understand the biological basis of response to anti-TNF therapy, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of more than 2 million common variants in 2,706 RA patients from 13 different collections. Patients were treated with one of three anti-TNF medications: etanercept (n = 733), infliximab (n = 894), or adalimumab (n = 1,071). We identified a SNP (rs6427528) at the 1q23 locus that was associated with change in disease activity score (ΔDAS) in the etanercept subset of patients (P = 8×10(-8)), but not in the infliximab or adalimumab subsets (P>0.05). The SNP is predicted to disrupt transcription factor binding site motifs in the 3' UTR of an immune-related gene, CD84, and the allele associated with better response to etanercept was associated with higher CD84 gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (P = 1×10(-11) in 228 non-RA patients and P = 0.004 in 132 RA patients). Consistent with the genetic findings, higher CD84 gene expression correlated with lower cross-sectional DAS (P = 0.02, n = 210) and showed a non-significant trend for better ΔDAS in a subset of RA patients with gene expression data (n = 31, etanercept-treated). A small, multi-ethnic replication showed a non-significant trend towards an association among etanercept-treated RA patients of Portuguese ancestry (n = 139, P = 0.4), but no association among patients of Japanese ancestry (n = 151, P = 0.8). Our study demonstrates that an allele associated with response to etanercept therapy is also associated with CD84 gene expression, and further that CD84 expression correlates with disease activity. These findings support a model in which CD84 genotypes and/or expression may serve as a useful biomarker for response to etanercept treatment in RA patients of European ancestry.

ESCMID* guideline for the diagnosis and management of Candida diseases 2012: non-neutropenic adult patients.
This part of the EFISG guidelines focuses on non-neutropenic adult patients. Only a few of the numerous recommendations can be summarized in the abstract. Prophylactic usage of fluconazole is supported in patients with recent abdominal surgery and recurrent gastrointestinal perforations or anastomotic leakages. Candida isolation from respiratory secretions alone should never prompt treatment. For the targeted initial treatment of candidaemia, echinocandins are strongly recommended while liposomal amphotericin B and voriconazole are supported with moderate, and fluconazole with marginal strength. Treatment duration for candidaemia should be a minimum of 14 days after the end of candidaemia, which can be determined by one blood culture per day until negativity. Switching to oral treatment after 10 days of intravenous therapy has been safe in stable patients with susceptible Candida species. In candidaemia, removal of indwelling catheters is strongly recommended. If catheters cannot be removed, lipid-based amphotericin B or echinocandins should be preferred over azoles. Transoesophageal echocardiography and fundoscopy should be performed to detect organ involvement. Native valve endocarditis requires surgery within a week, while in prosthetic valve endocarditis, earlier surgery may be beneficial. The antifungal regimen of choice is liposomal amphotericin B +/- flucytosine. In ocular candidiasis, liposomal amphotericin B +/- flucytosine is recommended when the susceptibility of the isolate is unknown, and in susceptible isolates, fluconazole and voriconazole are alternatives. Amphotericin B deoxycholate is not recommended for any indication due to severe side effects.

Omitting elective nodal irradiation during thoracic irradiation in limited-stage small cell lung cancer--evidence from a phase II trial.
Omitting elective nodal irradiation (ENI) in limited-stage disease small cell lung cancer (LD-SCLC) is expected to result in smaller radiation fields. We report on data from a randomised phase II trial that omitted ENI in patients receiving concurrent chemo-radiotherapy for LD-SCLC. 38 patients with LD-SCLC were randomised to receive once-daily (66 Gy in 33 fractions) or twice-daily (45 Gy in 30 fractions) radiotherapy (RT). 3D-conformal RT was given concurrently with cisplatin and etoposide starting with the second cycle of a total of four cycles. The gross tumour volume was defined as primary tumour with involved lymph nodes (nodes ≥1 cm in short axis) identifiable with CT imaging. ENI was not used. Six recurrence patterns were identified: recurrence within planning target volume (PTV) only, recurrence within PTV+regional nodal recurrence and/or distant recurrence, isolated nodal recurrence outside PTV, nodal recurrence outside PTV+distant recurrence, distant metastases only and no recurrence. At median follow-up 16.9 months, 31/38 patients were evaluable and 14/31 patients had relapsed. There were no isolated nodal recurrences. Eight patients relapsed with intra-thoracic disease: 2 within PTV only, 4 within PTV and distantly and 2 with nodal recurrence outside PTV plus distant metastases. Rates of grade 3+ acute oesophagitis and pneumonitis in the 31 evaluable patients were 23 and 3% respectively. In our study of LD-SCLC, omitting ENI based on CT imaging was not associated with a high risk of isolated nodal recurrence, although further prospective studies are needed to confirm this. Routine ENI omission will be further evaluated prospectively in the ongoing phase III CONVERT trial (NCT00433563).

[susceptibility, diabetes, genetic, locus, t2d, type, variant, analysis, association, architecture]

Large-scale association analysis provides insights into the genetic architecture and pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes.
To extend understanding of the genetic architecture and molecular basis of type 2 diabetes (T2D), we conducted a meta-analysis of genetic variants on the Metabochip, including 34,840 cases and 114,981 controls, overwhelmingly of European descent. We identified ten previously unreported T2D susceptibility loci, including two showing sex-differentiated association. Genome-wide analyses of these data are consistent with a long tail of additional common variant loci explaining much of the variation in susceptibility to T2D. Exploration of the enlarged set of susceptibility loci implicates several processes, including CREBBP-related transcription, adipocytokine signaling and cell cycle regulation, in diabetes pathogenesis.

[versican, vg1, hyaluronan, binding, disease, interaction, function]

Structural and Functional Studies on the G1 Domain of Human Versican
The chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan (CSPG) versican forms complexes with hyaluronan (HA), which are essential in a range of functions including cellular proliferation and migration. Four isoforms of versican result from alternative splicing. Furthermore, biological roles have been identified for the proteolytic cleavage product of versican which contains the N-terminal G1 hyaluronan binding domain. All of these versican forms have different tightly regulated tissue expression profiles. Consequently, impaired regulation is associated with a number of disease pathologies. For example the largest variants (V0/V1) have been shown to be negative indicators of disease outcome in a number of malignant cancers and are a marker of disease progression in atherosclerosis. Interestingly, the smaller versican isoform V3 which lacks CS chains has been demonstrated to have the potential to reverse disease associated phenotypes. The motivation for carrying out the work in this thesis was to try and gain a better understanding of how versican functions on a molecular scale. In this regard, the first aim was to investigate the structure of the hyaluronan binding region of versican using a construct called VG1. The structure of VG1 was analysed in the presence and absence of hyaluronan oligomers. This revealed an insight into the multi-modular structure of the versican hyaluronan binding region and demonstrated that on binding to HA, VG1 under goes a conformational change. Furthermore, the interaction between VG1 and longer lengths of hyaluronan (pHA) was investigated. This demonstrated that when VG1 binds to pHA it is does so with positive cooperativity, packing very close to neighbouring VG1 molecules along a chain of HA. One consequence of this interaction was to reorganise pHA into a helical conformation, an organisation that was confirmed by a number of solution phase techniques. The effect of this reorganisation of pHA by VG1 on HA/CD44 interactions was also assessed. Previously the interaction between CD44 (a cell surface hyaluronan receptor) and long chains of HA (>30 kDa) was shown to be irreversible; however we demonstrate that VG1 can reverse this. Furthermore, a TSG-6 enhanced CD44/interaction was also completely reversed by the addition of VG1.  This provides an indication that a functional hierarchy of hyaluronan binding proteins may exist which could have important implications in understanding the function of hyaluronan complexes.Currently, we do not know whether intact versican molecules could interact with HA in the same way as VG1. However, preliminary data suggests that the CS-containing variants (i.e. V0, V1 and V2) would not, whereas V3 and versican fragments could. This work provides an exciting mechanistic insight into the function of versican variants and their breakdown products.

[mammary, cav-3, mouse, tumor, lactogenic, cell, microenvironment, expression, gland, formation]

Loss of caveolin-3 induces a lactogenic microenvironment that is protective against mammary tumor formation.
Here, we show that functional loss of a single gene is sufficient to confer constitutive milk protein production and protection against mammary tumor formation. Caveolin-3 (Cav-3), a muscle-specific caveolin-related gene, is highly expressed in muscle cells. We demonstrate that Cav-3 is also expressed in myoepithelial cells within the mammary gland. To determine whether genetic ablation of Cav-3 expression affects adult mammary gland development, we studied the phenotype(s) of Cav-3(-/-)-null mice. Interestingly, Cav-3(-/-) virgin mammary glands developed lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia, akin to the changes normally observed during pregnancy and lactation. Genome-wide expression profiling revealed up-regulation of gene transcripts associated with pregnancy/lactation, mammary stem cells, and human breast cancers, consistent with a constitutive lactogenic phenotype. Expression levels of three key transcriptional regulators of lactation, namely Elf5, Stat5a, and c-Myc, were also significantly elevated. Experiments with pregnant mice directly showed that Cav-3(-/-) mice underwent precocious lactation. Finally, using orthotopic tumor cell implantation, we demonstrated that virgin Cav-3(-/-) mice were dramatically protected against mammary tumor formation. Thus, Cav-3(-/-) mice are a novel preclinical model to study the protective effects of a lactogenic microenvironment on mammary tumor onset and progression. Our current studies have broad implications for using the lactogenic microenvironment as a paradigm to discover new therapies for the prevention and/or treatment of human breast cancers.

The class I MHC homologue of human cytomegalovirus inhibits attack by natural killer cells.
Recognition and destruction of virus-infected cells by class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) is a central part of the immune system's attempts to control and eliminate virus infection. It is therefore not surprising that many viruses have evolved strategies to interfere with the processing and presentation of peptide antigen on class I MHC molecules (reviewed in ref. 1). These mechanisms act to prevent or reduce expression of MHC molecules at the cell surface. However, many natural killer (NK) cells are able to recognize and destroy host cells that no longer express class I MHC molecules (the 'missing self' hypothesis). Thus, any virus-infected cell that has lost cell-surface expression of MHC class I to avoid CTL attack should become susceptible to NK-cell-mediated destruction. We describe here the first example, to our knowledge, of a viral strategy to evade immune surveillance by NK cells.

[hlh, protein, 1r21, human, cell]

An immediate early human gene encodes an Id-like helix-loop-helix protein and is regulated by protein kinase C activation in diverse cell types.
Transcription factors characterized by the presence of a helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain play a central role in the regulation of cell growth/differentiation and tumorigenesis. We report here the cDNA sequence of a human early-response gene, designated HLH 1R21, encoding a 15-kDa HLH protein that lacks a basic, DNA-binding domain and which by a number of criteria appears to be the human homologue of mouse HLH 462. Like its murine counterpart, HLH 1R21 protein functions as an Id (inhibitor of DNA binding) transcription factor by inhibiting the binding of E2A-containing protein complexes to muscle creatine kinase E-box enhancer oligonucleotide in vitro. However HLH 1R21 does not inhibit the binding of HLH Max protein to a Max-binding oligonucleotide in vitro, indicating that it has limited promiscuity in its ability to antagonize the function of other HLH transcription factors. In addition, HLH 1R21 mRNA transcripts are regulated by phorbol ester treatment of a diverse range of human cell lines and, when overexpressed in mouse NIH3T3 cells, HLH 1R21 induces a morphologically transformed phenotype.

<p>We investigate the effects of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) on poly (3-hexylthiophene): phenyl-C61- butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) based organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices by inserting thermally evaporated PTFE films between indium-tin-oxide (ITO) and P3HT: PCBM layers. Significant improvement in terms of open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, and thereby in its commensurate power conversion efficiency is achieved compared to devices with poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly (styrene-sulfonate) layers. The OPVs performance enhancement is attributed to the formation of an artificial dipole layer resulting from the rich, negatively charged fluorine that facilitates the hole extraction process. This result shows the high potential of PTFE as a low cost and stable ITO buffer layer for OPV devices</p>

Revisiting 'What works for whom?'  A qualitative framework for evaluating clinical effectiveness in child psychotherapy
This paper describes a framework for evaluating the effectiveness of child psychotherapy used by child psychotherapists in an inner city Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS). The Hopes and Expectations for Treatment Approach (HETA) involves using the assessment for psychotherapy that normally precedes treatment to derive a baseline from which to generate a set of hopes/expectations as regards the effects of the treatment on the part of parents and the psychotherapist, to be revisited one year after the start of the psychotherapy and/or at its completion. The Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire, for parents and schools, was also administered before and after the treatment. The characteristics of the first 30 children referred for psychotherapy over a particular time period are described. Of the first 15 children in this group to complete one year of individual psychotherapy, all showed change or significant change in the areas concerning parents' and therapists' hopes at the end-of-year review, as rated by parents and psychotherapists. A case of a child with conduct disorder is used to describe how the assessment generated a psychoanalytic formulation, how the therapist's understanding was fed back to the parents, and how the parents' and therapist's hopes and expectations were derived and recorded. This case illustrates powerfully the impact of trauma in the parents' backgrounds on the internal world of the child, and how the method provides a useful bridge between parent and child work. Feedback from the psychotherapists, the parents and the referrers using the framework is reviewed, and in conclusion the paper argues for the framework's value in promoting good practice in the treatment and management of complex cases and in enhancing awareness of the nature and scope of the psychotherapy process.

Antibody to the gastric campylobacter-like organism ("Campylobacter pyloridis")--clinical correlations and distribution in the normal population.
Different cellular proteins of the gastric campylobacter-like organism (GCLO) were shown to be immunogenic for man. Antibodies to GCLO were detected in sera by both complement fixation and enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. Antibody was found in 133 (52%) of 254 patients attending for gastroscopy. There was a high correlation between presence of antibody and a positive GCLO culture from the gastric mucus. Patients with normal endoscopic appearances, duodenal ulcer, duodenitis and oesophagitis had similar prevalences (c. 50%) of antibody. Only patients with endoscopically visible gastritis or gastric ulcer had a higher frequency (c. 80%) of antibody. In a normal population, antibody was uncommon in individuals less than 20 years old, but the prevalence of antibody increased (to c. 50%) with age. There was little evidence to support an important pathological role for GCLO in disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract, although the possibility that it may be a co-factor in the pathogenesis of gastric ulcer cannot be excluded.

Disruption of the interaction between PMCA2 and calcineurin triggers apoptosis and enhances paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells.
Cancer is caused by defects in the signalling mechanisms that govern cell proliferation and apoptosis. It is well known that calcium-dependent signalling pathways play a critical role in cell regulation. A tight control of calcium homeostasis by transporters and channel proteins is required to assure a proper functioning of the calcium-sensitive signal transduction pathways that regulate cell growth and apoptosis. The plasma membrane calcium ATPase 2 (PMCA2) has been recently identified as a negative regulator of apoptosis that can play a significant role in cancer progression by conferring cells resistance to apoptosis. We have previously reported an inhibitory interaction between PMCA2 and the calcium-activated signalling molecule calcineurin in breast cancer cells. Here, we demonstrate that disruption of the PMCA2/calcineurin interaction in a variety of human breast cancer cells results in activation of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway, upregulation in the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Fas Ligand and in a concomitant loss of cell viability. Reduction in cell viability is the consequence of an increase in cell apoptosis. Impairment of the PMCA2/calcineurin interaction enhances paclitaxel-mediated cytotoxicity of breast tumoral cells. Our results suggest that therapeutic modulation of the PMCA2/calcineurin interaction might have important clinical applications to improve current treatments for breast cancer patients.

Randomised controlled trial of effect on quality of life of prescription of second generation (atypical) versus first generation antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia Abstract. 20th International Congress on Schizophrenia Research, Savannah, Georgia, US.
Objectives: To compare the class of conventional, first generation antipsychotic drugs (FGA) with the atypical, second generation drugs (SGA) other than Clozapine, in people with schizophrenia needing a change in treatment because of poor response or side effects. We hypothesized that SGA drugs would be associated with improvement in health-related quality of life. Design: A five-centre,RCT with three, blinded follow-up assessments over one year. The trial was conducted in general adult mental health settings in 14 NHS Trusts in Greater Manchester, Nottingham, Cambridge and London.Participants: 227 participants age 18-65 with schizophrenia and related disorders. Intervention: Random allocation to prescription from the class of SGA drugs, other than Clozapine, available at the time of the trial (Amisulpride, Olanzapine, Quetiapine, Risperidone) or to an FGA drug; choice of drug from within the randomised class was made by the managing clinician. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was the Quality of Life Scale (QLS). Secondary outcomes included symptoms (PANSS), side effects and participant satisfaction. Results: The primary hypothesis of a five point improvement in QLS over the year following commencement of SGA compared with FGA drugs was excluded by an intention to treat analysis. Participants in the FGA arm showed a trend towardsgreater improvements in QLS and symptoms scores, suggesting failure to find the predicted advantage for SGA drugs was unlikely to be due to low statistical power (75%). Participants reported no clear preference for either class of drug. Conclusion: In people with schizophrenia whose medication is being changed because of intolerance or broadly-defined ineffectiveness, there is no disadvantage over one year in terms of quality of life, symptoms or associated costs of care in commencing conventional FGA drugs rather than atypical SGA drugs. This result is not accounted for by inadequate power or by patterns of drug discontinuation.

Fermi -LAT constraints on the pulsar wind nebula nature of HESS J1857+026
Context. Since its launch, the Fermi satellite has firmly identified 5 pulsar wind nebulae plus a large number of candidates, all powered by young and energetic pulsars. HESS J1857 + 026 is a spatially extended $\gamma$-ray source detected by H.E.S.S. and classified as a possible pulsar wind nebula candidate powered by PSR J1856 + 0245. Aims: We search for $\gamma$-ray pulsations from PSR J1856+0245 and explore the characteristics of its associated pulsar wind nebula. Methods: Using a rotational ephemeris obtained from the Lovell telescope at Jodrell Bank Observatory at 1.5 GHz, we phase-fold 36 months of $\gamma$-ray data acquired by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) aboard Fermi. We also perform a complete $\gamma$-ray spectral and morphological analysis. Results: No $\gamma$-ray pulsations were detected from PSR J1856+0245. However, significant emission is detected at a position coincident with the TeV source HESS J1857 + 026. The $\gamma$-ray spectrum is well described by a simple power-law with a spectral index of $\Gamma$ = 1.53 ?? 0.11stat ?? 0.55syst and an energy flux of G(0.1-100 GeV) = (2.71 ?? 0.52stat ?? 1.51syst) ?? 10-11 erg cm-2 s-1. The $\gamma$-ray luminosity is LPWN$\gamma$ (0.1-100 GeV)=(2.5 ?? 0.5stat ?? 1.5syst) ?? 1035 (d/9 kpc)2 erg s-1, assuming a distance of 9 kpc. This implies a $\gamma$-ray efficiency of \ {}5\% for ?? = 4.6 ?? 1036 erg s-1, in the range expected for pulsar wind nebulae.

One hundred patients with tracheobronchial tumours were treated with the neodymium YAG (yttrium-aluminium-garnet) or argon laser for symptoms of airways obstruction caused by tumour (59 cases), complete collapse of a lung (17 cases), or recurrent haemoptysis (24 cases). Seventy four of them had relapsed or failed to respond to radiotherapy or chemotherapy and all were inoperable. Objective improvement in results of lung function tests or haemoptysis diary charts was seen in 37 patients with airways obstruction (63%), five (29%) with collapsed lung, and 14 (58%) with haemoptysis. Overall, 68 patients had symptomatic benefit and there was objective improvement in 56. Two deaths occurred in 288 treatment sessions both occurring as a result of asphyxia from minor haemorrhage in patients with advanced cylindromas and critical narrowing of the trachea or single remaining bronchus. In suitable patients with intraluminal tumour laser phototherapy is a valuable addition to conventional treatment.

Cyclic Mechanical Reinforcement of Integrin-Ligand Interactions.
Cells regulate adhesion in response to internally generated and externally applied forces. Integrins connect the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton and provide cells with mechanical anchorages and signaling platforms. Here we show that cyclic forces applied to a fibronectin-integrin α(5)β(1) bond switch the bond from a short-lived state with 1 s lifetime to a long-lived state with 100 s lifetime. We term this phenomenon "cyclic mechanical reinforcement," as the bond strength remembers the history of force application and accumulates over repeated cycles, but does not require force to be sustained. Cyclic mechanical reinforcement strengthens the fibronectin-integrin α(5)β(1) bond through the RGD binding site of the ligand with the synergy binding site greatly facilitating the process. A flexible integrin hybrid domain is also important for cyclic mechanical reinforcement. Our results reveal a mechanical regulation of receptor-ligand interactions and identify a molecular mechanism for cell adhesion strengthening by cyclic forces.

Polarization observables and spin-dependent distortion effects in single-nucleon knockout reactions
<p>A formalism is developed and predictions are made for selected polarization observables in one-nucleon knockout reactions within the transfer-to-the-continuum direct reaction model. The effects of nucleon-target spin-orbit distortions are also included and their importance is quantified. The calculated knockout reaction analyzing powers reach an appreciable fraction of their maximum allowed values. They are also found to be quite sensitive to the different approximation schemes used for the transfer probability amplitude within the transfer-to-the-continuum model. In contrast, they are shown to be insensitive to details of the two-body interactions assumed, including the nucleon-target spin-orbit interaction. The angular distributions of gamma-rays, arising from the decay of heavy reaction residues produced in excited final states, are shown to be strongly anisotropic.</p>

Exploring the spectroscopic differences of Caki-2 cells progressing through the cell cycle while proliferating in-vitro
FTIR micro-spectral images of Caki-2 cells cytospun onto calcium fluoride (CaF2) slides were used to build a computational model in order to discriminate between the biochemical events of the continuous cell cycle during proliferation. Multivariate analysis and machine learning techniques such as PCA, PLSR and SVMs were used to highlight the chemical differences among the cell cycle phases and also to point out the need for removing the distortion of the spectra due to the morphology of the cells. Results showed cell cycle dependant scattering profiles that enabled the training of a SVM in order to recognise, with a relative high accuracy, each cell cycle phase purely with the scattering curve removed from the FTIR data after being subject to the RMieS-EMSC algorithm.

Genetic variation in vascular endothelial growth factor-a and lung function.
RATIONALE: Given the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in lung development, we hypothesized that polymorphisms in VEGF-A may be associated with lung function. OBJECTIVES: The current study was designed to assess the role of genetic variants in VEGF-A as determinants of airway function from infancy through early adulthood. METHODS: Association between five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VEGF-A and lung function were assessed longitudinally in two unselected birth cohorts and cross-sectionally among infants. Replication with two SNPs was conducted in adults and children with asthma. We investigated the functionality of the SNP most consistently associated with lung function (rs3025028) using Western blotting to measure the ratio of plasma VEGF-A(165b)/panVEGF-A(165) among homozygotes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In two populations in infancy, C-allele homozygotes of rs3025028 had significantly higher VmaxFRC, forced expiratory flow(50), and forced expiratory flow(25-75) compared with other genotype groups. Among preschool children (age 3 yr), C allele of rs3025028 was associated with significantly higher specific airway conductance, with similar findings observed for lung function in school-age children. For FEV(1)/FVC ratio similar findings were observed among adolescents and young adults (birth cohort), and then replicated in adults and schoolchildren with asthma (cross-sectional studies). For rs3025038, plasma VEGF-A(165b)/panVEGF-A(165) was significantly higher among CC versus GG homozygotes (P ≤ 0.02) at birth, in school-age children, and in adults. CONCLUSIONS: We report significant associations between VEGF-A SNP rs3025028 and parameters of airway function measured throughout childhood, with the effect persisting into adulthood. We propose that the mechanism may be mediated through the ratios of active and inhibitory isoforms of VEGF-A(165), which may be determined by alternative splicing.

A Metacognitive Perspective on Somatic Symptom Reporting
ABSTRACT OF THESISA metacognitive perspective on somatic symptom reporting.Philip Benedict MilnerDoctor of Clinical Psychology, The University of ManchesterJune 2012	The first part of this thesis explores the potential role of metacognitive beliefs and strategies in functional somatic symptoms.  Current models (for example, Brown, 2004; Deary, Chalder and Sharpe, 2007) and treatments of functional somatic symptoms focus on cognitive models and cognitive behavioural treatments which show modest treatment effects.  A metacognitive account is discussed based upon supervisory regulatory executive function theory (SREF; Wells and Matthews, 1994) and research is systematically reviewed which may support such an account.  Current research offers limited indirect support for metacognitive factors playing a role in the difficulties of people suffering from functional somatic symptoms.  This paper concludes that further research is needed in this promising area.	The second part of the thesis describes a cross-sectional correlational study which examines the relationship of somatic symptom reporting in primary care with metacognitive beliefs, finding a significant association for the first time.  Fifty patients were recruited from general practice surgeries took part in the study.  Support for the novel Metacognitive Health Questionnaire measure was also found.  This measure showed significant associations between health specific metacognitive beliefs and body focussed attention, health preoccupation and distress.  This measure also showed significant associations with illness behaviours and thought control strategies.  Each of these findings is in line with SREF theory.  This study provides preliminary support for the role of metacognition in symptom reporting.	The third part of the thesis critically evaluated issues salient to the study including methodologically, supervisory, ethical and clinical issues.  The interpretations of the literature review and findings of the research paper are limited by the lack of direct findings to support a metacognitive account, and the cross sectional nature of this study.  It is hoped that the prospective study which the research study reported forms part, will offer more robust insights into the role of metacognition in symptom reporting, and that future studies will examine this area further.

The association of cardiac ventricular hypertrophy with Congenital Hyperinsulinism (CHI).
ABSTRACT: Objective: Ventricular hypertrophy (VH) has been observed in children with Congenital Hyperinsulinism (CHI), a condition of hypoglycaemia characterised by dysregulated insulin secretion, but the prevalence is not known. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cardiac assessment was performed in children (n=49) with CHI at diagnosis and follow-up. Two dimensional and Doppler echocardiography studies were used to assess cardiac structures, while M-mode study was used to measure left ventricular (LV) dimensions, subsequently converted to Z scores. Where possible, LVH was confirmed by LV mass index (LVMI, g/m2.7) > 95th centile. RESULTS: Cardiac structural lesions were found in 14 (28%) children. At initial echocardiography, VH was present in 31 (65%) children with median (range) left ventricular posterior wall dimension in diastole (LVPWd) Z scores of + 1.6 (-2.4 to +5.8) and interventricular septal dimension in diastole (IVSd) Z scores of +1.9 (-1.7 to +17.2). At follow up echocardiography, performed after an interval of 178 (45 to 390) days, VH persisted in 16 (33%) children. In regression analysis, the presence of VH odds ratio (95% confidence intervals (CI)) 1.1 (1.0 to 1.2), p=0.04 at initial echocardiography was correlated with maximum glucose requirement at diagnosis, indicating that severity of CHI at presentation may play a role in the pathogenesis of VH. CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of children with CHI have cardiac structural lesions. A majority also have VH, which may be associated with the severity of CHI at diagnosis. VH may persist in some children, which requires careful long term cardiac review.Word count 245.

Does routine abdominal ultrasound enhance diagnostic accuracy in irritable bowel syndrome?
OBJECTIVE: The current recommendation that irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) should be diagnosed positively using minimum investigation raises the possibility that some disorders, particularly gynecological, may be overlooked. Transabdominal ultrasound is now sufficiently sophisticated to allow assessment of all abdominal viscera for associated pathology, and this study was designed to evaluate its role in the diagnosis of IBS. METHODS: An ultrasound scan was performed in 125 patients (100 females, 25 males) for whom a confident diagnosis of IBS had been made. RESULTS: No serious intra-abdominal pathology was encountered, but 20% of females and 8% of males had an ultrasound abnormality. None of these abnormalities resulted in any additional therapeutic measures. A hepatobiliary abnormality was found in similar proportions of males and females (10 vs 8%). Gallstones were most common (5 vs 4%), but in no individual were they considered to entirely account for the presenting symptoms. Eight percent of the women were found to have a pelvic abnormality, but it was not regarded as serious in any of them. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that a positive approach to diagnosing IBS is a safe policy. Furthermore, routine ultrasound scanning in IBS is unnecessary and could be counter-productive by detecting many minor abnormalities, which can pose further therapeutic dilemmas.

Mapping local structural perturbations in the native state of stefin B (cystatin B) under amyloid forming conditions.
Unlike a number of amyloid-forming proteins, stefins, and in particular stefin B (cystatin B) form amyloids under conditions where the native state predominates. In order to trigger oligomerization processes, the stability of the protein needs to be compromised, favoring structural re-arrangement however, accelerating fibril formation is not a simple function of protein stability. We report here on how optimal conditions for amyloid formation lead to the destabilization of dimeric and tetrameric states of the protein in favor of the monomer. Small, highly localized structural changes can be mapped out that allow us to visualize directly areas of the protein which eventually become responsible for triggering amyloid formation. These regions of the protein overlap with the Cu (II)-binding sites which we identify here for the first time. We hypothesize that in vivo modulators of amyloid formation may act similarly to painstakingly optimized solvent conditions developed in vitro. We discuss these data in the light of current structural models of stefin B amyloid fibrils based on H-exchange data, where the detachment of the helical part and the extension of loops were observed.

THE ANTI-ULCER EFFECT OF ETHANOL AND AQUEOUS EXTRACT OF BARK OF ALCHORNEA CORDIFOLIA ON INDOMETHACIN INDUCED ULCER IN ADULT WISTER RATS
Gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding are the most common complication of chronic use of the Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), accounting for 200 million to 400 million hospitalizations per year in places like the US. Preventing these complications is a major challenge confronting clinicians as well as researchers, who not only ensures the safety of use of the drug, but also explores the use of herbs to treat resulting complications from the use of NSAIDs.&nbsp; This study evaluates the anti-ulcer effect of ethanol and aqueous bark extract of Alchonea cordifolia on indomethacin induced ulcer, using adult Wistar rats.&nbsp; Thirty healthy adult albino rats of Wistar strain, weighing between 130 - 180 grams were randomly divided into 6 groups of 5 rats each.&nbsp; While animals in group 1 and 2 served as positive and negative controls and received distilled water and Ranitidine&reg; respectively, the animals in group 3, 4 and groups 5, 6 were administered 300mg/kg and 500mg/kg of ethanol and aqueous bark extract of Alchonea cordifolia respectively.&nbsp; Animals were sacrificed and their stomachs were removed and were macroscopically and microscopically inspected.&nbsp; Ulcer index were determined and data were subjected to one-way ANOVA, followed by Turkey's multiple comparison post hoc tests, when necessary.&nbsp; The result showed that both bark extracts significantly reduced the ulcer index (p&lt;0.05).&nbsp; The result further revealed that of the different doses of Alchonea cordifolia administered, the 500mg/kg aqueous bark extract had a more significant(1.00&plusmn;0.63) (p&lt;0.05) anti-ulcer effect compared to the 500mg/kg ethanol bark extract (2.80&plusmn;0.86) and even Ranitidine&reg; (2.40&plusmn;1.32).The present findings show that, Alchonea cordifolia has gastro-protective effect on indomethacin-induced ulcer in animal model. &nbsp; KEYWORDS: Anti-Ulcer Effect, Alchonea Cordifolia, Indomethacin-Induced Ulcer

The NF2 tumor suppressor regulates microtubule-based vesicle trafficking via a novel Rac, MLK and p38SAPK pathway
Neurofibromatosis type 2 patients develop schwannomas, meningiomas and ependymomas resulting from mutations in the tumor suppressor gene, NF2, encoding a membrane-cytoskeleton adapter protein called merlin. Merlin regulates contact inhibition of growth and controls the availability of growth factor receptors at the cell surface. We tested if microtubule-based vesicular trafficking might be a mechanism by which merlin acts. We found that schwannoma cells, containing merlin mutations and constitutive activation of the Rho/Rac family of GTPases, had decreased intracellular vesicular trafficking relative to normal human Schwann cells. In Nf2−/− mouse Schwann (SC4) cells, re-expression of merlin as well as inhibition of Rac or its effector kinases, MLK and p38SAPK, each increased the velocity of Rab6 positive exocytic vesicles. Conversely, an activated Rac mutant decreased Rab6 vesicle velocity. Vesicle motility assays in isolated squid axoplasm further demonstrated that both mutant merlin and active Rac specifically reduce anterograde microtubule-based transport of vesicles dependent upon the activity of p38SAPK kinase. Taken together, our data suggest loss of merlin results in the Rac-dependent decrease of anterograde trafficking of exocytic vesicles, representing a possible mechanism controlling the concentration of growth factor receptors at the cell surface.© Macmillan Publishers,  2013.

BAG-1: a multifunctional regulator of cell growth and survival.
BAG-1 is multifunctional protein which interacts with a wide range of cellular targets to regulate growth control pathways important for normal and malignant cells, including apoptosis, signaling, proliferation, transcription and cell motility. Of particular relevance to tumour cells, BAG-1 interacts with the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein, various nuclear hormone receptors and the 70 kDa heat shock proteins, Hsc70 and Hsp70. Interaction with chaperones may account for many of the pleiotropic effects associated with BAG-1 overexpression. Recent studies have shown that BAG-1 expression is frequently altered in malignant cells, and BAG-1 expression may have clinical value as a prognostic/predictive marker. This review summarises current understanding of molecular mechanisms of BAG-1 expression and function.

Targets for maximum waiting times and patient prioritization: Evidence from England
Waiting times are of central importance to satisfaction with publicly-funded health care. We explore how the implementation of progressively tight and stringently enforced waiting times targets over the period 2000–2008 in the English NHS and their subsequent relaxing in 2010 affected patient prioritisation for planned treatment. We adopt the Conditional Density Estimation approach to analyse how hospitals respond to waiting time targets and whether the relative ordering of patients is preserved. Our results show that one of the mechanisms for meeting the target is reducing the waiting times for long-waiting patients at the expense
of short-waiting patients. We detect statistically significant changes in prioritisation between different groups of patients. A simple explanation for the observed prioritisation patterns based on well-established queuing and scheduling concepts is provided.

Role of neuropathy and plasma nitric oxide in recurrent neuropathic and neuroischemic diabetic foot ulcers.
Various factors are associated with foot ulceration, including delayed reporting of ulcers, poor glycemic control, and severity of neuropathy. Several studies have looked at the role of nitric oxide in wound healing. However, no studies have examined its role in the occurrence and recurrence of diabetic foot ulceration. In a cross-sectional study we examined the role of neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, and plasma nitric oxide (estimated from plasma nitrite and nitrate) levels in diabetic patients with recurrent and non-recurrent neuropathic and neuroischemic foot ulcers. Patients with recurrent foot ulcers had higher vibration perception threshold values compared to patients with non-recurrent foot ulcers (47.4 +/- 5.7 volts versus 39.5 +/- 10.3 volts respectively, P < 0.05). In addition, subjects with recurrent foot ulcers had significantly higher plasma nitric oxide compared to subjects with non-recurrent foot ulcers (46.9 +/- 6.3 microm/L versus 30.2 +/- 2.4 microm/L respectively, P < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, hemoglobin A1c, presence of retinopathy and nephropathy, vibration perception threshold, plasma creatinine, and total nitric oxide, indicated that only vibration perception threshold was independently associated with the presence of an ulcer odds ratio: 1.26 (1.10-1.46); P <0.001) and the recurrence of foot ulcers odds ratio: 1.13 (1.01-1.27); P =0.04). This study has shown that although plasma nitric oxide is higher in patients with recurrent neuropathic and neuroischemic foot ulcers, severity of neuropathy was the most important factor associated with the development and recurrence of foot ulcers in diabetic patients.

ADAP-SLP-76 binding differentially regulates supramolecular activation cluster (SMAC) formation relative to T cell-APC conjugation.
T cell-APC conjugation as mediated by leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1)-intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 binding is followed by formation of the supramolecular activation cluster (SMAC) at the immunological synapse. The intracellular processes that regulate SMAC formation and its influence on T cell function are important questions to be addressed. Here, using a mutational approach, we demonstrate that binding of adaptor adhesion and degranulation promoting adaptor protein (ADAP) to SLP-76 differentially regulates peripheral SMAC (pSMAC) formation relative to conjugation. Although mutation of the YDDV sites (termed M12) disrupted SLP-76 SH2 domain binding and prevented the ability of ADAP to increase conjugation and LFA-1 clustering, M12 acted selectively as a dominant negative (DN) inhibitor of pSMAC formation, an effect that was paralleled by a DN effect on interleukin-2 production. ADAP also colocalized with LFA-1 at the immunological synapse. Our findings identify ADAP-SLP-76 binding as a signaling event that differentially regulates SMAC formation, and support a role for SMAC formation in T cell cytokine production.

Delivering early care in diabetes evaluation (DECIDE): a protocol for a randomised controlled trial to assess hospital versus home management at diagnosis in childhood diabetes.
BACKGROUND: There is increased incidence of new cases of type 1 diabetes in children younger than 15 years. The debate concerning where best to manage newly diagnosed children continues. Some units routinely admit children to hospital whilst others routinely manage children at home. A Cochrane review identified the need for a large well-designed randomised controlled trial to investigate any significant differences in comprehensive short and long-term outcomes between the two approaches. The DECIDE study will address these knowledge gaps, providing high quality evidence to inform national and international policy and practice. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a multi-centre randomised controlled trial across eight UK paediatric diabetes centres. The study aims to recruit 240 children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and their parents/carers. Eligible patients (aged 0-17 years) will be remotely randomised to either 'hospital' or 'home' management. Parents/carers of patients will also be recruited. Nursing management of participants and data collection will be co-ordinated by a project nurse at each centre. Data will be collected for 24 months after diagnosis; at follow up appointments at 3, 12 and 24 months and every 3-4 months at routine clinic visits.The primary outcome measure is patients' glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) at 24 months after diagnosis. Additional measurements of HbA1c will be made at diagnosis and 3 and 12 months later. HbA1c concentrations will be analysed at a central laboratory.Secondary outcome measures include length of stay at diagnosis, growth, adverse events, quality of life, anxiety, coping with diabetes, diabetes knowledge, home/clinic visits, self-care activity, satisfaction and time off school/work. Questionnaires will be sent to participants at 1, 12 and 24 months and will include a questionnaire, developed and validated to measure impact of the diagnosis on social activity and independence. Additional qualitative outcome measures include the experience of both approaches by a subgroup of participants (n = 30) and health professionals. Total health service costs will be evaluated. A cost effectiveness analysis will assess direct and indirect health service costs against the primary outcome (HbA1c). DISCUSSION: This will be the first randomised controlled trial to evaluate hospital and home management of children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and the findings should provide important evidence to inform practice and national guidelines.

Tunable and sensitive biophotonic waveguides based on photonic-bandgap microcavities
<p>This paper presents a theoretical study of the single-mode and birefriengence condition of the silicon photonic wires using the imaginary distance beam propagation method. The photonic wires are suitable for integration with active one-dimensional silicon photonic bandgap waveguides. This inherently will reduce the propagation loss caused by the scattering factors within the photonic bandgap structure itself. To the best of our knowledge, we provide for the first time, a systematic study of the various physical parameters that can affect the Q-factor and transmission properties in such waveguides. In order to make this technology viable, the waveguides must be tunable, have low attenuation, possess high Q-factor, and can be switched. Can these be achieved simultaneously without changing the device width and height dimensions? Furthermore, can we meet these aims without placing unrealistic demands in fabrication? The electrical switching of this device is implemented using a p-i-n optical diode. The diode is predicted to require an ON state power of 81 nW with rise and fall times of 0.2 and 0.043 ns, respectively. The length of the microcavity and the diameter of the air holes are finely tuned with reference to the Q-factor and transmission. It will be shown that for certain desired resonant wavelength, the Q-factor and transmission properties can be optimized by tuning the length of the cavity and the diameter of the two inner most air holes. This method allows ease of fabrication by not having to vary the waveguide width and height to obtain the tuning effects. Optical simulation was performed using the three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain simulation method.</p>

Effects of different chloride ion concentrations on corrosion of mild steel in aerated environment
The corrosion of mild steel in aerated solutions containing different chloride concentrations (0.0585, 0.3, 3.5, 5.85, and 10% NaCl) has been investigated using different electrochemical techniques such as linear polarisation resistance (LPR), potentiodynamic polarisation (PDP), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The three techniques gave similar results that explained the combined effects of both oxygen and chloride ions in determining the mechanism and kinetics of corrosion of mild steel. Both potentiodynamic polarisation and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy confirmed that increase in chloride concentration increases the electrical conductivity of the solution which has direct impact on the corrosion rate of the mild steel. The results obtained with linear polarisation resistance showed an increase in corrosion rate as the chloride ions concentration increase up to the threshold chloride concentration of 3.5% NaCl with corrosion rate of 0.24mmpy which is marginally higher compared to 0.189 and 0.181mmpy for potentiodynamic polarisation and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy respectively but there corrosion rate follow the same trend, and decrease with further increase in chloride concentration. Since the rate-determining step for the electrochemical reaction (corrosion) is oxygen reduction as the cathodic reaction, it was established that there was decrease in oxygen solubility at higher chloride concentrations that resulted in low corrosion rate. This is important in understanding how the chemistry of seawater environments and the condensates, which may be formed on mild steel, affect its corrosion resistance, so as to determine the amount of corrosion inhibitors to be injected to protect the steel in chloride environment.

A second gene for peroxisomal HMG-CoA reductase? A genomic reassessment
{HMG-CoA} reductase {(HMGCR)} catalyzes the conversion of {HMG-CoA} to mevalonate, the rate-limiting step of eukaryotic isoprenoid biosynthesis, and is the main target of cholesterol-lowering drugs. The classical form of the enzyme is a transmembrane-protein anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum. However, during the last years several lines of evidence pointed to the existence of a second isoform of {HMGCR} localized in peroxisomes, where mevalonate is converted further to farnesyl diphosphate. This finding is relevant for our understanding of the complex regulation and compartmentalization of the cholesterogenic pathway. Here we review experimental evidence suggesting that the peroxisomal activity might be due to a second {HMGCR} gene in mammals. We then present a comprehensive analysis of completely sequenced eukaryotic genomes, as well as the human and mouse genome drafts. Our results provide evidence for a large number of independent duplications of {HMGCR} in all eukaryotic kingdoms, but not for a second gene in mammals. We conclude that the peroxisomal {HMGCR} activity in mammals is due to alternative targeting of the {ER} enzyme to peroxisomes by an as yet uncharacterized mechanisms.

The BAD Biologic Interventions Register (BADBIR) also participates in the network of European psoriasis biologics registers (Psonet). OBJECTIVES: This prospective observational cohort study compares adult patients with psoriasis treated with biologics vs. a comparator group exposed to conventional systemic therapies. METHODS: Following baseline data acquisition, clinicians record changes in therapy, disease activity and adverse events for 5years (6-monthly for 3years, then annually thereafter). Patient details are flagged lifelong on the National Health Service Information Centre system to capture occurrence of malignancy or death. Primary study endpoints include malignancy, infection, serious adverse events and death. Collection of long-term effectiveness data is a subsidiary aim. RESULTS: By November 2011, the number of dermatology centres actively recruiting across the U.K. and Republic of Ireland had risen to 108 and a further 37 were actively engaged in the set-up process. Of the 3176 patients enrolled in the study to date, 2193 were registered within the biologic cohort and 983 in the conventional systemic (nonbiologic-exposed) cohort. CONCLUSIONS: A robust, high-quality, web-based register of biologic and conventional therapy for psoriasis has been established in the U.K. This is the largest project undertaken by the BAD. The data it will provide over the coming years will be invaluable to the safe use of biologics in clinical practice. A U.K.-wide dermatology clinical research network has been established that provides a framework for future studies in other diseases.

Lipoproteins and heat shock proteins as measures of reproductive physiology in the soft shell clam, Mya arenaria
Reproduction is an important physiological process in
marine bivalve molluscs. Experiments were designed to examine
the role of lipoproteins and heat shock proteins in normal
physiological processes of the soft shell clam, Mya arenaria,
including reproduction.
The distribution of 14c triolein, an injected lipid
tracer, occurred rapidly and was unaffected by the early
stages of the disease hematopoietic neoplasia. These results,
in combination with other evidence, provide support for the
hypothesis that plasma is the primary conduit for lipid
transport in the soft shell clam. A very high density
lipoprotein (VHDL) was isolated from clam plasma. The
association of only small amounts of the lipid tracer with the
VHDL suggest that it may not play a large role in lipid
transport. The lack of information on the turnover rate of
the lipoprotein, however, makes this result uncertain.
Additionally, the expression of the heat shock protein 70
family was measured in the gill and gonad of clams from
severely (New Bedford Harbor), moderately (Cotuit Bay), and
negligibly (Little Buttermilk Bay) contaminated natural
populations. Site differences in hsp 70 expression were
observed only in the gill of clams from the New Bedford Harbor
population, suggesting that a threshold exists for the
induction of the stress response. Effects of the reproductive
cycle, however, were observed in both gill and gonad tissues.
In New Bedford Harbor, the stress associated with the later
stages of the reproductive cycle (ripe, spawning, and spent)
appears to interact synergistically with the contaminant
effect. The interpretation of a stress response associated
with exposure to environmental contaminants, therefore, must
include a careful consideration of the effect of natural
physiological processes, including reproduction, on the
expression of hsp 70.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution June 1996The work described in this dissertation has been funded

Finite-dimensional behaviour and observability in a randomly forced PDE
In earlier work D.S. Broomhead, J.P. Huke, M.R. Muldoon, and J. Stark, Iterated function system models of digital channels, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 460 (2004), pp. 3123–3142, aimed at developing an approach to signal processing that can be applied as well to nonlinear systems as linear ones, we produced mathematical models of digital communications channels that took the form of iterated function systems (IFS). For finite-dimensional systems these models have observability properties indicating they could be used for signal processing applications. Here we see how far the same approach can be taken towards the modelling of an infinite-dimensional system. The cable equation is a well-known partial differential equation (PDE) model of an imperfectly insulated uniform conductor, coupled to its surroundings by capacitive effects. (It is also much used as a basic model in theoretical neurobiology.) In this article we study the dynamics of this system when it is subjected to randomly selected discrete input pulses. The resulting IFS has a unique finite-dimensional attractor; we use results of Falconer and Solomyak to investigate the dimension of this attractor, relating it to the physical parameters of the system. Using work of Robinson, we show how some of the observability properties of the IFS model are retained.

What Capital Is Missing in Developing Countries?
What capital is missing in developing countries? We put forward “managerial capital,”
which is distinct from human capital, as a key missing form of capital in developing countries. And it has also been curiously missing in the research on growth and development. We argue in this paper that lack of managerial capital has
broad implications for firm growth as well as for the effectiveness of other input factors. A large literature in development economics aims to understand the impediments to firm growth, particularly in small and medium enterprises. Standard growth theories have explored the importance of input factors such as capital and labor in the production function of firms and countries. At the micro level, empirical studies
such as Suresh de Mel, David McKenzie and Christopher Woodruff (2008), Abhijit Banerjee
et al. (2009), and Dean Karlan and Jonathan Zinman (2009) have estimated the impact of
access to finance for capital constrained microenterprises (see Karlan and Jonathan Morduch, 2009, for a review). At the macro level, papers by Robert King and Ross Levine (1993), Raghuram Rajan and Luigi Zingales (1998), and Marianne Bertrand, Antoinette Schoar, and David Thesmar (2007) suggest the importance of the financial system for economic growth.

Double blind study of ispaghula in irritable bowel syndrome.
A double blind placebo controlled trial of ispaghula husk in 80 patients with irritable bowel syndrome is reported. Global assessment judged treatment to be satisfactory in 82% of patients receiving ispaghula and 53% of the placebo group (p less than 0.02). Bowel habit was unchanged in the placebo group, while constipation significantly improved in patients taking ispaghula (p = 0.026). Transit time decreased significantly in those taking ispaghula compared with placebo (p = 0.001), especially in patients with initially high transit times. Abdominal pain and bloating improved in both groups, with no significant differences between ispaghula and placebo. Four of the eight withdrawals on ispaghula and 10 of the 15 withdrawals on placebo were because of treatment failure. Ispaghula significantly improves overall well being in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, and in those with constipation favourably affects bowel habit and transit time.

Inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy associated with membranous glomerulonephritis and thrombocytopaenia.
A 66-year-old man with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis presented with a flaccid areflexic tetraparesis evolving over a 6-week period. Clinical examination and subsequent investigation confirmed a diagnosis of sub-acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (sub-acute IDP). Nephrotic-range proteinuria and thrombocytopaenia were also noted at the time of presentation-histopathological investigation of the former showed membranous glomerulonephritis as the basis for the protein loss. The IDP, glomerulonephritis and thrombocytopaenia recovered over the same time course. There have been previous reports of either glomerulonephritis or thrombocytopaenia occurring in association with IDP-there are no such reports of all three conditions occurring and resolving simultaneously.

[anomalous, circumflex, coronary, vessel, pcus, intervention, artery, percutaneous]

Percutaneous intervention on anomalous circumflex coronary arteries - a single centre experience.
BACKGROUND: Anomalies of the origin and course of the circumflex artery are amongst the most common seen at coronary angiography. There is limited information regarding patient and procedural characteristics, technical feasibility and outcomes associated with percutaneous intervention (PCI) to these vessels. The aim of this study is to examine our experience with PCI to anomalous circumflex vessels and compare this to some aspects of percutaneous intervention on non-anomalous circumflex vessels. METHODS: Over a 41month period, 20 PCI procedures on anomalous circumflex vessels were identified and 1550 PCI procedures on non-anomalous circumflex arteries. RESULTS: In 9 anomalous cases, the circumflex arose from the left coronary cusp, in 7 cases from the right coronary cusp, and in the remaining 4 cases from the proximal right coronary artery. There were no differences in demographics or pattern or severity of coronary disease between the 2 groups. A higher proportion of patients with anomalous vessels presented acutely. Screening times were longer in the anomalous group. All 20 procedures were associated with immediate procedural success. There was one peri-procedural myocardial infarction unrelated to anomalous circumflex intervention. After a median follow-up period of 7.3months, the only major adverse cardiac event recorded in the anomalous group was an ischaemia-driven revascularisation to a non-target vessel branch. We describe techniques which can be used to improve support and facilitate successful PCI to anomalous circumflex vessels. CONCLUSION: PCI to anomalous circumflex vessels may be technically challenging, but is feasible and carries favourable short and long-term clinical outcomes. SUMMARY: This single centre observational study demonstrates that percutaneous coronary intervention to anomalous circumflex coronary arteries although technically challenging can be performed with satisfactory procedural success rates and favourable short and longer-term clinical outcomes. It describes various techniques that can be employed to optimise successful intervention.

Protocol for the ProFHER (PROximal Fracture of the Humerus: Evaluation by Randomisation) trial: a pragmatic multi-centre randomised controlled trial of surgical versus non-surgical treatment for proximal fracture of the humerus in adults.
BACKGROUND: Proximal humeral fractures, which occur mainly in older adults, account for approximately 4 to 5% of all fractures. Approximately 40% of these fractures are displaced fractures involving the surgical neck. Management of this group of fractures is often challenging and the outcome is frequently unsatisfactory. In particular it is not clear whether surgery gives better outcomes than non-surgical management. Currently there is much variation in the use of surgery and a lack of good quality evidence to inform this decision. METHODS/DESIGN: We aim to undertake a pragmatic UK-based multi-centre randomised controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of surgical versus standard non-surgical treatment for adults with an acute closed displaced fracture of the proximal humerus with involvement of the surgical neck. The choice of surgical intervention is left to the surgeon, who must use techniques that they are fully experienced with. This will avoid 'learning curve' problems. We will promote good standards of non-surgical care, similarly insisting on care-provider competence, and emphasize the need for comparable provision of rehabilitation for both groups of patients.We aim to recruit 250 patients from a minimum of 18 NHS trauma centres throughout the UK. These patients will be followed-up for 2 years. The primary outcome is the Oxford Shoulder Score, which will be collected via questionnaires completed by the trial participants at 6, 12 and 24 months. This is a 12-item condition-specific questionnaire providing a total score based on the person's subjective assessment of pain and activities of daily living impairment. We will also collect data for other outcomes, including general health measures and complications, and for an economic evaluation. Additionally, we plan a systematic collection of reasons for non-inclusion of eligible patients who were not recruited into the trial, and their baseline characteristics, treatment preferences and intended treatment. DISCUSSION: This article presents the protocol for a multi-centre randomised controlled trial. It gives extensive details of, and the basis for, the chosen methods, and describes the key measures taken to avoid bias and to ensure validity.

Chemical allergy: Cellular and molecular mechanisms and novel approaches to predictive testing.
A wide variety of chemicals is known to cause allergy-both allergic contact dermatitis and respiratory hypersensitivity. Historically the species of choice for the predictive assessment of sensitizing potential has been the guinea pig, the emphasis being on measurement of allergic reactions provoked by challenge of previously sensitized animals. However, in parallel with enhanced understanding of the mechanisms through which chemical allergy is induced and regulated, there have emerged opportunities to define novel strategies for predictive testing. Much has been achieved in the mouse and this article will focus on new approaches to testing in this species where activity is measured as a function of events occurring during the induction phase of sensitization.

Adaptive Evolution and the Birth of CTCF Binding Sites in the Drosophila Genome
Changes in the physical interaction between cis-regulatory DNA sequences and proteins drive the evolution of gene expression. However, it has proven difficult to accurately quantify evolutionary rates of such binding change or to estimate the relative effects of selection and drift in shaping the binding evolution. Here we examine the genome-wide binding of CTCF in four species of Drosophila separated by between ~2.5 and 25 million years. CTCF is a highly conserved protein known to be associated with insulator sequences in the genomes of human and Drosophila. Although the binding preference for CTCF is highly conserved, we find that CTCF binding itself is highly evolutionarily dynamic and has adaptively evolved. Between species, binding divergence increased linearly with evolutionary distance, and CTCF binding profiles are diverging rapidly at the rate of 2.22% per million years (Myr). At least 89 new CTCF binding sites have originated in the Drosophila melanogaster genome since the most recent common ancestor with Drosophila simulans. Comparing these data to genome sequence data from 37 different strains of Drosophila melanogaster, we detected signatures of selection in both newly gained and evolutionarily conserved binding sites. Newly evolved CTCF binding sites show a significantly stronger signature for positive selection than older sites. Comparative gene expression profiling revealed that expression divergence of genes adjacent to CTCF binding site is significantly associated with the gain and loss of CTCF binding. Further, the birth of new genes is associated with the birth of new CTCF binding sites. Our data indicate that binding of Drosophila CTCF protein has evolved under natural selection, and CTCF binding evolution has shaped both the evolution of gene expression and genome evolution during the birth of new genes.

Preferred Roles in Treatment Decision Making Among Patients With Cancer: A Pooled Analysis of Studies Using the Control Preferences Scale
Background: The extent of patient involvement in the decision making process for cancer treatment can impact satisfaction with care. A pooled-analysis of clinical studies from the US and Canada incorporating the Control Preferences Scale (CPS) was conducted to produce normalized data regarding patient preferences and examine differences in role preference related to country, tumor type, gender and other demographics. Methods: Patient data culled from six trials indicated the treatment decision making role preferred and the role actually experienced clinically. Fisher's Exact Tests were performed to compare role distribution concordance and association with clinical and demographic variables. Results: Data available for 3,491 patients indicated that 25% preferred an active role, 46% a collaborative role, and 29% a passive role in their medical treatment decision making. In terms of actual experience, 30% of patients reported taking on an active role, 34% collaborative, and 36% passive. Overall, 61% of patients reported playing the role they prefer. Differences between genders in the preferred role were slight, but males achieved their preferred role more often than females (66% vs. 60%, p=0.011). More women actually took a passive role than men (40% vs. 24%, p<0.0001) as did more patients in the US than Canada (84% vs. 54%, p<0.001). Canadian patients preferred more passive than active roles (33% vs 22.4%) and US patients preferred more active to passive roles (31.9% vs 14.2%) (p<0.001). Older patients preferred a more passive role and took on that role. Differences in role preference across tumor types were negligible. Conclusions: Roughly one half of the cancer patients studied indicated that they preferred to have a collaborative relationship with physicians, the remaining patients split equally between an active and passive role. The US cohort seemed to want to be more assertive than their Canadian counterparts and women ended up playing a more passive role than they preferred. Given these gender and cross-county differences these findings highlight the need for individualized patient communication styles to be incorporated into treatment plans

Towards an unbiased metabolic profiling of protozoan parasites: Optimisation of a Leishmania sampling protocol for HILIC-orbitrap analysis
Comparative metabolomics of Leishmania species requires the simultaneous identification and quantification of a large number of intracellular metabolites. Here, we describe the optimisation of a comprehensive metabolite extraction protocol for Leishmania parasites and the subsequent optimisation of the analytical approach, consisting of hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled to {LTQ-orbitrap} mass spectrometry. The final optimised protocol starts with a rapid quenching of parasite cells to 0 {??C}, followed by a triplicate washing step in phosphate-buffered saline. The intracellular metabolome of 4 ?? 10 7 parasites is then extracted in cold chloroform/methanol/water 20/60/20 (v/v/v) for 1 h at 4 {??C}, resulting in both cell disruption and comprehensive metabolite dissolution. Our developed metabolomics platform can detect approximately 20\% of the predicted Leishmania metabolome in a single experiment in positive and negative ionisation mode. ?? 2010 {Springer-Verlag.}

DEVELOPMENT OF ZEOLITES AND ZEOLITE MEMBRANES FROM AHOKO NIGERIAN KAOLIN
Zeolites and zeolite membranes are two important advanced chemical materials which are widely used in chemical processes. The manufacture of these materials usually involves the use of expensive chemicals. This study involves the use of Ahoko Nigerian kaolin (ANK) as precursor material for the development of zeolites and zeolite membranes. The synthesis of zeolite A, Y and ZSM-5 was successfully obtained following a sequence, collection of the raw clay from Nigeria, metakaolinization, dealumination and actual hydrothermal synthesis of the zeolites. Raw ANK was refined using sedimentation technique and about 97% kaolin was recovered from the raw sample. A novel metakaolinization technique was developed to convert kaolin into a reactive metastable phase. Amorphous metakaolin was obtained at a temperature of 600oC and exposure time of 10 min. This is a significant result because previous studies use higher temperatures and longer exposure times for the metakaolinization step. The metakaolin was used to prepare a number of different zeolites under various conditions. Highly crystalline zeolite A was obtained at an ageing time of 12 h, crystallization time of 6 h and crystallization temperature of 100oC. Zeolite Y was obtained at an ageing time of 3 h, crystallization time of 9 h and crystallization temperature of 100oC. Zeolite Y was also synthesised by using a dealuminated kaolin and highly crystallized zeolite Y with Si/Al ratio of 1.56 and BET surface area was obtained of 630 m2/g. ZSM-5 was synthesised using an ageing period of 36 h, crystallization time of 48 h and temperature of 140oC. The results obtained from zeolite powder synthesis from ANK were then used as guide to prepare supported zeolite films and membranes by a hydrothermal method. The effect of the support surface (stainless steel) was investigated using two synthesis methods namely modified in-situ and secondary (seeded) growth. Zeolite A, Y and ZSM-5 films were successfully prepared from ANK for the first time and on two modified supports, etched and oxidised. The zeolite films and membranes developed showed complete coverage on the two supports with the oxidised showing better adhesion and intergrowth. The separation performance of the three developed zeolite membrane was tested by pervaporation of water/ethanol mixture. The results of pervaporation of ethanol/water mixture showed that zeolite A membrane is highly selective towards water mainly because of hydrophilic properties occasioned by the high aluminium content. Zeolite Y membrane show a similar response when their separation performance was evaluated but with less selectivity because of reduced aluminium content. ZSM-5 showed selectivity towards ethanol because of it hydrophobicity allowing only ethanol to permeate.  In all the zeolite membranes, the flux is lower in comparison to commercial zeolite membranes due mainly to the thickness of the zeolite layer. Oxidised support membranes showed better performance because of their better interaction between the oxide surface and the aluminosilicate gel. The results show that ANK can successfully be used to prepare zeolites and zeolite membrane.

Making pain visible: an audit and review of documentation to improve the use of pain assessment by implementing pain as the 5th vital sign.
Background. Pain has been promoted as the 5th vital sign for a decade but there is little empirical evidence to suggest that doing so has affected the care of individuals suffering pain. Method. This was a three stage audit of pain assessment in one large teaching hospital in the North West of England. Stage one measured the baseline pain assessment activity on surgical and medical wards and identified that the pain assessment tool was not visible to nurses. Stage two re-designed the patient observation charts held at the end of the bed and piloted two versions for clinical utility. Version 2 which had pain assessment alongside the early warning score was adopted and introduced throughout the hospital. Stage three audited pain assessment and management eight months after the introduction of the new charts.Results. Pain was assessed more regularly at the stage three audit than at the baseline audit.  On average pain was assessed alongside other routine observations 70% of the time across surgical and medical wards. Medical wards appeared to improve their pain assessment using the philosophy of pain being the 5th vital sign better than surgical wards as they assessed pain alongside routine observations in more than 90% of cases. Stage three identified that where a high pain score was recorded analgesia was delivered in the majority of cases (88%).Conclusion. Introducing the philosophy of pain as the 5th vital sign and making pain assessment more visible on the patient observation chart improved the uptake of pain assessment. Pain management strategies were stimulated when high pain scores were identified.

Separating the wheat from the chaff: A prioritisation pipeline for the analysis of metabolomics datasets
Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry {(LC-MS)} is a powerful and widely applied method for the study of biological systems, biomarker discovery and pharmacological interventions. {LC-MS} measurements are, however, significantly complicated by several technical challenges, including: (1) ionisation suppression/enhancement, disturbing the correct quantification of analytes, and (2) the detection of large amounts of separate derivative ions, increasing the complexity of the spectra, but not their information content. Here we introduce an experimental and analytical strategy that leads to robust metabolome profiles in the face of these challenges. Our method is based on rigorous filtering of the measured signals based on a series of sample dilutions. Such data sets have the additional characteristic that they allow a more robust assessment of detection signal quality for each metabolite. Using our method, almost 80\% of the recorded signals can be discarded as uninformative, while important information is retained. As a consequence, we obtain a broader understanding of the information content of our analyses and a better assessment of the metabolites detected in the analyzed data sets. We illustrate the applicability of this method using standard mixtures, as well as cell extracts from bacterial samples. It is evident that this method can be applied in many types of {LC-MS} analyses and more specifically in untargeted metabolomics. ?? 2011 The Author(s).

Intestinal microbiota in functional bowel disorders: a Rome foundation report.
It is increasingly perceived that gut host-microbial interactions are important elements in the pathogenesis of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID). The most convincing evidence to date is the finding that functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may develop in predisposed individuals following a bout of infectious gastroenteritis. There has been a great deal of interest in the potential clinical and therapeutic implications of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in IBS. However, this theory has generated much debate because the evidence is largely based on breath tests which have not been validated. The introduction of culture-independent molecular techniques provides a major advancement in our understanding of the microbial community in FGID. Results from 16S rRNA-based microbiota profiling approaches demonstrate both quantitative and qualitative changes of mucosal and faecal gut microbiota, particularly in IBS. Investigators are also starting to measure host-microbial interactions in IBS. The current working hypothesis is that abnormal microbiota activate mucosal innate immune responses which increase epithelial permeability, activate nociceptive sensory pathways and dysregulate the enteric nervous system. While we await important insights in this field, the microbiota is already a therapeutic target. Existing controlled trials of dietary manipulation, prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics and non-absorbable antibiotics are promising, although most are limited by suboptimal design and small sample size. In this article, the authors provide a critical review of current hypotheses regarding the pathogenetic involvement of microbiota in FGID and evaluate the results of microbiota-directed interventions. The authors also provide clinical guidance on modulation of gut microbiota in IBS.

Optical and electrical activity of defects in rare earth implanted Si
<p>A common technique for introducing rare earth atoms into Si and related materials for photonic applications is ion implantation. It is compatible with standard Si processing, and also allows high, non-equilibrium concentrations of rare earths to be introduced. However, the high energies often employed mean that there are collision cascades and potentially severe end-of-range damage. This paper reports on studies of this damage, and the competition it may present to the optical activity of the rare earths. Er-, Si, and Yb-implanted Si samples have been investigated, before and after anneals designed to restore the sample crystallinity. The electrical activity of
defects in as-implanted Er, Si, and Yb doped Si has been studied by Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy (DTLS) and the related, high resolution technique, Laplace DLTS (LDLTS), as a function of annealing. Er-implanted Si, regrown by solid phase epitaxy at 600degrees C and then subject to a rapid thermal anneal, has also been studied by time-resolved photoluminescence (PL). The LDLTS studies reveal that there are clear differences in the defect population as a function of depth from the surface, and this is attributed to different defects in the vacancy-rich and interstitial-rich regions. Defects in the interstitial-rich region have electrical characteristics typical of small extended defects, and these may provide the precursors for larger structural defects in annealed layers. The time-resolved PL of the annealed layers, in combination with electron microscopy, shows that the Er emission at 1.54microns contains a fast component attributed to non-radiative recombination at deep states due to small dislocations. It is concluded that there can be measurable competition to the radiative efficiency in rare-earth implanted Si that is due to the implantation and is not specific to Er.</p>

Distinct clinical and pathological characteristics of frontotemporal dementia associated with C9ORF72 mutations.
The identification of a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9ORF72 gene as the cause of chromosome 9-linked frontotemporal dementia and motor neuron disease offers the opportunity for greater understanding of the relationship between these disorders and other clinical forms of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. In this study, we screened a cohort of 398 patients with frontotemporal dementia, progressive non-fluent aphasia, semantic dementia or mixture of these syndromes for mutations in the C9ORF72 gene. Motor neuron disease was present in 55 patients (14%). We identified 32 patients with C9ORF72 mutations, representing 8% of the cohort. The patients' clinical phenotype at presentation varied: nine patients had frontotemporal dementia with motor neuron disease, 19 had frontotemporal dementia alone, one had mixed semantic dementia with frontal features and three had progressive non-fluent aphasia. There was, as expected, a significant association between C9ORF72 mutations and presence of motor neuron disease. Nevertheless, 46 patients, including 22 familial, had motor neuron disease but no mutation in C9ORF72. Thirty-eight per cent of the patients with C9ORF72 mutations presented with psychosis, with a further 28% exhibiting paranoid, deluded or irrational thinking, whereas <4% of non-mutation bearers presented similarly. The presence of psychosis dramatically increased the odds that patients carried the mutation. Mutation bearers showed a low incidence of motor stereotypies, and relatively high incidence of complex repetitive behaviours, largely linked to patients' delusions. They also showed a lower incidence of acquired sweet food preference than patients without C9ORF72 mutations. Post-mortem pathology in five patients revealed transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 pathology, type A in one patient and type B in three. However, one patient had corticobasal degeneration pathology. The findings indicate that C9ORF72 mutations cause some but not all cases of frontotemporal dementia with motor neuron disease. Other mutations remain to be discovered. C9ORF72 mutations are associated with variable clinical presentations and pathology. Nevertheless, the findings highlight a powerful association between C9ORF72 mutations and psychosis and suggest that the behavioural characteristics of patients with C9ORF72 mutations are qualitatively distinct. Mutations in the C9ORF72 gene may be a major cause not only of frontotemporal dementia with motor neuron disease but also of late onset psychosis.

A manganese-rich environment supports superoxide dismutase activity in a lyme disease pathogen, Borrelia burgdorferi
The Lyme disease pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi represents a novel organism in which to study metalloprotein biology in that this spirochete has uniquely evolved with no requirement for iron. Not only is iron low, but we show here that B. burgdorferi has the capacity to accumulate remarkably high levels of manganese. This high manganese is necessary to activate the SodA superoxide dismutase (SOD) essential for virulence. Using a metalloproteomic approach, we demonstrate that a bulk of B. burgdorferi SodA directly associates with manganese and a smaller pool of inactive enzyme accumulates as apoprotein. Other metalloproteins may have similarly adapted to using manganese as co-factor including the BB0366 amino-peptidase. While B. burgdorferi SodA has evolved in a manganese-rich, iron-poor environment, the opposite is true for Mn-SODs of organisms such as E. coli and bakers’ yeast. These Mn-SODs still capture manganese in an iron-rich cell, and we tested whether the same is true for Borrelia SodA. When expressed in the iron-rich mitochondria of S. cerevisiae, B. burgdorferi SodA was inactive. Activity was only possible when cells accumulated extremely high levels of manganese that exceeded cellular iron. Moreover, there was no evidence for iron inactivation of the SOD. B. burgdorferi SodA shows strong overall homology with other members of the Mn-SOD family, but computer assisted modeling revealed some unusual features of the hydrogen bonding network near the enzyme’s active site. The unique properties of B. burgdorferi SodA may represent adaptation to expression in the manganese-rich and iron-poor environment of the spirochete.Author Posting. © The Author(s), 2013.

Trends in single-particle energies in N=51 nuclei
A systematic study of the neutron single-particle states in N=51 isotones has been performed. Final states in 89Sr, 91Zr and 93Mo have been populated using the (d,p) and (alpha,3He) single-neutron adding reactions. The Yale tandem provided beams of 15-MeV deuterons and 50-MeV alpha particles with the outgoing ejectiles momentum analysed using an Enge split-pole spectrometer. A supplementary measurement of the d(86Kr,p)87Kr reaction, at a beam energy of 10 MeV/u, was made in inverse kinematics using the HELIOS spectrometer. Outgoing protons execute a helical orbit in a uniform field before detection, before they return to axis, using a position-sensitive silicon array. Absolute cross sections were measured for states up to 4 MeV in excitation. The transferred angular momentum was identified through a comparison of angular distributions and the ratio of cross section between reactions. Relative spectroscopic factors were extracted through a DWBA analysis.The measured centroids for the single-particle energies of the s1/2, d3/2, d5/2, g7/2 and h11/2 orbitals were compared to calculations using a Gaussian central potential with and without the addition of a tensor interaction. Through this comparison it was deduced that the inclusion of a tensor interaction is required to explain the observed shifts in the single-particle energies of the d3/2 and g7/2 orbitals. This system provided an observation of a switch in behaviour, from repulsive to attractive and vice versa, of the effect of the tensor interaction. This occurs due to a change from j> to j< proton occupancy at Z=40.

ANTICANCER ACTIVITY OF Adina cordifolia AGAINST EHRLICH ASCITES CARCINOMA (EAC) IN MICE.
The acetone and ethanol extracts from the leaves of Adina cordifolia i.e. AEAC and EEAC respectively were evaluated for anticancer activity against Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma (EAC) bearing Swiss albino mice. The extracts were administered at the doses of 500 mg/kg body weight per day for 14 days after 24 h of tumor inoculation. 24 h after the last dose, with fasting, the mice were sacrificed. The present study deals with the effect of AEAC and EEAC on mean survival time, peritoneal cell count, hematological studies, tumor volume, tumor weight, tumor cell count, body weight and In vitro cytotoxicity. AEAC and EEAC caused significant decrease in tumor volume, tumor weight, tumor cell count, body weight and it prolonged the life span i.e. mean survival time of EAC-tumor bearing mice and normal peritoneal cell count in normal mice. Hematological profile converted to more or less normal levels in AEAC and EEAC treated mice. AEAC and EEAC also exhibited significant cytotoxic activity at 200&micro;g/ml, but higher cytotoxic activity was found in AEAC. The results indicate that AEAC and EEAC exhibited significant anticancer activity in EAC-bearing mice. &nbsp; KEYWORDS: Anticancer Activity, Adina cordifolia, Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma (EAC).

[cell, eosinophilia, ox40, ox40l, neoforman]

OX40 ligation on activated T cells enhances the control of Cryptococcus neoformans and reduces pulmonary eosinophilia.
Pulmonary eosinophilia induced in C57BL/6 mice after Cryptococcus neoformans infection is driven by CD4(+) Th2 cells. The immunological mechanisms that protect against eosinophilia are not fully understood. Interaction of OX40 (CD134) and its ligand, OX40L, has been implicated in T cell activation and cell migration. Unlike CD28, OX40 is only expressed on T cells 1-2 days after Ag activation. Manipulation of this pathway would therefore target recently activated T cells, leaving the naive repertoire unaffected. In this study, we show that engagement of OX40 by an OX40L:Ig fusion protein drives IFN-gamma production by CD4(+) T cells and reduces eosinophilia and C. neoformans burden in the lung. Using gene-depleted mice, we show that reduction of eosinophilia and pathogen burden requires IL-12 and/or IFN-gamma. C. neoformans infection itself only partially induces OX40L expression by APCs. Provision of exogenous OX40L reveals a critical role of this pathway in the prevention of C. neoformans-induced eosinophilia.

The effect of thermal oxidation on polycrystalline graphite studied by X-ray tomography
The effect of thermal oxidation on PGA graphite samples was investigated by X-ray tomography. This technique allowed an investigation of the evolution of microstructure and local density to be carried out as a function of weight loss. The results show a localised oxidation process which progressively reveals the large coke particles with increasing overall weight loss. The local density measurements arising from the tomographs were used to estimate the weight loss distribution. The reliability of the values were checked by independent thermal conductivity measurements and volume weight loss calculations by immersion technique. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

[cytokine, stroke, plasma, control, production, patient, blood, receptor, ischaemic, ais]

Clinical outcome following acute ischaemic stroke relates to both activation and autoregulatory inhibition of cytokine production.
BACKGROUND: As critical mediators of local and systemic inflammatory responses, cytokines are produced in the brain following ischaemic stroke. Some have been detected in the circulation of stroke patients, but their role and source is unclear. Focusing primarily on interleukin(IL)-1-related mechanisms, we serially measured plasma inflammatory markers, and the production of cytokines by whole blood, from 36 patients recruited within 12 h and followed up to 1 year after acute ischaemic stroke (AIS). RESULTS: Admission plasma IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) concentration was elevated, relative to age-, sex-, and atherosclerosis-matched controls. IL-1beta, soluble IL-1 receptor type II, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, TNF-RII, IL-10 and leptin concentrations did not significantly differ from controls, but peak soluble TNF receptor type I (sTNF-RI) in the first week correlated strongly with computed tomography infarct volume at 5-7 days, mRS and BI at 3 and 12 months. Neopterin was raised in patients at 5-7 d, relative to controls, and in subjects with significant atherosclerosis. Spontaneous IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IL-6 gene and protein expression by blood cells was minimal, and induction of these cytokines by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was significantly lower in patients than in controls during the first week. Minimum LPS-induced cytokine production correlated strongly with mRS and BI, and also with plasma cortisol. CONCLUSION: Absence of spontaneous whole blood gene activation or cytokine production suggests that peripheral blood cells are not the source of cytokines measured in plasma after AIS. Increased plasma IL-1ra within 12 h of AIS onset, the relationship between sTNF-RI and stroke severity, and suppressed cytokine induction suggests early activation of endogenous immunosuppressive mechanisms after AIS.

[fibrosis, year, treatment, carmustine, survivor, patient, lung, abnormal]

Active lung fibrosis up to 17 years after chemotherapy with carmustine (BCNU) in childhood.
BACKGROUND: Carmustine (BCNU) is an anticancer drug known to produce pulmonary fibrosis as a side effect within three years of treatment. It is not known whether pulmonary fibrosis can appear later. METHODS: To investigate the clinical range of this side effect, we studied the survivors among 31 children treated with carmustine for brain tumors between 1972 and 1976. Fourteen had died of their tumor; of the remaining 17, 6 had died of lung fibrosis--2 within 3 years of treatment and 4 from 8 to 13 years after treatment. This report focuses primarily on the 11 survivors, 8 of whom were available for detailed study 13 to 17 years (mean, 14) after treatment. RESULTS: Of the eight survivors studied, six had abnormal chest radiographs showing predominantly upper-zone fibrotic changes. These patients also had abnormal CT scans, showing a previously undescribed pattern of upper-zone fibrosis. All the survivors studied had restrictive spirometric defects (mean +/- SD vital capacity, 54 +/- 19 percent of the predicted value). Bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid contained abnormal proportions of specific macrophage subgroups. Light and electron microscopy in six patients revealed interstitial fibrosis and elastosis with damage to epithelial and endothelial cells. Four patients had symptoms (shortness of breath, cough, or both). CONCLUSIONS: Carmustine chemotherapy in childhood causes lung fibrosis that may remain asymptomatic for many years or become symptomatic at any time.

Proarrhythmia in KCNJ2-linked short QT syndrome: insights from modelling.
AIMS: One form of the short QT syndrome (SQT3) has been linked to the D172N gain-in-function mutation to Kir2.1, which preferentially increases outward current through channels responsible for inward rectifier K(+) current (I(K1)). This study investigated mechanisms by which the Kir2.1 D172N mutation facilitates and perpetuates ventricular arrhythmias. METHODS AND RESULTS: The ten Tusscher et al. model for human ventricular action potentials (APs) was modified to incorporate changes to I(K1) based on experimentally observed changes to Kir2.1 function: both heterozygous (WT-D172N) and homozygous (D172N) mutant scenarios were studied. Cell models were incorporated into heterogeneous one-dimensional (1D), 2D tissue, and 3D models to compute the restitution curves of AP duration (APD-R), effective refractory period (ERP-R), and conduction velocity (CV). Temporal and spatial vulnerability of ventricular tissue to re-entry was measured and dynamic behaviour of re-entrant excitation waves (lifespan and dominant frequency) in 2D and 3D models of the human ventricle was characterized. D172N 'mutant' I(K1) led to abbreviated APD and ERP, as well as steeper APD-R and ERP-R curves. It reduced tissue excitability at low excitation rates but increased it at high rates. It increased tissue temporal vulnerability for initiating re-entry, but reduced the minimal substrate size necessary to sustain re-entry. SQT3 'mutant' I(K1) also stabilized and accelerated re-entrant excitation waves, leading to sustained rapid re-entry. CONCLUSION: Increased I(K1) due to the Kir2.1 D172N mutation increases arrhythmia risk due to increased tissue vulnerability, shortened ERP, and altered excitability, which in combination facilitate initiation and maintenance of re-entrant circuits.

N=14 and 16 Shell Gaps in Neutron-Rich Oxygen Isotopes
<p>In-beam gamma-ray spectroscopy using fragmentation reactions of both stable and radioactive beams has been performed in order to study the structure of excited states in neutron-rich oxygen isotopes with masses ranging from A=20 to 24. For the produced fragments, gamma-ray energies, intensities, and gamma-gamma coincidences have been measured. Based on this information new level schemes are proposed for O-21,O-22 up to the neutron separation energy. The nonobservation of any gamma-decay branch from O-23 and O-24 suggests that their excited states lie above the neutron decay thresholds. From this, as well as from the level schemes proposed for O-21 and O-22, the size of the N=14 and 16 shell gaps in oxygen isotopes is discussed in the light of shell-model calculations.</p>

Rethinking partnership in initial teacher education – developing professional identities for a new subject specialist team which includes a joint school-university appointment – a case study in mathematics
A new team of mathematics educators is establishing at the University of Manchester. One member of the team is a joint school-university appointment. A former local authority consultant she now works 50% in a partnership training school where she mentors four students and 50% as a PGCE tutor contributing to all elements of the PGCE course including subject specific and professional studies sessions, tutoring a number of students including school visits.What are the affordances of a joint school-university appointment? What are the personal challenges for the appointee and colleagues working with the appointee – in school and in university?Evidence for the paper is through personal reflective accounts, and focus group discussions with school and university colleagues. There will also be an anonymous questionnaire of student teachers to find out whether the joint school-university appointee’s support is qualitatively different to that of other tutors.Becoming a teacher educator is challenging at the best of times (Berry, 2007; Swennen & van der Klink, 2009), as is establishing yourself as a teacher in a new school (Day et al. 2007). To do both at once is novel, but given current government priorities something that is likely to become more commonplace, with initiatives such as School Direct (TDA, 2011).Professional identity provides a means of interpreting the way practitioners conduct their work (Day et al, 2005) and the development needs they prioritise. In school there are priorities of learning systems and policies and establishing oneself as a member of the adult community. In higher education this often includes embarking on Masters level study as a requirement for becoming a higher education lecturer (HE academy n.d.). The outcomes of this early experience have implications for the developing practice of the University of Manchester PGCE mathematics team and the way in which university and school based colleagues work together to optimise learning for beginning teachers, as new models of ITE are adopted within a well-established partnership. These implications may provide areas for consideration by institutions rethinking partnership in initial teacher education.

[diffusion, treatment, tumor, length, adc, scale, time, long, cell, temporal]

Characterizing tumor response to chemotherapy at various length scales using temporal diffusion spectroscopy.
Measurements of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been suggested as potential imaging biomarkers for monitoring tumor response to treatment. However, conventional pulsed-gradient spin echo (PGSE) methods incorporate relatively long diffusion times, and are usually sensitive to changes in cell density and necrosis. Diffusion temporal spectroscopy using the oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) sequence is capable of probing short length scales, and may detect significant intracellular microstructural changes independent of gross cell density changes following anti-cancer treatment. To test this hypothesis, SW620 xenografts were treated by barasertib (AZD1152), a selective inhibitor of Aurora B kinase which causes SW620 cancer cells to develop polyploidy and increase in size following treatment, ultimately leading to cell death through apoptosis. Following treatment, the ADC values obtained by both the PGSE and low frequency OGSE methods increased. However, the ADC values at high gradient frequency (i.e. short diffusion times) were significantly lower in treated tumors, consistent with increased intracellular restrictions/hindrances. This suggests that ADC values at long diffusion times are dominated by tumor microstructure at long length scales, and may not convey unambiguous information of subcellular space. While the diffusion temporal spectroscopy provides more comprehensive means to probe tumor microstructure at various length scales. This work is the first study to probe intracellular microstructural variations due to polyploidy following treatment using diffusion MRI in vivo. It is also the first observation of post-treatment ADC changes occurring in opposite directions at short and long diffusion times. The current study suggests that temporal diffusion spectroscopy potentially provides pharmacodynamic biomarkers of tumor early response which distinguish microstructural variations following treatment at both the subcellular and supracellular length scales.

Comparison of out of hours care provided by patients' own general practitioners and commercial deputising services: a randomised controlled trial. II: The outcome of care.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcome of out of hours care given by general practitioners from patients' own practices and by commercial deputising services. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Four urban areas in Manchester, Salford, Stockport, and Leicester. SUBJECTS: 2152 patients who requested out of hours care, and 49 practice doctors and 183 deputising doctors (61% local principals in general practice) who responded to the requests. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Health status outcome, patient satisfaction, and subsequent health service use. RESULTS: Patients seen by deputising doctors were less satisfied with the care they received. The mean overall satisfaction score for practice doctors was 70.7 (95% confidence interval 68.1 to 73.2) and for deputising doctors 61.8 (59.9 to 63.7). The greatest difference in satisfaction was with the delay in visiting. There were no differences in the change in health or overall health status measured 24 to 120 hours after the out of hours call or subsequent use of the health service in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients are more satisfied with the out of hours care provided by practice doctors than that provided by deputising doctors. Organisation of doctors into large groups may produce lower levels of patient satisfaction, especially when associated with increased delays in the time taken to visit. There seem to be no appreciable differences in health outcome between the two types of service.

A description and evaluation of a challenging behaviour workshop.
BACKGROUND: Ensuring good quality staff and patient relationships are key goals of long-stay inpatient services. It is therefore essential that staff have a good understanding of patients' needs and how to work with the challenges that can present in these environments. AIMS: We evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a workshop to help psychiatric staff with challenging behaviours. DESIGN: We used a quasi experimental design with assessments carried out at baseline and post intervention. We provided the training to staff on one low secure psychiatric unit and recorded the uptake of outcome assessments and the workshop itself. We assessed staff-patient relationships, burnout and ward atmosphere and staff also completed satisfaction questionnaires. RESULTS: Sixty-six percent of staff (n = 25) who were eligible to participate in the project completed initial outcome measures, but only 42% (n = 16) attended the workshop and only 34% (n = 13) completed follow-up measures. The workshop had no predicted effects on any of the outcomes assessed, but staff satisfaction with the training was generally positive. CONCLUSIONS: Building up positive relationships with staff, addressing negative expectations and seeking support from all levels of management are essential in terms of reducing barriers to training in psychiatric settings.

Identification of carcinoma cells in peripheral blood samples of patients with advanced breast carcinoma using RT-PCR amplification of CK7 and MUC1.
We have undertaken a pilot study to attempt to identify circulating carcinoma cells in a series of patients with advanced breast carcinoma, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to amplify mRNA of epithelial specific antigens. Using this method to amplify mRNA of MUC1 and cytokeratin 7 (CK7) the sensitivity of the technique was demonstrated by means of diluted concentrations of "spiked MCF7" cells in whole blood, showing a detection limit of 1 in 10(6) (CK7) and 1 in 10(5) (MUC1). Positive results were obtained from the peripheral blood of all nine female patients with advanced breast cancer for CK7 and eight of the nine patients for MUC1. CK7 was however detected in five of 11 healthy controls (eight females, three males) and MUC1 in one of the 11 controls. None of the control group were positive for both CK7 and MUC1, in contrast to eight of the nine patients with advanced breast carcinoma who were positive for both markers. The RT-PCR method thus appears sufficiently sensitive to identify circulating tumour cells in peripheral blood samples from patients with advanced breast carcinoma. However a high proportion of false-positive results was seen in the control population. More extensive investigation is required before the technique is likely to be of benefit clinically.

Toll Like receptor 7 regulates viral loads and cytokine secretion during acute retroviral infection
Background: Acute HIV infection is characterized by a high viremia accompanied by a powerful wave of pro-inflammatory cytokines that affects the subsequent course of infection and pathogenesis. Thus, understanding the mechanisms that regulate cytokine secretion and viremia is a key priority. The innate immune receptor TLR7 has been identified a retrovirus-sensing protein, and is expressed in several key immune lineages. In vitro data suggests that HIV can trigger TLR7-dependent innate immune responses, but TLR7s role in vivo is unclear.

Exploring the metabolic state of microorganisms using metabolomics
Microorganisms depend on their ability to modulate their metabolic composition according to specific circumstances, such as different phases of the growth cycle and circadian rhythms, fluctuations in environmental conditions, as well as experimental perturbations. A thorough understanding of these metabolic adaptations requires the ability to comprehensively identify and quantify the metabolome of bacterial cells in different states. In this review, we present an overview of the diverse metabolomics approaches recently adopted to explore the metabolism of a wide variety of microorganisms. Focusing on a selection of illustrative case studies, we assess the different experimental designs used and explore the major achievements and remaining challenges in the field. We conclude by discussing the important complementary information provided by computational methods such as genome-scale metabolic modeling, which enable an integrated analysis of metabolic state changes in the context of overall cellular physiology. ?? 2011 Future Science Ltd.

The effect of IL-12 treatment on vaccine-enhanced illness during infection with respiratory syncytial virus.
In humans and mice, sensitisation to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) antigens can result in severe inflammatory lung disease during subsequent infection with the virus. Although specific antiviral T cells are thought to be responsible for this augmentation of disease, the precise role of different functional subsets is unknown. BALB/c mice sensitised to the major surface glycoprotein (G) of RSV expressed by recombinant vaccinia virus develop Th2-driven lung eosinophilia after intranasal challenge with the virus. Mice treated with IL-12 at various times during vaccination and challenge, had reduced vaccine-induced lung eosinophilia but increased total pulmonary lymphoid cell infiltration. Intracellular cytokine analysis showed that interferon-gamma production during challenge was increased and IL-4 and IL-5 reduced by IL-12 treatment. Though IL-12 treatment reduced lung eosinophilia, illness (as assessed by weight loss) was not eliminated and sometimes increased. Reversing Th2-associated pathology with IL-12 does not necessarily benefit the host.

The antenna incorporates two novel features: firstly, two concentric ring sub-arrays of linearly polarized elements are used to improve the axial ratio and, secondly, development of a new model for power distribution to ensure that all the elements radiate the same power, thus ensuring pattern symmetry and high-quality circular polarization. The proposed design was validated through practical measurements, which showed a well-matched antenna with good axial ratio and well-defined radiation patterns.</p>

Classification of anemia on the basis of ferrokinetic parameters
Quantitative information on abnormalities of erythropoiesis and mechanisms of anaemia has been obtained in 136 anaemic patients by means of mathematical analysis of data from ferrokinetic studies. Such information has been used to derive a functional classification of anaemia. Main functional classes in the proposed classification are anaemia with low potential erythropoiesis and anaemia with high potential erythropoiesis. Within the former class, subclasses exhibiting different qualitative patterns of disturbance of erythropoiesis were singled out. Among patients with high potential erythropoiesis, two classes were identified which are characterized by the value of effective erythropoiesis, and separate patients having ineffective erythropoiesis or peripheral haemolysis as the major anaemia mechanism from the remaining ones. The proposed functional classification provides a complete picture of the different pathogenetic mechanisms and may represent the basis for a more rational diagnostic approach to erythroid disorders.

Gathering insights on disease etiology from gene expression profiles of healthy tissues.
MOTIVATION: Gene expression profiles have been widely used to study disease states. It may be possible, however, to gather insights into human diseases by comparing gene expression profiles of healthy organs with different disease incidence or severity. We tested this hypothesis and developed an approach to identify candidate genes associated with disease development by focusing on cancer incidence since it varies greatly across human organs. RESULTS: We normalized organ-specific cancer incidence by organ weight and found that reproductive organs tend to have a higher mass-normalized cancer incidence, which could be due to evolutionary trade-offs. Next, we performed a genome-wide scan to identify genes whose expression across healthy organs correlates with organ-specific cancer incidence. We identified a large number of genes, including genes previously associated with tumorigenesis and new candidate genes. Most genes exhibiting a positive correlation with cancer incidence were related to ribosomal and transcriptional activity, translation and protein synthesis. Organs with enhanced transcriptional and translational activation may have higher cell proliferation and therefore be more likely to develop cancer. Organs with lower cancer incidence also tend to express lower levels of known cancer-associated genes. Overall, these results demonstrate how genes and processes that predispose organs to specific diseases can be identified using gene expression profiles from healthy tissues. Our approach can be applied to other diseases and serve as foundation for further oncogenomic analyses.

Fishing for answers off Fukushima
The triple disaster of the March 11, 2011, earthquake, tsunami, and subsequent radiation releases at Fukushima Dai-ichi were, and continue to be, unprecedented events for the ocean and for society. More than 80% of the radioactivity from Fukushima was either blown offshore or directly discharged in to the ocean from waters used to cool the nuclear power plants (1). Although offshore waters are safe with respect to international standards for radionuclides in the ocean (2), the nuclear power plants continue to leak radioactive contaminants into the ocean (3), and many near-shore fisheries remain closed.Author Posting. © The Author(s), 2012.

Long-term Natural Laboratories for in-depth studies of the seafloor at both a slowspreading (<30 mm/yr) and a fast-spreading (>60 mm/yr) mid-ocean ridge are being established by the Office of Naval Research. The two Natural Laboratories were selected for their representativeness of global mid-ocean ridge environments, and for their logistic accessibility. The Natural Laboratory region for the slow-spreading regime is on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge from Kane Fracture Zone north to about 27°30″N (Figure 1), and the fast-spreading counterpart is on the East Pacific Rise at about 8°–10°30″N, from Siqueiros to Clipperton Fracture Zone (Figure 2). Together, the two Natural Laboratories include most significant geologic variables that are thought to control both the shape and structure of the igneous crust and the scatter of acoustic wavefields from the bottom/subbottom (BSB) at low angles of incidence.Author Posting. © American Geophysical Union, 1991.

'The Universal and the particular in social models for health and social care - the response to difference, suffering and social injustice in international social iinclusion policy and its emancipatory alternatives'. Association of the Schools of Social Work (IASSW).July 20-24 2008. Durban, South Africa.(Peer Reviewed
Social models are influential in international social policy, treating social inclusion as a central remedy to health and social care concerns.  This promises great potential for social work to promote its international social justice and individual empowerment value-base, linked to social understandings of service users' concerns (International Association of Schools of Social Work and the International Federation of Social Workers 2001), However, social theory encompasses different perspectives, carrying radically different policy and practice implications. International social inclusion policy assumes social theory that treats social inclusion itself, accessed through individual capacity, participation, and self management of health as the best route to positive outcomes. Significantly, however, these understandings are linked to the historical European Enlightenment concept of the normal human being as completely in control of self and environment, seeing vulnerability to the impact of social and biological forces as marginal in human society. The paper will therefore trace the socio-historical assumptions involved in these policies, together with their implications for the exclusion of service users facing immense damage, suffering and social injustice through inequalities,  those who cannot aspire to self-sufficiency, and individuals, cultures and social groups with different values.  The paper will then explore alternative social theories which both recognise human beings as authors of their lives but also heavily impacted upon by social exclusion and inequalities, and will trace the implications of these perspectives for emancipatory policy and practice, which recognises the universality of vulnerability to suffering and social injustice, and the particularity of human difference, across the globe.

Modeling of electrophysiology and simulation of ECG under ischemic condition in human ventricular tissue.
In this paper, to analyze the functional influence of ischemia on cardiac cell electrical activity and subsequently on ventricular electrical wave conduction, a human ventricular ischemic model was developed, which took into account three major pathophysiological components of ischemias hyperkalaemia, acidosis, and anoxia. This model simulated the action potential (AP) propagations of endocardial, midmycardial and epicardial cells with different levels of ischemia, and the influence of each factor on cell AP was analyzed. Finally the ECG waveform under ischemia was quantified by using a 2D model of human left ventricular tissue based on the anatomical structure of human heart. The experimental results showed that under ischemia action potential durations (APD) were reduced. In most cases, the larger the size of ischemic region or the more severe the ischemic level, the more dramatic the changes in the amplitude of ST-T wave were observed. For the three components of ischemia, hyperkalaemia was the dominant contributor to ST-T wave changes, which was in agreement with the results obtained on animal models.

Stochastic relationships for periodic responses in randomly heterogeneous aquifers
The aim of this work is to develop a theoretical framework for the analysis of groundwater head oscillations commonly observed in bores near boundaries of surface water bodies that are subject to periodic variations in stage height. Restricting attention to the linear groundwater flow equation, the dynamics of head variations induced by periodic modes acting at boundaries are governed by a complex-valued time-independent equation parameterized by the modal frequency of interest. For randomly heterogeneous aquifers the hydraulic conductivity field may be regarded as a spatial random variable. Stochastic relationships between the conductivity spectrum and the induced head oscillation spectrum are generated from a stochastic perturbation approach. Spatial correlative relationships are derived for several stochastic models incorporating up to three spatial dimensions. Explicit calculations of head oscillation autocovariances and spectral densities are parameterized by conductivity statistics, including integral scale and variance, and by modal frequency. The results show that time domain head responses to periodic boundary forcing are strongly dependent on multidimensional effects and on spatial correlation structure. Computational simulations show that the stochastic variance estimators match simulated head fluctuation variances for a range of modal frequencies and aquifer diffusivities and that joint inversion of conductivity integral scale and variance is possible with moderate numbers of sampling points.

Production of germ tubes by virulent and attenuated strains of Candida albicans.
Two strains (no. 19321 and no. 19273) of Candida albicans that were obtained from patients with vaginal thrush and were virulent for mice formed germ tubes after incubation in fresh mouse serum and mouse kidney extract more rapidly and to a greater extent than did two strains (no. 22114 and no. 21462) that were isolated from patients with transient candidemia and were attenuated for mice. After incubation in fresh human serum, the strain differences in germination were not as marked although the pattern was similar. Synchronous cultures of strains no. 19321 and no. 22114 showed differences similar to those shown by asynchronous cultures in the mouse and human sera and in the mouse kidney extract. The viability of the strains was maintained in all three types of media; thus, nonspecific humoral defense mechanisms had little effect on the attenuated strain.

A modeling approach to evaluate the uncertainty in estimating the evaporation behaviour and volatility of organic aerosols
The uncertainty in determining the volatility behaviour of organic particles from thermograms using calibration curves and a kinetic model has been evaluated. In the analysis, factors such as re-condensation, departure from equilibrium and analysis methodology were considered as potential sources of uncertainty in deriving volatility distribution from thermograms obtained with currently used thermodenuder designs. The previously found empirical relationship between C{*} (saturation concentration) and T-50 (temperature at which 50\% of aerosol mass evaporates) was theoretically interpreted and tested to infer volatility distributions from experimental thermograms. The presented theoretical analysis shows that this empirical equation is in fact an equilibrium formulation, whose applicability is lessened as measurements deviate from equilibrium. While using a calibration curve between C{*} and T-50 to estimate volatility properties was found to hold at equilibrium, significant underestimation was obtained under kinetically-controlled evaporation conditions. Because thermograms obtained at ambient aerosol loading levels are most likely to show departure from equilibrium, the application of a kinetic evaporation model is more suitable for inferring volatility properties of atmospheric samples than the calibration curve approach; however, the kinetic model analysis implies significant uncertainty, due to its sensitivity to the assumption of `effective' net kinetic evaporation and condensation coefficients. The influence of re-condensation on thermograms from the thermodenuder designs under study was found to be highly dependent on the particular experimental condition, with a significant potential to affect volatility estimations for aerosol mass loadings > 50 mu g m(-3) and with increasing effective kinetic coefficient for condensation and decreasing particle size. These results show that the geometry of current thermodenuder systems should be modified to prevent re-condensation.

[cough, objective, subjective]

Chronic cough: how do cough reflex sensitivity and subjective assessments correlate with objective cough counts during ambulatory monitoring?
BACKGROUND: Cough reflex sensitivity, subjective estimates of cough frequency and cough-related quality of life have been used to assess cough and monitor treatment responses. The relationships between these measures and objective cough monitoring remain unclear and the usefulness of subjective assessments remains questionable. SUBJECTS: 62 patients with chronic cough (39 women) were studied. Mean age of patients was 54.9 (SD 12.2) years, with a median duration of cough of 5.5 (range 1-30) years. METHODS: Cough reflex sensitivity testing (C5; citric acid) was performed in all patients before fully ambulatory day-time and night-time cough recordings. Patients scored the frequency and severity of their cough (Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) and 0-5 score) for each recording period and completed a cough-related quality-of-life questionnaire, Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ). Ambulatory cough recordings were manually counted and reported in terms of cough seconds per hour (cs/h). Cough rates were log(10) transformed for analysis. RESULTS: The median time spent coughing was 11.36 (range 1.06-46) cs/h with median day rates of 15.59 (range 2-74.8) cs/h and median night rates of 2.94 (range 0-26.67) cs/h. An inverse relationship was seen between day cough rates and log(10) C5 (r = -0.452, p< or =0.001). Subjective cough scores and visual analogue scales were only moderately associated with objective time spent coughing, with night-time being scores more strongly associated than day-time scores. The strongest correlation with objective cough frequency was cough-related quality of life (LCQ), (r = -0.622, p< or =0.001), mediated through the psychological domain. CONCLUSIONS: Subjective measures of cough and cough reflex sensitivity are only moderately related to objective time spent coughing, and hence cannot be used as surrogate markers for objective cough-frequency measurements. Cough-related quality of life (LCQ) is most strongly related to objectively counted cough, and may be a useful adjunct to objective measures in the assessment of cough.

MLL2 mosaic mutations and intragenic deletion-duplications in patients with Kabuki syndrome.
Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a rare multi-system disorder that can result in a variety of congenital malformations, typical dysmorphism and variable learning disability. It is caused by MLL2 point mutations in the majority of the cases and, rarely by deletions involving KDM6A. Nearly one third of cases remain unsolved. Here, we expand the known genetic basis of KS by presenting five typical patients with the condition, all of whom have novel MLL2 mutation types- two patients with mosaic small deletions, one with a mosaic whole-gene deletion, one with a multi-exon deletion and one with an intragenic multi-exon duplication. We recommend MLL2 dosage studies for all patients with typical KS, where traditional Sanger sequencing fails to identify mutations. The prevalence of such MLL2 mutations in KS may be comparable with deletions involving KDM6A. These findings may be helpful in understanding the mutational mechanism of MLL2 and the disease mechanism of KS.

Prevention and monitoring of invasive fungal infections in pediatric patients with cancer and hematologic disorders.
BACKGROUND: The occurrence of invasive fungal infection (IFIs) in a pediatric hematology/oncology unit after renovation of the ventilation system, and initiating routine azole antifungal prophylaxis was monitored. In addition, the value of serial screening for Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis was assessed. PROCEDURE: A total of 98 consecutive high-risk pediatric patients were prospectively surveyed for signs of IFI and weekly monitored for serum GM. The data was not made available to treating physicians. RESULTS: Only 2 patients had proven and 27 possible IFI based on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group definitions. The incidence of proven IFI was 1/31 (3.2%) in the allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) (Aspergillus spp), 0/26 in the autologous SCT, and 1/60 (1.6%) in the induction therapy group (C. krusei). GM was detected at least in one tested sample in 12/98 patients (12.2%), in five patients in two or more sequential samples. In the latter group, IFI was proven in one patient and could not be excluded in the others. Four of the five patients belonged to the 31 allogeneic and one to the 26 autologous SCT patients. In patients with only one positive GM test none developed signs of IFI and only one received empirical amphotericin B. CONCLUSIONS: With the currently used preventative and prophylactic measures, IFI is uncommon in children with high-risk for infection. Regular screening for GM could be useful among allogeneic SCT patients and two positive samples should prompt further investigative procedures and pre-emptive antifungal therapy.

Design and Control of UAV Systems: A Tri-Rotor UAV Case Study
The field of UAV systems is an active research area with potential for development and enhancement in various perspectives. This thesis investigates different issues related to the design, operation and control of UAV systems with a focus on the application side of each proposed solution where the implementation side and applicability of the proposed solutions are always considered with high priority. The thesis discusses unmodeled actuator dynamics and their effect on UAV systems when using feedback linearisation to linearize nonlinear models of UAVs. The analysis shows potential risk when implementing feedback linearisation and neglecting actuator dynamics even for first order actuator system. A solution algorithm of two stage feedback linearisation is proposed to handle actuator dynamics and linearize the main dynamics of the system. In the field of design and operation of UAVs, this thesis proposes a systematic design procedure for electric propulsion systems that are widely used in UAVs. The design procedure guides the designer step by step to achieve minimum propulsion system weight or maximum flight time or a trade off between the two factors from the supplied solution sets. On the navigation side, the thesis proposes a new indoor navigation system that is easy to implement and less costly compared with other indoor navigation systems. The proposed system can be classified under computer-vision based navigation systems, however, it needs less information and less computational capacity. The thesis also contributes to the structure design of UAV systems by producing a novel tri-rotor UAV platform. The proposed UAV is novel in structure and design and has a centralized control system that stabilizes and tracks both rotational and transitional motion of the vehicle simultaneously.

Curly-tail mice with neural tube defects show abnormal cortical development
BackgroundOur past work suggests a vital role for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in normal cortical development. Abnormal cortical development occurs from the earliest stages following fluid obstruction in the developing brain of a hydrocephalic fetus. Here, we studied development of the cerebral cortex in the curly-tail mouse model of neural tube defects (NTDs). Curly tail litters exhibit a variety of NTDs including exencephaly and spina bifida. A proportion of littermates have no apparent defect. Materials and methodsHomozygous curly-tail mice were time-mated and injected with 2, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 60 mg/kg) on day E17. Fetuses were harvested on day E19 and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. After cryoprotection in 20% sucrose, whole fetuses were sectioned at 25 μm on a Leica cryostat. Sections were air dried before immunocytochemical staining with anti-BrdU antibody (Nova Castro, UK). Images were taken on a Leica DMLB microscope using a Coolsnap camera (Princeton Instruments) and Metaview Software (Universal Imaging). ResultsCurly tail fetuses with exencephaly showed almost total degeneration of the cortex, as a result of exposure of the neuroepithelium to amniotic fluid. Among curly-tail fetuses with a closed brain, all but one showed abnormal migration of BrdU labelled cells. This varied from no apparent migration from the germinal epithelium to a random pattern of stained cells throughout the different zones of the cortex. This compared to the laminar distribution of labelled cells at the top of the cortex, adjacent to the marginal zone, in normal control mice. ConclusionWhile exencephaly is associated with degeneration of the neuroepithelium, mice with a genetic predisposition to neural tube defects show abnormal development of the cerebral cortex, specifically with disturbance of the migration of cells from the germinal zone into the developing cortex.

Modeling of MV vacuum circuit breakers with prestrike characteristics for simulation of transient studies for wind farm networks
AbstractVacuum Circuit Breakers are widely used in medium voltage (MV) networks for making and breaking of circuits under normal or abnormal circuit condition. The making or switching-on operation of circuit breaker during energization of wind farm networks can cause switching transients which might damage the insulation structure of cables, transformers and turbine generators. The repetitive impact on the systems without remedial action may cause premature ageing of the above mentioned components. The aim of this paper is to model medium voltage vacuum circuit breakers in order to simulate prestrike phenomena accurately. A three phase network and circuit model will be developed. It will be developed in ATP environment using MODELS, a symbolic language implemented in the ATPDraw software package. The model includes the derivatives of voltage and current, high frequency chopping current, breakdown characteristic of contact gaps and travelling time of closing contacts. The validation of the simulation results in terms of voltage and current under prestrike conditions will be also presented. The proposed circuit breaker model can be incorporated in any study related to development of computer based testing facilities for testing protection schemes, protective numerical algorithms etc.

FTIR microspectroscopy of selected rare diverse sub-variants of carcinoma of the  urinary bladder
Urothelial carcinomas of the bladder are a heterogeneous group of tumours,although some histological sub-variants are rare and sparsely reported in theliterature. Diagnosis of sub-variants from conventional urothelial carcinoma can be challenging, as they may mimic the morphology of other malignancies or benign tumours and therefore their distinction is important. For the first time, thespectral pathology of some of these sub-variants has been documented by infrared microspectroscopy and an attempt made to profile their biochemistry. It isimportant not only to identify and separate the cancer-associated epithelialtissue spectra from common tissue features such as stroma or blood, but also todetect the signatures of tumour sub-variants. As shown, their spectroscopicsignals can change dramatically as a consequence of differentiation. Examplecases are discussed and compared with histological evaluations.

Detection and quantification of bacterial spoilage in milk and pork meat using MALDI-TOF-MS and multivariate analysis.
Microbiological safety is one of the cornerstones of quality control in the food industry. Identification and quantification of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized milk and meat in the food industry currently relies on accurate and sensitive yet time-consuming techniques which give retrospective values for microbial contamination. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), a proven technique in the field of protein and peptide identification and quantification, may be a valuable alternative approach for the rapid assessment of microbial spoilage. In this work we therefore developed MALDI-TOF-MS as a novel analytical approach for the assessment of food that when combined with chemometrics allows for the detection and quantification of milk and pork meat spoilage bacteria. To develop this approach, natural spoilage of pasteurized milk and raw pork meat samples incubated at 15 °C and at room temperature, respectively, was conducted. Samples were collected for MALDI-TOF-MS analysis (which took 4 min per sample) at regular time intervals throughout the spoilage process, with concurrent calculation and documentation of reference total viable counts using traditional microbiological methods (these took 2 days). Multivariate statistical techniques such as principal component discriminant function analysis, canonical correlation analysis, partial least-squares (PLS) regression, and kernel PLS (KPLS) were used to analyze the data. The results from MALDI-TOF-MS combined with PLS or KPLS gave excellent bacterial quantification results for both milk and meat spoilage, and typical root mean squared errors for prediction in test spectra were between 0.53 and 0.79 log unit. Overall these novel findings strongly indicate that MALDI-TOF-MS when combined with chemometric approaches would be a useful adjunct for routine use in the milk and meat industry as a fast and accurate viable bacterial detection and quantification method.

A prevalence and morphometrical studies was conducted on Cysticercus tenuicollis infection in slaughter sheep and goats in Maiduguri. A total of 507 animals comprising 236 sheep and 271 goats were examined at slaughter revealing a prevalence of 169(71.6%) and 195 (71.9%) respectively. Age wise prevalence revealed higher infection in the age group above 4 years with 90% in sheep and 81.6% in goats, while those below 4 years had 68.9% in sheep and 69.8% in goats. Sex wise, female animals had higher prevalence of 74.6% in sheep and 73.4% in goats than the male with 64.8% in sheep and 70.3% in goats. Breed wise indicated a higher prevalence among Sudanis sheep (83.9%) than Yankasa (72.1%), Balami (71.4%), Ouda (70.1%) and Koroji (59.9%) (p&lt;0.05); while in goats the West Africa Dwarf (WAD) had 75.7% and the Sahel breed (69.2%) (p&lt;0.05). Based on predilection site, there was a higher prevalence for the omentum in sheep (37.3%) and goats (51.3%) than the mesentery (36.7%) in sheep, 27.2% in goats; serosal surface of the liver (14.2%) in sheep and (9.7%) in goats, and peritoneal cavity (11.8%) in sheep and (11.8%) in goats. Morphometrical studies indicated a mean &plusmn; SD (range) diameter (cm) of 4.18&plusmn;1.38 (5-7) for cysticerci in sheep, and 4.25&plusmn;1.42 (1-7) in goats and length of the cysticerci neck as 0.95&plusmn; 0.94 (1-3.7) in sheep and 0.95&plusmn; 0.85 (1-3.5) in goats. These values were not statistically significant (p&gt;0.05). Appropriate and adequate control schemes need to be implemented to decimate the prevalence of cysticerci in sheep and goats. &nbsp; KEYWORDS: Cysticercus tenuicollis, Infection, Sheep, Goats, Nigeria

Free-standing graphene at atomic resolution
Research interest in graphene, a two-dimensional crystal consisting of a single atomic plane of carbon atoms, has been driven by its extraordinary properties, including charge carriers that mimic ultra-relativistic elementary particles. Moreover, graphene exhibits ballistic electron transport on the submicrometre scale, even at room temperature, which has allowed the demonstration of graphene-based field-effect transistors and the observation of a room-temperature quantum Hall effect. Here we confirm the presence of free-standing, single-layer graphene with directly interpretable atomic-resolution imaging combined with the spatially resolved study of both the pi -> pi{*} transition and the pi + sigma plasmon. We also present atomic-scale observations of the morphology of free-standing graphene and explore the role of microstructural peculiarities that affect the stability of the sheets. We also follow the evolution and interaction of point defects and suggest a mechanism by which they form ring defects.

Dual purpose S-trityl-linkers for glycoarray fabrication on both polystyrene and gold
There is a wide range of immobilisation reactions to tether substrates to a variety of surfaces for array-based analysis. Most of these immobilisation strategies are speciﬁc for a particular surface and require an additional linker to be attached to the substrate or the surface. Furthermore, the analysis of functionalised surfaces is often restricted to certain analytical techniques and therefore, different immobilisation strategies for different surfaces are desirable. Here we have tested an S-tritylated linker for non-covalent or covalent immobilisation of mannosides to polystyrene or gold surfaces. S-Tritylated mannosides with varying linkers were readily synthesised and used to add to biorepulsive maleimideterminated preformed SAMs after in situ deprotection of the S-trityl group. In addition, S-tritylated mannosides themselves formed stable glycoarrays on polystyrene microtiter plates. The glycoarrays were successfully analysed by MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry, SPR spectroscopy, and interrogated with GFP-transfected Escherichia coli cells. This work has shown that a dual purpose linker can be used on multiple surfaces to form arrays allowing for different testing as well as analytical approaches.

Evaluation and Prognostic Significance of Circulating Tumor Cells in Patients With Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer
PURPOSE: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) lacks validated biomarkers to predict treatment response. This study investigated whether circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are detectable in patients with NSCLC and what their ability might be to provide prognostic information and/or early indication of patient response to conventional therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this single-center prospective study, blood samples for CTC analysis were obtained from 101 patients with previously untreated, stage III or IV NSCLC both before and after administration of one cycle of standard chemotherapy. CTCs were measured using a semiautomated, epithelial cell adhesion molecule-based immunomagnetic technique. RESULTS: The number of CTCs in 7.5 mL of blood was higher in patients with stage IV NSCLC (n = 60; range, 0 to 146) compared with patients with stage IIIB (n = 27; range, 0 to 3) or IIIA disease (n = 14; no CTCs detected). In univariate analysis, progression-free survival was 6.8 v 2.4 months with P < .001, and overall survival (OS) was 8.1 v 4.3 months with P < .001 for patients with fewer than five CTCs compared with five or more CTCs before chemotherapy, respectively. In multivariate analysis, CTC number was the strongest predictor of OS (hazard ratio HR, 7.92; 95% CI, 2.85 to 22.01; P < .001), and the point estimate of the HR was increased with incorporation of a second CTC sample that was taken after one cycle of chemotherapy (HR, 15.65; 95% CI, 3.63 to 67.53; P < .001). CONCLUSION: CTCs are detectable in patients with stage IV NSCLC and are a novel prognostic factor for this disease. Further validation is warranted before routine clinical application.

The influence of magma supply and eruptive processes on axial morphology, crustal construction and magma chambers
Two-thirds of the surface of the Earth is created at mid-ocean ridges where magmas
rise from the mantle and cool to form the oceanic crust. The objective of this Thesis is to
examine the influence of magma supply and eruptive processes on axial morphology,
crustal construction, and the properties of crustal magma chambers at intermediate and fast
spreading ridges. Variations in magma supply on time scales of ~100 Kyr generate along-axis
changes in crustal thickness and temperature. Magma sill properties and hydrothermal
activity are closely linked to spreading events which occur on much shorter time scales (ca.
10-100 yr) than the longer-term variations in magma supply reflected in along-axis changes
in ridge morphology. The seismically constrained depths of ridge crest magma sills (>1-2
km) are considerably deeper than the level of neutral buoyancy (100-400 m). The apparent
inverse relationship between magma sill depth and spreading rate suggests that a thermally
controlled permeability boundary, such as the solidus horizon, controls the depth at which
magma ponds beneath mid-ocean ridges. Recent thermo-mechanical models predict that, at
intermediate spreading rates, rift valley and magma sill formation are sensitive to small
changes in crustal thickness and mantle temperature. Analysis of gravity at an intermediate
spreading ridge shows that small differences in crustal thickness (300-700 m) and mantle temperature (10-15°C) are indeed sufficient to produce major changes in lithospheric
strength and axial morphology. A stochastic model for the emplacement of dikes and lava
flows with a bimodal distribution of lava flows is required to satisfy geological and
geophysical constraints on the construction of the extrusive section. Most dikes are
intruded within a narrow zone at the ridge axis. Short flows build up approximately half
the extrusive volume. Occasional flows that pond at a considerable distance off-axis build
up the remainder of the extrusive section. This Thesis underlines the importance of
eruption dynamics in the emplacement of the uppermost volcanic layer of the crust and of
the crustal thermal structure in controlling local variations in magma sill depth and ridge
morphology.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution December 199

Neuroglia at the crossroads of homoeostasis, metabolism and signalling: evolution of the concept.
Ever since Rudolf Virchow in 1858 publicly announced his apprehension of neuroglia being a true connective substance, this concept has been evolving to encompass a heterogeneous population of cells with various forms and functions. We briefly compare the 19th-20th century perspectives on neuroglia with the up-to-date view of these cells as an integral, and possibly integrating, component of brain metabolism and signalling in heath and disease. We conclude that the unifying property of otherwise diverse functions of various neuroglial cell sub-types is to maintain brain homoeostasis at different levels, from whole organ to molecular.

Complete Mitochondrial Genome Sequence from a Mesolithic Wild Aurochs (Bos primigenius)
BackgroundThe derivation of domestic cattle from the extinct wild aurochs (Bos primigenius) has been well-documented by archaeological and genetic studies. Genetic studies point towards the Neolithic Near East as the centre of origin for Bos taurus, with some lines of evidence suggesting possible, albeit rare, genetic contributions from locally domesticated wild aurochsen across Eurasia. Inferences from these investigations have been based largely on the analysis of partial mitochondrial DNA sequences generated from modern animals, with limited sequence data from ancient aurochsen samples. Recent developments in DNA sequencing technologies, however, are affording new opportunities for the examination of genetic material retrieved from extinct species, providing new insight into their evolutionary history. Here we present DNA sequence analysis of the first complete mitochondrial genome (16,338 base pairs) from an archaeologically-verified and exceptionally-well preserved aurochs bone sample.MethodologyDNA extracts were generated from an aurochs humerus bone sample recovered from a cave site located in Derbyshire, England and radiocarbon-dated to 6,738±68 calibrated years before present. These extracts were prepared for both Sanger and next generation DNA sequencing technologies (Illumina Genome Analyzer). In total, 289.9 megabases (22.48%) of the post-filtered DNA sequences generated using the Illumina Genome Analyzer from this sample mapped with confidence to the bovine genome. A consensus B. primigenius mitochondrial genome sequence was constructed and was analysed alongside all available complete bovine mitochondrial genome sequences.ConclusionsFor all nucleotide positions where both Sanger and Illumina Genome Analyzer sequencing methods gave high-confidence calls, no discrepancies were observed. Sequence analysis reveals evidence of heteroplasmy in this sample and places this mitochondrial genome sequence securely within a previously identified aurochsen haplogroup (haplogroup P), thus providing novel insights into pre-domestic patterns of variation. The high proportion of authentic, endogenous aurochs DNA preserved in this sample bodes well for future efforts to determine the complete genome sequence of a wild ancestor of domestic cattle.

Effectiveness of enhanced communication therapy in the first four months after stroke for aphasia and dysarthria: a randomised controlled trial
OBJECTIVE:To assess the effectiveness of enhanced communication therapy in the first four months after stroke compared with an attention control (unstructured social contact).DESIGN:Externally randomised, pragmatic, parallel, superiority trial with blinded outcome assessment.SETTING:Twelve UK hospital and community stroke services.PARTICIPANTS:170 adults (mean age 70 years) randomised within two weeks of admission to hospital with stroke (December 2006 to January 2010) whom speech and language therapists deemed eligible, and 135 carers.INTERVENTIONS:Enhanced, agreed best practice, communication therapy specific to aphasia or dysarthria, offered by speech and language therapists according to participants' needs for up to four months, with continuity from hospital to community. Comparison was with similarly resourced social contact (without communication therapy) from employed visitors.OUTCOME MEASURES:Primary outcome was blinded, functional communicative ability at six months on the Therapy Outcome Measure (TOM) activity subscale. Secondary outcomes (unblinded, six months): participants' perceptions on the Communication Outcomes After Stroke scale (COAST); carers' perceptions of participants from part of the Carer COAST; carers' wellbeing on Carers of Older People in Europe Index and quality of life items from Carer COAST; and serious adverse events.RESULTS:Therapist and visitor contact both had good uptake from service users. An average 22 contacts (intervention or control) over 13 weeks were accepted by users. Impairment focused therapy was the approach most often used by the speech and language therapists. Visitors most often provided general conversation. In total, 81/85 of the intervention group and 72/85 of the control group completed the primary outcome measure. Both groups improved on the TOM activity subscale. The estimated six months group difference was not statistically significant, with 0.25 (95% CI -0.19 to 0.69) points in favour of therapy. Sensitivity analyses that adjusted for chance baseline imbalance further reduced this difference. Per protocol analyses rejected a possible dilution of treatment effect from controls declining their allocation and receiving usual care. There was no added benefit of therapy on secondary outcome measures, subgroup analyses (such as aphasia), or serious adverse events, although the latter were less common after intervention (odds ratio 0.42 (95% CI 0.16 to 1.1)).CONCLUSIONS:Communication therapy had no added benefit beyond that from everyday communication in the first four months after stroke. Future research should evaluate reorganised services that support functional communication practice early in the stroke pathway.

[mitochondrial, cancer, cell, tumor, growth, pgc-1, biogenesis]

Mitochondrial biogenesis in epithelial cancer cells promotes breast cancer tumor growth and confers autophagy resistance.
Here, we set out to test the novel hypothesis that increased mitochondrial biogenesis in epithelial cancer cells would "fuel" enhanced tumor growth. For this purpose, we generated MDA-MB-231 cells (a triple-negative human breast cancer cell line) overexpressing PGC-1α and MitoNEET, which are established molecules that drive mitochondrial biogenesis and increased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Interestingly, both PGC-1α and MitoNEET increased the abundance of OXPHOS protein complexes, conferred autophagy resistance under conditions of starvation and increased tumor growth by up to ~3-fold. However, this increase in tumor growth was independent of neo-angiogenesis, as assessed by immunostaining and quantitation of vessel density using CD31 antibodies. Quantitatively similar increases in tumor growth were also observed by overexpression of PGC-1β and POLRMT in MDA-MB-231 cells, which are also responsible for mediating increased mitochondrial biogenesis. Thus, we propose that increased mitochondrial "power" in epithelial cancer cells oncogenically promotes tumor growth by conferring autophagy resistance. As such, PGC-1α, PGC-1β, mitoNEET and POLRMT should all be considered as tumor promoters or "metabolic oncogenes." Our results are consistent with numerous previous clinical studies showing that metformin (a weak mitochondrial "poison") prevents the onset of nearly all types of human cancers in diabetic patients. Therefore, metformin (a complex I inhibitor) and other mitochondrial inhibitors should be developed as novel anticancer therapies, targeting mitochondrial metabolism in cancer cells.

On the role of dislocation loops in silicon light emitting diodes
<p>The role of boron-induced dislocation loops on the suppression of the luminescence thermal quenching in silicon-based light-emitting diodes is investigated here. Luminescence measurements and cross-sectional transmission-electron-microscopy images from devices fabricated by boron implantation into crystalline silicon, and into a pre-amorphized substrate, to prevent the boron-induced loops formation, were compared. The results show that, in the devices incorporating dislocation loops between the depletion region and sample surface (the boron induced loops), the thermal quenching has been completely eliminated, in contrast with devices fabricated from the pre-amorphized substrate where strong thermal quenching is still observed.</p>

School staff perceptions of well-being and experience of an intervention to promote mental well-being
AbstractEducational Psychologists (EPs) spend much of their time working with school staff to solve problems. Staff often report perceptions of high levels of stress, overwork and lack of time to plan and implement changes indicating frequent experience of poor mental well-being. There has been a recent increase in awareness of promoting the well-being of children and young people, however, little attention appears to have been focused as yet upon the school staff who will promote and support this agenda.Research in schools has tended to focus on teachers rather than including all staff. There is a preponderance of research clarifying contributors to teachers’ stress and, to a lesser extent describing interventions in schools. However, little research has focused on school staff understanding and value of well-being and about perceptions of interventions carried out in schools. This study aimed to obtain a greater understanding of the perceptions of school staff about well-being, the value they placed upon it and the experience and perceived impact of taking part in a study aiming to promote staff well-being. An 8 week intervention was carried out in a primary school with weekly sessions of a project which was known as ‘Chill and Chat’. Data was gathered via questionnaires completed before and after the project and 3 focus groups held before, during and after the project. Data was analysed using thematic analysis.It was found that well-being was seen as important, however, colleagues with poor mental well-being were ‘pathologised’. ‘Learning’ to cope and maintain positive well-being was perceived as a responsibility of the staff member. Staff perceived the informality of provision to support their well-being as important and valued the time to develop better relationships with colleagues rather than ‘working relationships’ and also feeling valued and cared for. Staff reported perceptions of greater efficacy in the classroom, increased job satisfaction and feeling calmer in the classroom. The most significant limitation of the study was the continuation of provision to support staff mental well-being which requires commitment and understanding from school senior management teams and local authority members regarding the impact that increased well being can have on teaching and learning and a shift of thought towards focusing on positive well-being promotion rather than managing poor well-being.There are implications for EP practice and research in helping school staff reflect on their well-being and actions that they can take as a team to promote well-being in school. EPs can also be instrumental in disseminating research findings highlighting the impact of staff mental well being on teaching and learning.

Local signals with global impacts and clinical implications: lessons from the plasma membrane calcium pump (PMCA4).
Calcium has been unequivocally regarded as a key signal messenger in almost every cell type. Calcium regulates a number of important cellular functions including cell growth, myofilament contraction, cell survival and apoptosis as well as gene transcription. A complex regulatory mechanism of cellular calcium is needed to fine tune the precise calcium concentration in each subcellular location and also to transmit the signals carried by the calcium pool to the correct end target. In this article we will review the recently emerging role of the plasma membrane calcium/calmodulin dependent ATPase isoform 4 (PMCA4) in regulating calcium signalling. We will then focus on the function of this molecule in cardiomyocytes, in which PMCA4 forms protein-protein interactions with several key signalling molecules. Recent evidence has shown in vivo physiological functionalities and possible clinical implications of the PMCA4 signalling complex.

The influence of surgical excision margins on keloid prognosis.
Keloid disease is known to have variable clinical behavior in response to therapy and there is no clinicopathologic classification that predicts such varied behavior. The aim of this study was to study the effect of excision margins and other histopathologic characteristics on keloid prognosis.Seventy-five multiethnic patients presenting with keloid scars at a department of plastic and reconstructive surgery during an 11-year period were included in this study. Clinical data was collected and detailed histologic analyses using light microscopy were carried out on archived patient specimens.A detailed histopathologic examination of all tissue samples identified keloid border or margin characteristics which were classified into "circumscribed" (borders clearly-demarcated) and "infiltrative" (borders not clearly-demarcated and not easily-definable). The specific histologic findings were correlated with keloid recurrence which revealed that incomplete peripheral (P < 0.001) and deep excision margins (P < 0.001), as well as infiltrative borders (P < 0.05) were associated with higher 1-year reported recurrence rates.This study has given evidence that incomplete surgical excision are associated with higher recurrence and this may justify the practice of routine histopathologic reporting of keloid excision margins.

Persistent Candida albicans colonization and molecular mechanisms of azole resistance in autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) patients.
OBJECTIVES: Patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED, APS-I) suffer from chronic candidosis caused mainly by Candida albicans, and repeated courses of azole antifungals have led to the development of resistance in the APECED patient population in Finland. The aim of our study was to address whether the patients are persistently colonized with the same or genetically closely related strains, whether epidemic strains are present and which molecular mechanisms account for azole resistance. METHODS: Sets of C. albicans (n = 19) isolates from nine APECED patients reported with decreased susceptibility to fluconazole isolated up to 9 years apart were included. The strains were typed by multilocus sequence typing. CDR1/2, MDR1 and ERG11 mRNA expression was analysed by northern blotting and Cdr1, Cdr2 and Mdr1 protein expression by western blotting, and TAC1 and ERG11 genes were sequenced. RESULTS: All seven patients with multiple C. albicans isolates analysed were persistently colonized with the same or a genetically closely related strain for a mean of 5 years. All patients were colonized with different strains and no epidemic strains were found. The major molecular mechanisms behind the azole resistance were mutations in TAC1 contributing to overexpression of CDR1 and CDR2. Six new TAC1 mutations were found, one of which (N740S) is likely to be a gain-of-function mutation. Most isolates were found to have gained multiple TAC1 and ERG11 point mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Despite clinically successful treatment leading to relief of symptoms, colonization by C. albicans strains is persistent within APECED patients. Microevolution and point mutations occur within strains, leading to the development of azole-resistant isolates.

In this manner, C-allyl mannopyranosides were obtained in39-60% yields, with α:β 4:1 anomeric selectivity for 3-(2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-α,β-Dmannopyranosyl)propene, while 3-(2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzyl-α-D-mannopyranosyl) propenewas produced exclusively as the α-anomer.Sulfur-linked carbohydrates were successfully synthesised in the presence of 1,1′-azobis(cyclohexanecarbonitrile) as radical initiator via the thiol-ene click reaction. Each reaction afforded the corresponding sulfide spacer-arm glycosides in good yields. An efficient two-step methodology has been developed for the synthesis of the novel primary thiol group-containing sugars, (2R,3S,4R,5R,6R)-2-(acetoxymethyl)-6-(3- mercaptopropyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3,4,5-triyl triacetate and 3-((2R,3R,4R,5S,6R)-3,4,5- tris(benzyloxy)-6-((benzyloxy)methyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)propane-1-thiol. In this way, free thiol group-containing sugars were obtained in 73% and 60% yields respectively, with an anomeric ratio of α:β 2.5:1 for (2R,3S,4R,5R,6R)-2-(acetoxymethyl)-6-(3- mercaptopropyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3,4,5-triyl triacetate and 3-((2R,3R,4R,5S,6R)-3,4,5-tris(benzyloxy)-6-((benzyloxy)methyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)propane-1-thiol being obtained as the α-anomer only. The thiol-ene click reaction was thus shown to be a viable method to obtain novel free thiolcontainingC-glycosides. These compounds are suitable for future applications towards asmultivalent saccharides via the use of the primary thiol function for click thiol-eneconjugations, or other S-based conjugation chemistry.

The efficacy of aerosol treatment with non-ionic surfactant vesicles containing amphotericin B in rodent models of leishmaniasis and pulmonary aspergillosis infection.
Amphotericin B (AMB) is used to treat both fungal and leishmanial infections, which are of major significance to human health. Clinical use of free AMB is limited by its nephrotoxicity, whereas liposomal AMB is costly and requires parenteral administration, thus development of novel formulations with enhanced efficacy, minimal toxicity and that can be applied via non-invasive routes is required. In this study we analysed the potential of non-ionic surfactant vesicles (NIV) given by nebulisation to deliver AMB to the lungs, liver and skin. Treatment with AMB-NIV resulted in significantly higher drug levels in the lungs and skin (p<0.05) compared to similar treatment with AMB solution but significantly lower plasma levels (p<0.05). Treatment with AMB-NIV resulted in a significant reduction in fungal lung burdens in a rat model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (p<0.05) compared to treatment with the carrier alone. Treatment with AMB-NIV but not AMB solution significantly suppressed Leishmania donovani liver parasite burdens (p<0.05) but could not inhibit the growth of cutaneous Leishmania major lesions. The results of this study indicate that aerosolised NIV enhanced pulmonary and hepatic delivery whilst minimising systemic exposure and toxicity.

Dermal substitute-assisted healing: enhancing stem cell therapy with novel biomaterial design.
The use of dermal substitutes is increasingly widespread but the outcomes of substitute-assisted healing remain functionally deficient. Presently, the most successful scaffolds are acellular polymer matrices, prepared through lyophilization and phase separation techniques, designed to mimic the dermal extracellular matrix. The application of scaffolds containing viable cells has proven to be problematic due to short shelf-life, high cost and death of transplanted cells as a result of immune rejection and apoptosis. Recent advances in biomaterial science have made new techniques available capable of increasing scaffold complexity, allowing the creation of 3D microenvironments that actively control cell behaviour. Importantly, it may be possible through these sophisticated novel techniques, including bio-printing and electrospinning, to accurately direct stem cell behaviour. This complex proposal involves the incorporation of cell-matrix, cell-cell, mechanical cues and soluble factors delivered in a spatially and temporally pertinent manner. This requires accurate modelling of three-dimensional stem cell interactions within niche environments to identify key signalling molecules and mechanisms. The application of stem cells within substitutes containing such environments may result in greatly improved transplanted cell viability. Ultimately this may increase cellular organization and complexity of skin substitutes. This review discusses progress made in improving the efficacy of cellular dermal substitutes for the treatment of cutaneous defects and the potential of evolving new technology to improve current results.

[cav-3, t78k, mutation, wt, t78m, protein]

Caveolin-3 T78M and T78K missense mutations lead to different phenotypes in vivo and in vitro.
Caveolins are the principal protein components of caveolae, invaginations of the plasma membrane involved in cell signaling and trafficking. Caveolin-3 (Cav-3) is the muscle-specific isoform of the caveolin family and mutations in the CAV3 gene lead to a large group of neuromuscular disorders. In unrelated patients, we identified two distinct CAV3 mutations involving the same codon 78. Patient 1, affected by dilated cardiomyopathy and limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)-1C, shows an autosomal recessive mutation converting threonine to methionine (T78M). Patient 2, affected by isolated familiar hyperCKemia, shows an autosomal dominant mutation converting threonine to lysine (T78K). Cav-3 wild type (WT) and Cav-3 mutations were transiently transfected into Cos-7 cells. Cav-3 WT and Cav-3 T78M mutant localized at the plasma membrane, whereas Cav-3 T78K was retained in a perinuclear compartment. Cav-3 T78K expression was decreased by 87% when compared with Cav-3 WT, whereas Cav-3 T78M protein levels were unchanged. To evaluate whether Cav-3 T78K and Cav-3 T78M mutants behaved with a dominant negative pattern, Cos-7 cells were cotransfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Cav-3 WT in combination with either mutant or WT Cav-3. When cotransfected with Cav-3 WT or Cav-3 T78M, GFP-Cav-3 WT was localized at the plasma membrane, as expected. However, when cotransfected with Cav-3 T78K, GFP-Cav-3 WT was retained in a perinuclear compartment, and its protein levels were reduced by 60%, suggesting a dominant negative action. Accordingly, Cav-3 protein levels in muscles from a biopsy of patient 2 (T78K mutation) were reduced by 80%. In conclusion, CAV3 T78M and T78K mutations lead to distinct disorders showing different clinical features and inheritance, and displaying distinct phenotypes in vitro.

Introduction: the Reception of Ancient Inscriptions
This introduction opens with an exploration of the modern organisation of epigraphical knowledge, considering its relationship to both antiquarianism and scholarship and its relationship to the subject of the current book, epigraphical references in ancient literary texts. The current fragmentation of the study of ‘literary epigraphy’ calls for a volume which will bring together literary, historical and epigraphical approaches to the subject. The subject of ‘literary epigraphy’ offers much to epigraphers, ancient historians, literary scholars, but also invites us to rethink the nature of epigraphy itself: it contributes to a broader understanding of the nature and reception of epigraphy in the Graeco-Roman world. Bringing the conclusions of our contributors together, this introduction maintains that ancient encounters with inscriptions, preserved through the literary record, offer us a view of the ways in which inscriptions offered a physical and cultural backdrop for activities of all kinds; they offer us valuable insight into individuals’ reaction towards inscriptions and their manipulation of them. Both epigraphy and the idea of epigraphy offered, in antiquity, a pliable tool for claiming, maintaining and demonstrating authority, identity, morality, and power.

Eliminating a region of respiratory syncytial virus attachment protein allows induction of protective immunity without vaccine-enhanced lung eosinophilia.
In a murine model of respiratory syncytial virus disease, prior sensitization to the attachment glycoprotein (G) leads to pulmonary eosinophilia and enhanced illness. Three different approaches were taken to dissect the region of G responsible for enhanced disease and protection against challenge. First, mutant viruses, containing frameshifts that altered the COOH terminus of the G protein, were used to challenge mice sensitized by scarification with recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) expressing wild-type G. Second, cDNA expressing these mutated G proteins were expressed by rVV and used to vaccinate mice before challenge with wild-type respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). These studies identified residues 193-205 to be responsible for G-induced weight loss and lung eosinophilia and showed that this region was not was not necessary for induction of protective immunity. Third, mice were sensitized using an rVV that expressed only amino acids 124-203 of the G protein. Upon RSV challenge, mice sensitized with this rVV developed enhanced weight loss and eosinophilia. This is the first time that a region within RSV (amino acids 193-203) has been shown to be responsible for induction of lung eosinophilia and disease enhancement. Moreover, we now show that it is possible to induce protective immunity with an altered G protein without inducing a pathological response.

Repetitive sequence variation and dynamics in the ribosomal DNA array of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as revealed by whole-genome resequencing
Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) plays a key role in ribosome biogenesis, encoding genes for the structural RNA components of this important cellular organelle. These genes are vital for efficient functioning of the cellular protein synthesis machinery and as such are highly conserved and normally present in high copy numbers. In the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there are more than 100 rDNA repeats located at a single locus on chromosome XII. Stability and sequence homogeneity of the rDNA array is essential for function, and this is achieved primarily by the mechanism of gene conversion. Detecting variation within these arrays is extremely problematic due to their large size and repetitive structure. In an attempt to address this, we have analyzed over 35 Mbp of rDNA sequence obtained from whole-genome shotgun sequencing (WGSS) of 34 strains of S. cerevisiae. Contrary to expectation, we find significant rDNA sequence variation exists within individual genomes. Many of the detected polymorphisms are not fully resolved. For this type of sequence variation, we introduce the term partial single nucleotide polymorphism, or pSNP. Comparative analysis of the complete data set reveals that different S. cerevisiae genomes possess different patterns of rDNA polymorphism, with much of the variation located within the rapidly evolving nontranscribed intergenic spacer (IGS) region. Furthermore, we find that strains known to have either structured or mosaic/hybrid genomes can be distinguished from one another based on rDNA pSNP number, indicating that pSNP dynamics may provide a reliable new measure of genome origin and stability.

[muskelin, cell, morphology, ranbp9, localization, complex, activity, protein, terminus]

Novel role of the muskelin-RanBP9 complex as a nucleocytoplasmic mediator of cell morphology regulation.
The evolutionarily conserved kelch-repeat protein muskelin was identified as an intracellular mediator of cell spreading. We discovered that its morphological activity is controlled by association with RanBP9/RanBPM, a protein involved in transmembrane signaling and a conserved intracellular protein complex. By subcellular fractionation, endogenous muskelin is present in both the nucleus and the cytosol. Muskelin subcellular localization is coregulated by its C terminus, which provides a cytoplasmic restraint and also controls the interaction of muskelin with RanBP9, and its atypical lissencephaly-1 homology motif, which has a nuclear localization activity which is regulated by the status of the C terminus. Transient or stable short interfering RNA-based knockdown of muskelin resulted in protrusive cell morphologies with enlarged cell perimeters. Morphology was specifically restored by complementary DNAs encoding forms of muskelin with full activity of the C terminus for cytoplasmic localization and RanBP9 binding. Knockdown of RanBP9 resulted in equivalent morphological alterations. These novel findings identify a role for muskelin-RanBP9 complex in pathways that integrate cell morphology regulation and nucleocytoplasmic communication.

Cochlear implantation in children with cerebral palsy.
OBJECTIVE: Few studies have looked at the outcomes of children with complex needs following cochlear implantation. Increasing evidence supports the case for implantation in these children. To date there is very little evidence available evaluating the role of cochlear implantation in children with cerebral palsy. In this paper we look at the Manchester Cochlear Implant Programme's experience of implantation in 36 children with cerebral palsy. METHODS: A retrospective review of prospectively collected data for all children with cerebral palsy was undertaken. Cognitive and physical disability was scored by members of the cochlear implant team. A modified version of Geers and Moogs 1987 Speech Reception Score was used to assess outcome. Data was analysed looking at the relationship between cognitive and physical impairment, age at implantation and the SRS outcomes. RESULTS: This study demonstrated that children with cerebral palsy and a mild cognitive impairment do significantly better following implantation than those with a severe impairment (p=0.008). Children with mild physical impairment did not appear to do significantly better than those with moderate or severe impairments (mild versus severe p=0.13). Age at implantation was not a significant prognostic factor in this study group. CONCLUSIONS: Children with complex needs are increasingly being referred for consideration of cochlear implantation. Further research is required to help guide candidacy, but each case must be considered individually. Higher functioning does appear to be the most important prognostic indicator regarding outcome but the effect of modest improvement in sound perception should not be underestimated.

Thermodynamics of localized magnetic moments in a Dirac conductor
We show that the magnetic susceptibility of a dilute ensemble of magnetic impurities in a conductor with a relativistic electronic spectrum is nonanalytic in the inverse temperature at $1/T->0$. We derive a general theory of this effect and construct the high-temperature expansion for the disorder averaged susceptibility to any order, convergent at all temperatures down to a possible ordering transition. When applied to Ising impurities on a surface of a topological insulator, the proposed general theory agrees with Monte Carlo simulations, and it allows us to find the critical temperature of the ferromagnetic phase transition.

Lichen planopilaris following hair transplantation and face-lift surgery.
Cosmetic surgical procedures, including hair transplantation and face-lift surgery, are becoming increasingly popular. However, there is very little information regarding the associated development of dermatological conditions following these procedures. Lichen planopilaris (LPP) is an uncommon inflammatory hair disorder of unknown aetiology that results in permanent alopecia and replacement of hair follicles with scar-like fibrous tissue. Frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA), a variant of LPP, involves the frontal hairline and shares similar histological findings with those of LPP. We report 10 patients who developed LPP/FFA following cosmetic scalp surgery. Seven patients developed LPP following hair transplantation, and three patients developed FFA following face-lift surgery. In all cases there was no previous history of LPP or FFA. There is currently a lack of evidence to link the procedures of hair transplantation and cosmetic face-lift surgery to LPP and FFA, respectively. This is the first case series to describe this connection and to postulate the possible pathological processes underlying the clinical observation. Explanations include Koebner phenomenon induced by surgical trauma, an autoimmune process targeting an (as yet, unknown) hair follicle antigen liberated during surgery or perhaps a postsurgery proinflammatory milieu inducing hair follicle immune privilege collapse and follicular damage in susceptible individuals.

Authoring aging: Personal and social constructions
The aim of this paper is to set out some of the context for the journey I have taken as a gerontologist, reflecting both on some of the decisive ``turning points{''} and the links between personal and social constructions of aging. Along the way, the paper examines some questions about the relationship between analytical and biographical themes. The article reviews the various influences affecting my approach to issues about aging, and the contribution of these to my own thinking about critical gerontology. The latter I see as having a long gestation within my own maturing as a gerontologist, following engagement with debates in sociology and social policy. The article identifies a number of important actors and institutions that have shaped my understanding of the social, economic and political relationships underpinning old age. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

β1 Integrin NPxY Motifs Regulate Kidney Collecting Duct Development and Maintenanceby Induced-Fit Interactions with Cytosolic Proteins.
Loss of β1 integrin expression inhibits renal collecting system development. Two highly conserved NPxY motifs in the distal β1 tail regulate integrin function by associating with PTB proteins such as talin and kindlin. Here we define the role of these two tyrosines in collecting system development and delineate the structural determinants of the distal β1 tail using NMR. Mice carrying alanine mutations have moderate renal collecting system developmental abnormalities relative to β1-null mice. Phenylalanine mutations did not affect renal collecting system development but increased susceptibility to renal injury. NMR spectra in bicelles showed the distal β1 tail is disordered and does not interact with the model membrane surface. Alanine or phenylanine mutations did not alter β1 structure or interactions between ? and β1 subunit transmembrane/cytoplasmic domains; however they did decrease talin and kindlin binding. Thus these studies highlight that the functional roles of the NPxY motifs is organ dependent. Moreover, the β1 cytoplasmic tail, in the context of the adjacent transmembrane domain in bicelles, is significantly different from the more ordered, membrane associated β3 integrin tail. Finally, tyrosine mutations of β1 NPxY motifs induce phenotypes by disrupting their interactions with critical integrin binding proteins like talins and kindlins.

Ranibizumab versus bevacizumab to treat neovascular age-related macular degeneration: one-year findings from the IVAN randomized trial.
PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy and safety of ranibizumab and bevacizumab intravitreal injections to treat neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). DESIGN: Multicenter, noninferiority factorial trial with equal allocation to groups. The noninferiority limit was 3.5 letters. This trial is registered (ISRCTN92166560). PARTICIPANTS: People >50 years of age with untreated nAMD in the study eye who read ≥ 25 letters on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study chart. METHODS: We randomized participants to 4 groups: ranibizumab or bevacizumab, given either every month (continuous) or as needed (discontinuous), with monthly review. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome is at 2 years; this paper reports a prespecified interim analysis at 1 year. The primary efficacy and safety outcome measures are distance visual acuity and arteriothrombotic events or heart failure. Other outcome measures are health-related quality of life, contrast sensitivity, near visual acuity, reading index, lesion morphology, serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels, and costs. RESULTS: Between March 27, 2008 and October 15, 2010, we randomized and treated 610 participants. One year after randomization, the comparison between bevacizumab and ranibizumab was inconclusive (bevacizumab minus ranibizumab -1.99 letters, 95% confidence interval CI, -4.04 to 0.06). Discontinuous treatment was equivalent to continuous treatment (discontinuous minus continuous -0.35 letters; 95% CI, -2.40 to 1.70). Foveal total thickness did not differ by drug, but was 9% less with continuous treatment (geometric mean ratio GMR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.86 to 0.97; P = 0.005). Fewer participants receiving bevacizumab had an arteriothrombotic event or heart failure (odds ratio OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.05 to 1.07; P = 0.03). There was no difference between drugs in the proportion experiencing a serious systemic adverse event (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 0.80 to 2.27; P = 0.25). Serum VEGF was lower with bevacizumab (GMR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.54; P<0.0001) and higher with discontinuous treatment (GMR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.42; P = 0.004). Continuous and discontinuous treatment costs were £9656 and £6398 per patient per year for ranibizumab and £1654 and £1509 for bevacizumab; bevacizumab was less costly for both treatment regimens (P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The comparison of visual acuity at 1 year between bevacizumab and ranibizumab was inconclusive. Visual acuities with continuous and discontinuous treatment were equivalent. Other outcomes are consistent with the drugs and treatment regimens having similar efficacy and safety.

Systematic review and mixed treatment comparison: dressings to heal diabetic foot ulcers.
AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Foot ulcers in people with diabetes are a common and serious global health issue. Dressings form a key part of ulcer treatment. Existing systematic reviews are limited by the lack of head-to-head comparisons of alternative dressings in a field where there are several different dressing options. We aimed to determine the relative effects of alternative wound dressings on the healing of diabetic foot ulcers. METHODS: This study was a systematic review involving Bayesian mixed treatment comparison. We included randomised controlled trials evaluating the effects on diabetic foot ulcer healing of one or more wound dressings. There were no restrictions based on language or publication status. RESULTS: Fifteen eligible studies, evaluating nine dressing types, were included. Ten direct treatment comparisons were made. Whilst there was increased healing associated with hydrogel and foam dressings compared with basic wound contact materials, these findings were based on data from small studies at unclear or high risk of bias. The mixed treatment comparison suggested that hydrocolloid-matrix dressings were associated with higher odds of ulcer healing than all other dressing types; there was a high degree of uncertainty around these estimates, which were deemed to be of very low quality. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These findings summarise all available trial evidence regarding the use of dressings to heal diabetic foot ulcers. More expensive dressings may offer no advantages in terms of healing than cheaper basic dressings. In addition, evidence pointing to a difference in favour of 'advanced' dressing types over basic wound contact materials is of low or very low quality.

Embryonic expression of cholesterogenic genes is restricted to distinct domains and colocalizes with apoptotic regions in mice
Cholesterol biosynthesis has been assumed to be an ubiquitous process in vertebrate organisms. Here we present data demonstrating that expression of key enzymes of cholesterol biosynthesis is restricted to specific tissues during embryonic development. Distinct expression starts in the dorsal neural tube at embryonic day 8 and is later detected in dorsal root and cephalic ganglia, in the pharyngeal pouches and limb buds. In the limb, expression becomes progressively restricted to interdigital regions during differentiation. Caspase3 whole mount immunostaining revealed that cholesterol biosynthesis colocalizes with apoptotic regions that are targets of the morphogenic signal Sonic hedgehog. This expression pattern correlates closely with the shared phenotypic features of cholesterol biosynthesis and hedgehog mutants. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

INTEROGATION OF THE MANUFACTURING ROUTE OF ALUMINIUM AA 1050 USED IN LITHOGRAPHIC APPLICATION
The aluminium AA1050 alloy, known as commercially pure aluminium, contains 99.5% Al, together with Fe and Si as major alloying elements. During fabrication of aluminium substrates for lithographic printing plates in Bridgnorth Aluminium Ltd, the AA 1050 aluminium alloy proceeds through various stages of thermomechanical processing, with the conditions at each processing stage influencing the microstructure of the final coil.  Because of its specific gravity, tensile strength, surface performance and coating adhesion behaviour, the AA 1050 aluminium alloy is one of the preferred materials for offset printing, which has been the dominant printing process for years.  During manufacturing of the offset plate, the AA 1050 alloy is subjected to alkaline etching, electrograining and anodizing. Reactivity of the material to those chemical and electrochemical processes depends on various alloy properties, the thickness and composition of oxide film over the macroscopic alloy surface, cold work applied and the presence of second phase particles, which influence properties and quality of the final product.During the project, the main objectives were to understand the process in the production of the final product from slab to coil as well as to investigate some microstructural changes during the following stages of the production process and, finally, the performance behaviour of the final product.The set of experiments, including microstructural observation and electrochemical tests, has been developed to investigate the AA 1050 aluminium sheet in accordance with the objective of this study. Four homogenisation trials in the industry environment were performed to enable sample collection from the real production line; also, samples from each processing stage were examined with the special attention paid to those collected during the plant experimental homogenisation trials. It was found that the microstructure of the aluminium changed throughout the different production stages and influences the material response in the alkaline solution used for etching. Furthermore, the conditions of homogenisation (time and temperature) have impact on the properties like the electrochemical behaviour in alkaline and acid solutions, as well as the microstructure of the final aluminium sheet. Differentiation between the behaviour of final gauge samples was possible in terms of characterisation of the second phase particles characterisation (distribution and composition) present in the resultant alloy product.

The value of T_C is estimated. Furthermore, the dependence of T_C on the interaction constants is explored. We outline how one can proceed in investigating this relation in the future.

Diagenetic and detrital origin of moretane anomalies through the Permian–Triassic boundary
Many biogeochemical anomalies coincide with the Late 1 Permian Extinction
(LPE; 252.28 Ma). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the
moretane/hopane anomaly that has been identified in samples from Meishan GSSP
section in southeastern China. Here, we report homohopane, 2α- and 3β-
methylhomohopane and lithological data for a drill core from the Meishan section in
southeastern China. Three intervals of elevated C30 moretane/hopane ratios are recorded
in the Lungtan, Yinkeng and Helongshan Formations. Moretane/hopane ratios of C31-34
homohopanes and the 2α- and 3β-methylhomohopanes display the same stratigraphic
patterns as the C30 moretane/hopane record. In light of the multiple and parallel moretane
anomalies for the homohopane and 2α- and 3β-methylhomohopane series, enhanced input
from higher plant organic matter, such as coal and peat, does not adequately explain the
observed isomer patterns. Correlation of high moretane/hopane ratios with low C35 HHI
and high hopane/sterane values suggest increased input of hopanoids from oxic soils.
Additionally, moretane/hopane ratios show excellent correlations with total clay
percentages and specific clay types, particularly chlorite, illite, and mixed layer
illite/smectite. We conclude that a combination of episodic hopanoid input from soil
bacteria and diagenetic effects related to redox and detrital clays generated the unique
moretane/hopane patterns at Meishan. Similar relationships of Ts/(Ts+Tm) with redox and source indicators and
lithology indicate that Ts/(Ts+Tm) is affected by the same factors controlling the moretane/hopane ratios. Berthierine, a clay that requires reducing conditions for
formation, was detected in samples from the Lungtan Formation. We are unable to
determine from our results whether the berthierine is authigenic or detrital, but future
determination of the origin of berthierine at Meishan may offer additional environmental
insight. No link between diasteranes and lithology was observed in this study suggesting
that diasteranes are relatively unaffected by the detrital clay component of the Meishan
sediments. In total, the results point toward the complex role of source input, lithology,
and depositional redox conditions in the transformation of organic matter during
maturation. Future work is required to elucidate the lithological effects on diagenetic
processes, including biomarker genesis isomerization, and thermal degradation.Author Posting. © The Author(s), 2011.  This is the author's version of the work.

Soil organic matter transport along an sub-Arctic river–sea transect
Bacteriohopanepolyols (BHPs) and glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) have potential as soil-tracing biomarkers for the extensive shelves of the Arctic Ocean. In this work these biomarkers were analysed in surface sediments along a well characterised sub-Arctic transect in the northernmost Baltic Sea from the Kalix River to the central Bothnian Bay to assess their environmental behaviour and potential for tracing the contribution of soil in this type of system. There was a high BHP diversity and enhanced total BHP concentration in the estuarine sediments, whereas a much less diverse pattern could be observed in the open bay with lower total BHP concentration. In addition, both soil marker BHPs (adenosylhopanes) and branched GDGTs were substantially more abundant in the estuarine than the open bay sediments. The R soil ′ index, based on the Rsoil index minus the contribution from the methylated soil marker BHPs, is suggested as a new approach for tracing soil derived organic matter (OM) in the (sub)-Arctic region. The index decreased along the transect in an off-river direction, correlating strongly with both the branched and isoprenoid tetraether (BIT) index and the stable carbon isotopic composition of the sedimentary organic carbon.

A Comparative Study of Helicopter Engine Air Particle Separation Technologies
An investigation into the efficacy of helicopter engine sand filters is conducted. Engine Air Particle Separation devices are broadly split into three categories: Vortex Tube Separators, Integrated Particle Separators, and Inlet Barrier Filters. The first two are inertial separators that scavenge particles by centrifugal force; the latter traps particles on its surface, but all three are designed with the aim or removing all particles from the engine bound air. Each technology is different, which gives rise to varying levels of efficacy. The current work uses low order analytical and numerical models to explore these differences and introduces a metric for quantifying the quality of air-particle separation performance. The vortex tube separators exhibit a high efficiency and low pressure drop, but require auxiliary power to operate and experience considerable drag at high forward speeds. Inertial particle separators do not achieve the high separation efficiencies of the vortex tubes or barrier filters, but have a large mass flow to frontal area ratio, hence low drag. Inlet barrier filters are highly efficient at removing particles and improve in this over time due to the accumulation of particles, but at the expense of a temporally increasing pressure drop. The new metric is a quality factor that can be used to directly compare separation technologies for helicopter. Its application is demonstrated by the inlet barrier filter which, when clean, is the best performing device, but over time deteriorates in quality due to the accumulation of particles.

[prion, yeast, inheritance]

Heritable yeast prions have a highly organized three-dimensional architecture with interfiber structures
Yeast prions constitute a “protein-only” mechanism of inheritance that is widely deployed by wild yeast to create diverse phenotypes. One of the best-characterized prions, PSI+, is governed by a conformational change in the prion domain of Sup35, a translation-termination factor. When this domain switches from its normal soluble form to an insoluble amyloid, the ensuing change in protein synthesis creates new traits. Two factors make these traits heritable: (i) the amyloid conformation is self-templating; and (ii) the protein-remodeling factor heat-shock protein (Hsp)104 (acting together with Hsp70 chaperones) partitions the template to daughter cells with high fidelity. Prions formed by several other yeast proteins create their own phenotypes but share the same mechanistic basis of inheritance. Except for the amyloid fibril itself, the cellular architecture underlying these protein-based elements of inheritance is unknown. To study the 3D arrangement of prion assemblies in their cellular context, we examined yeast PSI+ prions in the native, hydrated state in situ, taking advantage of recently developed methods for cryosectioning of vitrified cells. Cryo–electron tomography of the vitrified sections revealed the prion assemblies as aligned bundles of regularly spaced fibrils in the cytoplasm with no bounding structures. Although the fibers were widely spaced, other cellular complexes, such as ribosomes, were excluded from the fibril arrays. Subtomogram image averaging, made possible by the organized nature of the assemblies, uncovered the presence of an additional array of densities between the fibers. We suggest these structures constitute a self-organizing mechanism that coordinates fiber deposition and the regulation of prion inheritance.

The Effect of Private Information and Monitoring on the Role of Accounting Quality in Investment Decisions
Information asymmetry between managers and outside capital suppliers can affect how firms finance capital investments. A growing body of evidence indicates that better accounting quality can reduce information asymmetry costs and reduce financing constraints. Consistent with this possibility, Biddle and Hilary (2006) document that higher accounting quality reduces the sensitivity of firms’ investment to their internally generated cash flows. Verdi (2006) and Biddle, Hillary, and Verdi (2009) find that accounting quality is positively correlated with investment for firms prone to underinvest and is negatively correlated with investment for firms prone to overinvest.

Microarray gene expression analysis of fixed archival tissue permits molecular classification and identification of potential therapeutic targets in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
Refractory/relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has a poor prognosis. Novel drugs targeting the constitutively activated NF-κB pathway characteristic of ABC-DLBCL are promising, but evaluation depends on accurate activated B cell-like (ABC)/germinal center B cell-like (GCB) molecular classification. This is traditionally performed on gene microarray expression profiles of fresh biopsies, which are not routinely collected, or by immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, which lacks reproducibility and classification accuracy. We explored the possibility of using routine archival FFPE tissue for gene microarray applications. We examined Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 gene expression profiles from paired archival FFPE and fresh-frozen tissues of 40 ABC/GCB-classified DLBCL cases to compare classification accuracy and test the potential for this approach to aid the discovery of therapeutic targets and disease classifiers in DLBCL. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of unselected present probe sets distinguished ABC/GCB in FFPE with remarkable accuracy, and a Bayesian classifier correctly assigned 32 of 36 cases with >90% probability. Enrichment for NF-κB genes was appropriately seen in ABC-DLBCL FFPE tissues. The top discriminatory genes expressed in FFPE separated cases with high statistical significance and contained novel biology with potential therapeutic insights, warranting further investigation. These results support a growing understanding that archival FFPE tissues can be used in microarray experiments aimed at molecular classification, prognostic biomarker discovery, and molecular exploration of rare diseases.

Considerations in Developing and Delivering a Nonpharmacological Intervention for Symptom Management in Lung Cancer: The Views of Patients and Informal Caregivers.
CONTEXT: Few studies consider patient's and caregiver's preferences when developing nonpharmacological interventions. This is important to develop acceptable and accessible nonpharmacological interventions for patients with cancer. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to identify the views of patients with lung cancer and their informal caregivers on the desirable components of a novel nonpharmacological intervention for the management of the symptom cluster of cough, breathlessness, and fatigue, and their needs and preferences regarding uptake and delivery of the intervention. METHODS: This study was qualitative in orientation, using semistructured interviews and framework analysis to elicit the views of 37 patients with lung cancer and 23 caregivers regarding the issues that were perceived to be important regarding the development and delivery of a nonpharmacological intervention. RESULTS: A number of key issues were identified that carried important implications for patient's participation and adherence to the intervention, including the perceived relevance of potential techniques; appreciable benefits in the short term; convenience; variation in patient's preferences; timing of the intervention; venue; caregiver's involvement; the provider of the intervention, and contact with other patients. CONCLUSION: The data from this study have provided insight into the key issues that are likely to influence the development, uptake, and delivery of a nonpharmacological intervention to help manage the respiratory symptom cluster of cough, breathlessness, and fatigue. It is crucial that these findings are considered when developing and modeling a nonpharmacological symptom management intervention.

Accurately assessing the risk of schizophrenia conferred by rare copy-number variation affecting genes with brain function.
Investigators have linked rare copy number variation (CNVs) to neuropsychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia. One hypothesis is that CNV events cause disease by affecting genes with specific brain functions. Under these circumstances, we expect that CNV events in cases should impact brain-function genes more frequently than those events in controls. Previous publications have applied "pathway" analyses to genes within neuropsychiatric case CNVs to show enrichment for brain-functions. While such analyses have been suggestive, they often have not rigorously compared the rates of CNVs impacting genes with brain function in cases to controls, and therefore do not address important confounders such as the large size of brain genes and overall differences in rates and sizes of CNVs. To demonstrate the potential impact of confounders, we genotyped rare CNV events in 2,415 unaffected controls with Affymetrix 6.0; we then applied standard pathway analyses using four sets of brain-function genes and observed an apparently highly significant enrichment for each set. The enrichment is simply driven by the large size of brain-function genes. Instead, we propose a case-control statistical test, cnv-enrichment-test, to compare the rate of CNVs impacting specific gene sets in cases versus controls. With simulations, we demonstrate that cnv-enrichment-test is robust to case-control differences in CNV size, CNV rate, and systematic differences in gene size. Finally, we apply cnv-enrichment-test to rare CNV events published by the International Schizophrenia Consortium (ISC). This approach reveals nominal evidence of case-association in neuronal-activity and the learning gene sets, but not the other two examined gene sets. The neuronal-activity genes have been associated in a separate set of schizophrenia cases and controls; however, testing in independent samples is necessary to definitively confirm this association. Our method is implemented in the PLINK software package.

Three-dimensional Integrated Circuit Design
With vastly increased complexity and functionality in the "nanometer era" (i.e. hundreds of millions of transistors on one chip), increasing the performance of integrated circuits has become a challenging task. This is due primarily to the inevitable increase in the distance among circuit elements and interconnect design solutions have become the greatest determining factor in overall performance.Three-dimensional (3D) integrated circuits (ICs), which contain multiple layers of active devices, have the potential to enhance dramatically chip performance and functionality, while reducing the distance among devices on a chip. They promise solutions to the current "interconnect bottleneck" challenges faced by IC designers. They also may facilitate the integration of heterogeneous materials, devices, and signals. However, before these advantages can be realized, key technology challenges of 3D ICs must be addressed.This is the first book on 3-D integrated circuit design, covering all of the technological and design aspects of this emerging design paradigm, while proposing effective solutions to specific challenging problems concerning the design of three-dimensional integrated circuits. A handy, comprehensive reference or a practical design guide, this book provides a sound foundation for the design of three-dimensional integrated circuits.

MODELLING THE PERFORMANCE OF HORIZONTAL HEAT EXCHANGER OF GROUND-COUPLED HEAT PUMP SYSTEMS WITH EGYPTIAN CONDITIONS
Mohamed Reda Othman Ali – DOCTORATE OF PHILOSOPHYThe University of Manchester – March 2013.Modelling the performance of horizontal heat exchanger of ground-coupled heat pump system with Egyptian conditionsThe aim of this work was to investigate the effect on horizontal ground heat exchanger performance of changing soil and load parameters, and pipe horizontal separation distance for ground-coupled heat pumps under Egyptian conditions.Egypt possesses a variety of energy resources; namely fossil and renewable. The amount of renewable energy available is significant and must be utilized perfectly for the sake of achieving sustainable use of energy resources. Soils in Egypt vary widely from being clay with its thermal conductivity of 1.11 (for clay particles) to sand with its thermal conductivity of 5.77 (for sand particles). Two soil samples were chosen from the literature to be used in the investigation held in this work with boundary conditions that match the weather and ground temperature distribution conditions in Egypt.Conduction heat transfer in soils is a very complicated process especially when it is combined with time dependant boundary conditions and temperature dependent thermophysical properties of the medium. A MATLAB code was used to estimate thermophysical properties of the soil samples with three different moisture contents (0, 0.2, and saturation %) and the upper boundary condition bases on two surface dryness conditions (dry and wet). The results of the code were fed to Abqaus/CAE to analysis and predict the temperature distribution in these soils with implementing the time dependant boundary conditions to investigate the ground thermal behaviour of these soils. Also the temperature distribution around two pipes per trench of horizontal ground heat exchanger with applying synthetic load based on estimated cooling and heating degree days for one set of weather conditions. The horizontal separation distance between pipes was investigated by changing it to be 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 metres.Both the MATLAB code and Abaqus environment were validated against measured data published in the literature and their results agreed well with this data.The results of the simulation showed that the ground thermal behaviour depends mainly on the boundary conditions applied on the model. Dry soils are the worst being affected by the variation of the boundaries, because of its low volumetric heat capacities. The moisture content in the soil should be kept around 0.2 or above to get the most benefits from the presence of moisture in the vicinity of ground heat exchangers. The effect of the soil surface dryness is less significant than that of the moisture content of the entire system but it is more controllable than the moisture content. Also it was found that the horizontal separation distance (HSD) between pipes must be selected on the bases of prior knowledge of the site parameters soil type and moisture level. The results showed that the 0.4m HSD is the optimum HSD for the conditions and load profile included in this study.

Effect of pretreatment with risperidone on phencyclidine-induced disruptions in object recognition memory and prefrontal cortex parvalbumin immunoreactivity in the rat.
Sub-chronic administration of phencyclidine to the rat induces enduring cognitive and pathophysiological changes that resemble some features of schizophrenia. The present study aimed to determine if concurrent administration of the atypical antipsychotic, risperidone, could attenuate the effect of phencyclidine on object recognition memory and parvalbumin-containing neurons in the prefrontal cortex. Rats were administered phencyclidine at a dose of 2mg/kg i.p. bi-daily for 1 week, or vehicle. Half of the phencyclidine group was concurrently treated with risperidone (0.5mg/kg i.p.) twice daily for 10 days, beginning 3 days before the start of phencyclidine administration. Novel object recognition memory and subsequent brain analysis were assessed 6 weeks post-phencyclidine treatment. Phencyclidine produced a deficit in object recognition memory as measured by the discrimination ratio. In addition, 6 weeks post-phencyclidine, analysis of brains showed a reduction in expression of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons in the prefrontal cortex, with specific deficits observed in the prelimbic region, but not infralimbic or cingulate cortices. Concurrent administration of risperidone showed no protective effects against these deficits. These results show the importance of the sub-chronic phencyclidine rat in modelling cognitive and prefrontal pathophysiology observed in schizophrenia, but suggest that concurrent risperidone is not neuroprotective in this model.

[kd, assay, keloid]

Long-term organ culture of keloid disease tissue.
Keloid disease (KD) is a common fibroproliferative disorder of unknown aetiopathogenesis, with highly unsatisfactory treatment. Therefore, it is crucial to have a robust and clinically relevant model for studying KD pathobiology as well as preclinical testing of potential KD therapeutics. However, the unique occurrence of KD in human skin and the corresponding lack of animal models pose a major challenge in KD research. Therefore, we developed a simplified assay for the serum-free, long-term organ culture of KD tissue that facilitates quantitative analyses of major KD read-out parameters. Four millimetre KD punches embedded in a collagen matrix and organ-cultured at the epidermis air-liquid interphase (ALI) in supplemented William's E medium showed optimal tissue, cell and RNA preservation for up to 6 weeks (as measured by H & E and Pyronin Y histochemistry as well as by MTT assay, lactate dehydrogenase release and quantitative Ki67/TUNEL immunohistomorphometry). The keloid phenotype persisted well during this period, as shown by collagen-I and -III synthesis (Herovici's histochemistry staining and ELISA), and analysis of the expression of significant KD markers (CD3, CD20, CD31, CD34, CD56, tryptase, Langerin, vimentin, neutrophil elastase, CTGF and Collagen). To functionally evaluate whether this assay can test the response to candidate therapeutics, dexamethasone, a glucocorticosteroid often used in KD therapy, was administered. Indeed, dexamethasone significantly reduced the keloid volume and cellularity plus induced epidermal shrinkage. Therefore, this novel assay provides a quantitative, clinically relevant model system for studying KD pathobiology and response to treatment.

SYSTEMS BIOLOGY: TOWARDS REALISTIC AND USEFUL MODELS OF MOLECULAR NETWORKS
Molecular biology is shifting focus from single molecules to networks of molecules. This development has changed our way of doing research and is challenging our thinking about cells. Cells turn out be complicated molecular systems displaying multivariate dynamics that can rarely be understood in terms of single molecules. One way to appreciate this complexity is to make mathematical models of signaling, gene, and metabolic network to assess the systemic consequences of specific molecular perturbations. This chapter gives a brief overview of some of the approach in mathematical modeling of molecular networks. We choose to keep the mathematical detail minimal and highlight a number of concepts and approaches that are emerging in the analysis of molecular networks.

Yeast 5 - an expanded reconstruction of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolic network.
UNLABELLED: ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Efforts to improve the computational reconstruction of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae biochemical reaction network and to refine the stoichiometrically constrained metabolic models that can be derived from such a reconstruction have continued since the first stoichiometrically constrained yeast genome scale metabolic model was published in 2003. Continuing this ongoing process, we have constructed an update to the Yeast Consensus Reconstruction, Yeast 5. The Yeast Consensus Reconstruction is a product of efforts to forge a community-based reconstruction emphasizing standards compliance and biochemical accuracy via evidence-based selection of reactions. It draws upon models published by a variety of independent research groups as well as information obtained from biochemical databases and primary literature. RESULTS: Yeast 5 refines the biochemical reactions included in the reconstruction, particularly reactions involved in sphingolipid metabolism; updates gene-reaction annotations; and emphasizes the distinction between reconstruction and stoichiometrically constrained model. Although it was not a primary goal, this update also improves the accuracy of model prediction of viability and auxotrophy phenotypes and increases the number of epistatic interactions. This update maintains an emphasis on standards compliance, unambiguous metabolite naming, and computer-readable annotations available through a structured document format. Additionally, we have developed MATLAB scripts to evaluate the model's predictive accuracy and to demonstrate basic model applications such as simulating aerobic and anaerobic growth. These scripts, which provide an independent tool for evaluating the performance of various stoichiometrically constrained yeast metabolic models using flux balance analysis, are included as Additional files 1, 2 and 3. CONCLUSIONS: Yeast 5 expands and refines the computational reconstruction of yeast metabolism and improves the predictive accuracy of a stoichiometrically constrained yeast metabolic model. It differs from previous reconstructions and models by emphasizing the distinction between the yeast metabolic reconstruction and the stoichiometrically constrained model, and makes both available as Additional file 4 and Additional file 5 and at http://yeast.sf.net/ as separate systems biology markup language (SBML) files. Through this separation, we intend to make the modeling process more accessible, explicit, transparent, and reproducible.

An IL-7 fusion protein that shows increased thymopoietic ability.
The role of IL-7 during thymopoiesis has led to it being the focus of a number of therapeutic interventions. However, its small size and pleiotropic nature present problems for thymus-directed therapies. We have created a fusion molecule between the extracellular N-terminal domain of CCR9 and IL-7, which has the potential to overcome these difficulties. This novel fusion protein retains the thymopoietic activity of IL-7 and the ligand-binding ability of CCR9. As a thymopoietic agent, compared with IL-7, it shows an enhanced retention in the thymus, increased de novo T cell production, and increased thymic output. Old mice receiving the fusion protein show improved CD8 T cell responses and reduced viral load after infection with influenza virus compared with those receiving IL-7. This chimeric molecule offers a novel therapeutic strategy that may result in the production of an effective immunorestorative agent.

Differential distribution of haematopoietic and nonhaematopoietic progenitor cells in intralesional and extralesional keloid: do keloid scars provide a niche for nonhaematopoietic mesenchymal stem cells?
BACKGROUND: Keloid disease is a benign, quasineoplastic disease with a high recurrence rate. Mesenchymal-like stem cells (MLSC) have previously been demonstrated in keloid scars and may be involved in keloid pathobiology. However, as these cells have only been examined by single colour fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) alone, they need to be more comprehensively characterized so that the key cellular contributors to keloid scars can be better understood. OBJECTIVES: To identify and characterize MLSC in intralesional and extralesional keloid, and to distinguish haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). METHODS AND PATIENTS: Punch biopsies from intralesional (top, middle and margin) and extralesional keloid scar sites were obtained from 17 patients with a keloid. Multicolour FACS analysis using antibodies specific for HSC markers CD34 and CD117 and MSC markers CD13, CD29, CD44 and CD90 was performed on freshly isolated keloid scar cells and on passage 0 and 1 cells. This was complemented by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistological in situ analyses. RESULTS: Keloid scars contain distinct subpopulations of MLSCs. Cells positive for CD13, CD29, CD44 and CD90 were found to be significantly (P<0·05) higher in the top and middle compartments of keloid scars compared with extralesional skin, where cells positive for CD34, CD90 and CD117 (representing HSCs) predominated. A unique population of CD34+ cells (cells positive for CD13, CD29, CD34, CD44 and CD90) were found in keloid scars and in extralesional skin. FACS and quantitative PCR analysis showed that many of the MSC markers were progressively downregulated and all HSC markers were lost during extended keloid fibroblast culture up to passage 1. CONCLUSION: We have found distinct subpopulations of haematopoietic and nonhaematopoietic MSC in keloid scars, whereby HSC accumulate extralesionally, while keloids seem to provide a niche environment for nonhaematopoietic MSC. Future therapy of keloids may have to target differentially both stem cell populations in order to deprive these tumours of their regenerative cell pools.

Accelerated cellular senescence in degenerate intervertebral discs: a possible role in the pathogenesis of intervertebral disc degeneration.
Current evidence implicates intervertebral disc degeneration as a major cause of low back pain, although its pathogenesis is poorly understood. Numerous characteristic features of disc degeneration mimic those seen during ageing but appear to occur at an accelerated rate. We hypothesised that this is due to accelerated cellular senescence, which causes fundamental changes in the ability of disc cells to maintain the intervertebral disc (IVD) matrix, thus leading to IVD degeneration. Cells isolated from non-degenerate and degenerate human tissue were assessed for mean telomere length, senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal), and replicative potential. Expression of P16INK4A (increased in cellular senescence) was also investigated in IVD tissue by means of immunohistochemistry. RNA from tissue and cultured cells was used for real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis for matrix metalloproteinase-13, ADAMTS 5 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs 5), and P16INK4A. Mean telomere length decreased with age in cells from non-degenerate tissue and also decreased with progressive stages of degeneration. In non-degenerate discs, there was an age-related increase in cellular expression of P16INK4A. Cells from degenerate discs (even from young patients) exhibited increased expression of P16INK4A, increased SA-beta-gal staining, and a decrease in replicative potential. Importantly, there was a positive correlation between P16INK4A and matrix-degrading enzyme gene expression. Our findings indicate that disc cell senescence occurs in vivo and is accelerated in IVD degeneration. Furthermore, the senescent phenotype is associated with increased catabolism, implicating cellular senescence in the pathogenesis of IVD degeneration.

Cytochrome P1B1 (CYP1B1) polymorphisms and ovarian cancer risk: a meta-analysis.
CYP1B1 is a key P450 enzyme involved in the metabolism of exogenous and endogenous substrates and plays a key role in hormone-induced carcinogenesis. Risk factors for ovarian cancer are related to hormonal exposure and reproduction, and polymorphisms within genes involved in metabolism of oestrogen and certain xenobiotics may influence the risk of developing ovarian cancer. Current meta-analysis evaluated four CYP1B1 polymorphisms (Leu432Val, Arg48Gly, Ala119Ser and Asn453Ser) for their association with ovarian cancer risk. A search of the MEDLINE bibliographic database for the period up to April 2012 identified five relevant studies. With regards to Leu432Val polymorphism, all of the five studies were eligible (1199 cases and 2596 controls) for analysis, while for Arg48Gly (799 cases and 1169 controls), Ala119Ser (799 cases and 1172 controls) and Asn453Ser (361cases and 1577 controls) only two studies were eligible for analysis. Fixed-effect models were used to estimate pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and chi-square based Q-test was used to test for heterogeneity. The pooled OR (95% CI) for CYP1B1_Leu432Val polymorphism were 1.1 (0.84-1.31) for heterozygous subjects and 0.82 (0.57-1.17) for homozygous Val subjects. In a recessive model, homozygous carriers of Leu432Val showed a weak trend towards reduced risk as compared to 'wild type' and heterozygous carriers (OR 0.8, 95% CI; 0.66-0.99); however, this association was of limited significance. Regarding Arg48Gly, the pooled OR (95% CI) were 1.06 (0.89-1.27) for heterozygous and 0.98 (1.72-1.33) for homozygous Gly subjects. With respect to Ala119Ser and Asn453Ser, the pooled OR were 1.06 (0.87-1.29) and 1.24 (0.94-1.63) for heterozygous and 1.1 (0.8-1.52) and 1.09 (0.5-2.34) for homozygous respectively. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that CYP1B1 polymorphisms are not associated with ovarian cancer risk. Studies evaluating CYP1B1_Leu432Val polymorphism are required to further elucidate the risk of ovarian cancer with this polymorphism. Additionally, studies amongst Asian and African subjects are required to estimate race-specific effects.

[infection, pulmonary, immune]

Colonic bacterial infection abrogates eosinophilic pulmonary disease.
Induction of immunity to one pathogen in the lungs modifies the microenvironment and alters immunopathological changes that result from a second, unrelated pulmonary infection. However, it is unclear whether immunity generated at distant sites also affects lung immune responses. Here, we show that infection with the gut-restricted bacterium Citrobacter rodentium modifies immunopathological changes that result from pulmonary Cryptococcus neoformans infection. Th2 cytokine-driven pulmonary eosinophilia induced by C. neoformans infection was reduced, and the enhanced Th1 cytokine environment afforded more-rapid clearance of the fungus in C. rodentium-immune mice. The activated and intraepithelial (CD103+) T cell populations that expand after C. neoformans infection were diminished in C. rodentium-immune mice. T cell cross-reactivity was absent, but cross-reactive antibodies were detected. It is of importance to the "hygiene hypothesis" that these data indicate that an immune response induced by a gut-restricted pathogen can modify the immune outcome after pulmonary infection, suggesting that cell-phenotype modifications occur across mucosal sites.

The preclinical profile of asenapine: clinical relevance for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar mania.
Introduction: Asenapine is a novel antipsychotic drug approved for the treatment of acute schizophrenia, manic, or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, as a maintenance treatment of schizophrenia and as an adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adults. Areas covered: This review focuses on the preclinical profile of asenapine. It analyzes the pharmacological, neurochemical, behavioral, and molecular mechanisms of asenapine and their contribution to the beneficial therapeutic advantages of the drug as reported in published preclinical and clinical studies, product labels, and poster presentations. Expert opinion: Asenapine exhibits a broad pharmacological profile that targets a wide range of neurotransmitter receptors with variable affinities. The drug preferentially increases dopamine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine levels in cortical and limbic brain areas. It also potentiates cortical glutamatergic neurotransmission, and is active in behavioral animal models predictive of antipsychotic, antidepressant, and pro-cognitive activities. Chronic administration of asenapine alters the abundance of dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, adrenergic, and cholinergic receptor subtypes in different brain regions. These action mechanisms of asenapine might contribute to its unique psychopharmacological properties in the improved treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.

Is the lack of surgery amongst older postmenopausal women with breast cancer explained by comorbidity
ObjectivesAudit data consistently report around 60% of UK women aged ≥80 years old do not have surgery fortheir breast cancer (compared with < 10% of younger women). However, previous studies have notadjusted for patient co-morbidity. We have therefore investigated the extent to which age-associateddifferences in breast cancer surgery rates, amongst women aged ≥65 years, can be accounted for byco-morbidity.MethodsWomen with invasive breast cancer diagnosed between 1997- 2005 in the Northern & Yorkshire andWest Midlands regions were identified from cancer registration, along with whether surgery wasreceived. Linkage to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) was used to estimate co-morbidity in thepreceding year. The Charlson co-morbidity score (range 0 no co-morbidity to 6 greatest comorbidity)was derived from clinical coding within HES. In addition to co-morbidity, the impact oftumour stage, deprivation, year and region on treatment received were also examined.ResultsRecords were available for 23,038 women aged ≥65 years. The proportion receiving surgery fell in thepresence of increasing co-morbidity (Charlson score 0= 74%, score 1= 66%, score 2= 52%, score3+=43%) However, after adjustment for co-morbidity and other covariates, older age continued topredict lack of surgery. Compared to 65-69 year olds, the odds of surgery decreased with age from0.74 (95% CI: 0.66-0.83) for 70-74 year olds to 0.13 (95% CI: 0.11-0.14) for women aged ≥85 years.The proportion of women receiving surgery was significantly lower in more deprived areas, butincreased with each successive diagnosis year group.ConclusionsWhilst co-morbidity, as measured in administrative data, is associated with a reduced likelihood ofsurgery, it does not explain the apparent shortfall in surgery amongst older women in the UK. Futureresearch should consider the importance of patient preferences for treatment in addition toindividual-level measures of co-morbidity and frailty.

MALDI-ToF MS Analysis of Glycosyltransferase Activities on Gold Surface Arrays
Glycan-processing enzymes such as glycosyltransferases and glycosidases are responsible for the makeup of the glycome. The definition of their substrate specificities is, therefore, a central task in glycomics. In addition, these enzymes are themselves useful synthetic tools for the generation of complex carbohydrate structures as an alternative to tedious chemical synthesis. There has been great interest in using microarrays for studying these glycoenzymes because it allows the specificity of the enzyme to be probed against a panel of immobilized potential substrates, and also expands the repertoire of sugar arrays available for further carbohydrate–protein interaction studies. In particular, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiols on gold surfaces have proven to be a valuable platform for such studies due to their robustness and their biocompatible, well-defined structure. Furthermore, a direct observation of the change in mass of immobilized substrates due to enzymatic processing is possible through label-free MALDI-ToF MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry) technique. In this chapter, we describe the preparation of SAMs-coated gold surface arrays presenting carbohydrate or (glyco)peptide substrates, either pre-formed or directly synthesized on-chip, and MALDI-ToF MS analysis of glycosyltransferase activities on these immobilized substrates.

Protein kinase C regulates late cell cycle-dependent gene expression.
The control of the cell cycle in eukaryotes is exerted in part by the coordinated action of a series of transcription factor complexes. This is exemplified by the Mcm1p-Fkh2p-Ndd1p complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which controls the cyclical expression of the CLB2 cluster of genes at the G(2)/M phase transition. The activity of this complex is positively controlled by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) and polo kinases. Here, we demonstrate that the protein kinase Pkc1p works in the opposite manner to inhibit the activity of the Mcm1p-Fkh2p-Ndd1p complex and the expression of its target genes. In particular, Pkc1p causes phosphorylation of the coactivator protein Ndd1p. Reductions in Pkc1p activity and the presence of Pkc1p-insensitive Ndd1p mutant proteins lead to changes in the timing of CLB2 cluster expression and result in associated late cell cycle defects. This study therefore identifies an important role for Pkc1p in controlling the correct temporal expression of genes in the cell cycle.

Recombination via point defects and their complexes in solar silicon
Electronic grade Czochralski and float zone silicon in the as grown state have a very low concentration of recombination generation centers (typically <1010âcmâ3). Consequently, in integrated circuit technologies using such material, electrically active inadvertent impurities and structural defects are rarely detectable. The quest for cheap photovoltaic cells has led to the use of less pure silicon, multi-crystalline material, and low cost processing for solar applications. Cells made in this way have significant extrinsic recombination mechanisms. In this paper we review recombination involving defects and impurities in single crystal and in multi-crystalline solar silicon. Our main techniques for this work are recombination lifetime mapping measurements using microwave detected photoconductivity decay and variants of deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS). In particular, we use Laplace DLTS to distinguish between isolated point defects, small precipitate complexes and decorated extended defects. We compare the behavior of some common metallic contaminants in solar silicon in relation to their effect on carrier lifetime and cell efficiency. Finally, we consider the role of hydrogen passivation in relation to transition metal contaminants, grain boundaries and dislocations. We conclude that recombination via point defects can be significant but in most multi-crystalline material the dominant recombination path is via decorated dislocation clusters within grains with little contribution to the overall recombination from grain boundaries.

Structural and Optoelectronic Properties of Rare Earth Doped Silicon Photonic Materials
The thesis presented here entitled “Structural and Optoelectronic Properties of Rare Earth Doped Silicon Photonic Materials” for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy is submitted to the University of Manchester by Hang Li in December 2012.The original work presented in this thesis concentrates on the origin of the luminescence and the possible radiative loss mechanisms in rare earth (RE) and silicon nanocrystals (Si-NCs) co-doped SiO2. The optoelectronic properties of these materials were studied by employing laser or Xe lamp correlated photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL spectroscopy and the structural and compositional characterisation was carried out using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning TEM (STEM).The pressure dependence of the band-gap of Si-NCs is strongly correlated to the co-doped erbium (Er) concentration. A conventional diamond anvil cell (DAC) was used for applying the hydrostatic pressure. A strong quenching and a non-linear red-shift of the PL of Si-NCs were obtained with increasing pressure, which was attributed to the quantum confinement effect. The rate of the red-shift as a function of pressure (pressure coefficient) increases with increasing Er concentration. We propose that this is the result of a reduction in the surface tension of Si-NCs when Er ions gather at their surface.Er is present as the trivalent oxide (Er2O3) in silicon rich silicon oxide (SRSO). Large Er2O3 clusters are formed when silicon excess is low as silicon is considered as a competitor for oxygen. Under the indirect excitation, the PL of Er3+ at 1.54 μm is highly dependent on the sensitization by Si-NCs. The decay lifetime of this emission contains a slow component of about 10 ms and a fast component of the order of μs. We found that the fast component became considerably faster with increasing Er2O3 cluster size. This is an indication of strong Er3+ ion-ion interactions in large clusters, which give rise to the non-radiative recombination of excitons.A novel fabrication of RE doped SiO2 was developed by implanting RE ions into silicon wafer directly and followed by the thermal oxidation and rapid thermal annealing (RTA) in contrast to the conventional procedure, in which the ion implantation was carried out after the oxidation of silicon wafer. TEM images showed that RE ions were distributed close to the surface of SiO2 film via the novel method but via the conventional method they were located at certain depth below the surface. Ce3+ doped SiO2 prepared via both methods has a broad blue PL ranging from around 380 to 470 nm attributed to the 5d-4f transitions and Eu3+ has a red PL with several narrow bands in the range of 570 to 700 nm attributed to the intra-4f transitions. Concentration quenching is one of the limiting factors for the conventional fabrication whilst it is successfully minimised by the novel method. A new phase of Ce silicate (Ce2Si2O7) may grow after the high temperature RTA via the novel method and leads to a remarkable enhancement of the Ce3+ luminescence.

Ice formation and development in aged, wintertime cumulus over the UK: observations and modelling
In situ high resolution aircraft measurements of cloud microphysical properties were made in coordination with ground based remote sensing observations of a line of small cumulus clouds, using Radar and Lidar, as part of the Aerosol Properties, PRocesses And InfluenceS on the Earth's climate (APPRAISE) project. A narrow but extensive line (similar to 100 km long) of shallow convective clouds over the southern UK was studied. Cloud top temperatures were observed to be higher than -8 A degrees C, but the clouds were seen to consist of supercooled droplets and varying concentrations of ice particles. No ice particles were observed to be falling into the cloud tops from above. Current parameterisations of ice nuclei (IN) numbers predict too few particles will be active as ice nuclei to account for ice particle concentrations at the observed, near cloud top, temperatures (-7.5 A degrees C). The role of mineral dust particles, consistent with concentrations observed near the surface, acting as high temperature IN is considered important in this case. It was found that very high concentrations of ice particles (up to 100 L-1) could be produced by secondary ice particle production providing the observed small amount of primary ice (about 0.01 L-1) was present to initiate it. This emphasises the need to understand primary ice formation in slightly supercooled clouds. It is shown using simple calculations that the Hallett-Mossop process (HM) is the likely source of the secondary ice. Model simulations of the case study were performed with the Aerosol Cloud and Precipitation Interactions Model (ACPIM). These parcel model investigations confirmed the HM process to be a very important mechanism for producing the observed high ice concentrations. A key step in generating the high concentrations was the process of collision and coalescence of rain drops, which once formed fell rapidly through the cloud, collecting ice particles which caused them to freeze and form instant large riming particles. The broadening of the droplet size-distribution by collision-coalescence was, therefore, a vital step in this process as this was required to generate the large number of ice crystals observed in the time available. Simulations were also performed with the WRF (Weather, Research and Forecasting) model. The results showed that while HM does act to increase the mass and number concentration of ice particles in these model simulations it was not found to be critical for the formation of precipitation. However, the WRF simulations produced a cloud top that was too cold and this, combined with the assumption of continual replenishing of ice nuclei removed by ice crystal formation, resulted in too many ice crystals forming by primary nucleation compared to the observations and parcel modelling.

[ci, woman, cohort, postmenopausal, year, hysterectomy, mood, flush, hot, rating]

Prevalence, frequency and problem rating of hot flushes persist in older postmenopausal women: impact of age, body mass index, hysterectomy, hormone therapy use, lifestyle and mood in a cross-sectional cohort study of 10,418 British women aged 54-65.
OBJECTIVE: Hot flushes and night sweats (HFs/NSs) are the main menopausal symptoms, but few studies have been adequately powered to examine the dimensions or predictors of experiencing HFs/NSs. We report on these variables in a large UK cohort of postmenopausal women. DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study. SETTING: UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) cohort. POPULATION: A cohort of 202,638 postmenopausal women, aged 50-74 years, without oophorectomy, recruited to UKCTOCS between 2001 and 2005. METHODS: Women completed a follow-up questionnaire, and those aged 54-65 years were mailed a survey in July 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:   Hot flush prevalence and hot flush rating scale. RESULTS: Of the 15,000 women mailed, 10,418 returned completed questionnaires; 90% had previously had HFs/NSs. Despite being on average 10 years postmenopausal, 54% experienced HFs/NSs (frequency of 33 per week with mean problem rating 4/10) that persisted across the age range. Past hysterectomy (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.19-1.86), ever having smoked (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.11-1.46) and alcohol consumption (current units) (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.09) predicted ever having had HFs/NSs. Anxiety (OR 3.09, 95% CI 2.57-3.72), hysterectomy (OR 2.74, 95% CI 2.32-3.25), depressed mood (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.24-1.99), years since last menstrual period (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.94-0.96) and education (above and below 18 years) (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-0.99) predicted the current prevalence of HFs/NSs. Few predictors of frequency were identified, but problem rating was associated with depressed mood, hysterectomy, skirt size increase and frequency of HFs/NSs. Past hormone therapy users who had discontinued treatment were more likely to have HFs/NSs that were more frequent and problematic. CONCLUSIONS: To date, this is the largest UK study of the experience of HFs/NSs amongst older postmenopausal women. HFs/NSs are more prevalent in this age band than has previously been assumed. These findings and the associations of smoking, hysterectomy, anxiety, depressed mood and hormone therapy use with the experience of HFs/NSs have implications for prevention and symptom management.

Identification of markers of prostate cancer progression using candidate gene expression.
BACKGROUND: Metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) has no curative treatment options. Some forms of PCa are indolent and slow growing, while others metastasise quickly and may prove fatal within a very short time. The basis of this variable prognosis is poorly understood, despite considerable research. The aim of this study was to identify markers associated with the progression of PCa. METHODS: Artificial neuronal network analysis combined with data from literature and previous work produced a panel of putative PCa progression markers, which were used in a transcriptomic analysis of 29 radical prostatectomy samples and correlated with clinical outcome. RESULTS: Statistical analysis yielded seven putative markers of PCa progression, ANPEP, ABL1, PSCA, EFNA1, HSPB1, INMT and TRIP13. Two data transformation methods were utilised with only markers that were significant in both selected for further analysis. ANPEP and EFNA1 were significantly correlated with Gleason score. Models of progression co-utilising markers ANPEP and ABL1 or ANPEP and PSCA had the ability to correctly predict indolent or aggressive disease, based on Gleason score, in 89.7% and 86.2% of cases, respectively. Another model of TRIP13 expression in combination with preoperative PSA level and Gleason score was able to correctly predict recurrence in 85.7% of cases. CONCLUSION: This proof of principle study demonstrates a novel association of carcinogenic and tumourigenic gene expression with PCa stage and prognosis.

Clock Distribution Networks in 3-D Integrated Systems
3-D integration is an important technology that addresses fundamental limitations in on-chip interconnects. Several design issues related to 3-D circuits, such as multiplane synchronization, however, need to be addressed. A comparison of three 3-D clock distribution network topologies is presented in this paper. Good agreement is shown between the modeled and experimental results of a 3-D test circuit composed of three device planes. Successful operation of the 3-D test circuit at 1.4 GHz is demonstrated. Clock skew, clock delay, signal slew, and power dissipation measurements for the different clock topologies are also provided. The measurements suggest that each topology provides certain advantages and disadvantages in terms of different performance criteria. The proper choice, consequently, of a clock distribution network is not dictated by a single design objective but rather by the overall 3-D system design requirements including availability of resources and number of bonded planes.

Lithium impacts on the amplitude and period of the molecular circadian clockwork.
Lithium salt has been widely used in treatment of Bipolar Disorder, a mental disturbance associated with circadian rhythm disruptions. Lithium mildly but consistently lengthens circadian period of behavioural rhythms in multiple organisms. To systematically address the impacts of lithium on circadian pacemaking and the underlying mechanisms, we measured locomotor activity in mice in vivo following chronic lithium treatment, and also tracked clock protein dynamics (PER2::Luciferase) in vitro in lithium-treated tissue slices/cells. Lithium lengthens period of both the locomotor activity rhythms, as well as the molecular oscillations in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, lung tissues and fibroblast cells. In addition, we also identified significantly elevated PER2::LUC expression and oscillation amplitude in both central and peripheral pacemakers. Elevation of PER2::LUC by lithium was not associated with changes in protein stabilities of PER2, but instead with increased transcription of Per2 gene. Although lithium and GSK3 inhibition showed opposing effects on clock period, they acted in a similar fashion to up-regulate PER2 expression and oscillation amplitude. Collectively, our data have identified a novel amplitude-enhancing effect of lithium on the PER2 protein rhythms in the central and peripheral circadian clockwork, which may involve a GSK3-mediated signalling pathway. These findings may advance our understanding of the therapeutic actions of lithium in Bipolar Disorder or other psychiatric diseases that involve circadian rhythm disruptions.

Thermal transport of the single-crystal rare-earth nickel borocarbides RNi2B2C
The quaternary intermetallic rare-earth nickel borocarbides RNi2B2C are a family of compounds that show magnetic behavior, superconducting behavior, and/or both. Thermal transport measurements reveal both electron and phonon scattering mechanisms, and can provide information on the interplay of these two long-range phenomena. In general the thermal conductivity kappa is dominated by electrons, and the high temperature thermal conductivity is approximately linear in temperature and anomalous. For R=Tm, Ho, and Dy the low-temperature thermal conductivity exhibits a marked loss of scattering at the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature T-N. Magnon heat conduction is suggested for R=Tm. The kappa data for R=Ho lends evidence for gapless superconductivity in this material above T-N. Unlike the case for the non-magnetic superconductors in the family, R=Y and Lu, a phonon peak in the thermal conductivity below T-c is not observed down to T=1.4 K for the magnetic superconductors. Single-crystal quality seems to have a strong effect on kappa. The electron-phonon interaction appears to weaken as one progresses from R=Lu to R=Gd. The resistivity data shows the loss of scattering at T-N for R=Dy, Tb, and Gd; and the thermoelectric power for all three of these materials exhibits an enhancement below T-N.

Working Towards Equality: The Right of Migrant Workers to Equality with Nationals in Employment Law in Ireland
The exploitation of migrant workers exists in all sectors and stages of employmentin Ireland. The thesis determines that this is largely due to the variety of legalobstacles facing migrant workers during recruitment, employment and inaccessing justice. Other factors, such as the general vulnerability of migrantworkers arising from a language barrier, lack of knowledge of rights and socialisolation, also contribute to the levels of exploitation. While these latter factorsplay a significant role in the exploitation of migrant workers, this thesis willexamine the more tangible obstacles that exist within the legal realm as these arecapable of being removed through the reform of legal processes.Throughout the thesis, the issue of corporate mobility, the corporate quest forprofit and the needs of corporations to retain their competitiveness are all factorsthat are considered in seeking legal solutions to the obstacles faced by migrantworkers in Ireland. The thesis attempts to balance these interests against theinterests of migrant workers in seeking equality with Irish nationals throughoutthe employment process.Section I - Recruitment for EmploymentThe first Section of the thesis examines the recruitment of migrant workers inIreland and the processes by which migrant workers can arrive for work inIreland. Chapter 1 provides a general introduction to recruitment methods and2Working Towards Equalityidentifies the recruitment agency as the most popular and problematic ofrecruitment methods. Chapter 2 details the international and national history of theregulation of recruitment agencies and reveals the first legal obstacle faced bymigrant workers, namely, that recruitment agencies no longer operate throughfixed establishments that are easy to regulate and monitor. Provision must now bemade for developments in technology and the effects of globalisation on therecruitment industry. Chapter 3 examines the more specific regulations that couldbe adopted to protect migrant workers from the actions of those recruitmentagencies that maintain a role in the lives of migrant workers once in the State andin employment.Section II – Avoiding Legal DutiesSection II identifies the potential obstacles that can occur during the employmentrelationship. Chapter 4 takes as a specific example the situation that arose in IrishFerries in November 2005 and the concept of the flag of convenience as anavoidance tool used by corporations to cut costs and reduce the protection ofmigrant workers. This case study demonstrates very effectively the effect ofcorporate mobility and the corporate quest for profit on the most vulnerable ofmigrant workers. Chapter 5 challenges the theory that the elimination of suchavoidance schemes is inconsistent with the protection of competition andexamines both the reaction of the State and the future role of trade unions in theaftermath of the Irish Ferries case. Chapter 6 presents a shared response to thephenomenon of the flag of convenience specifically. It looks at the responsibleparties involved in the employment of migrant workers on shipping vessels,3Working Towards Equalityincluding the state of beneficial ownership, the flag state, the port state and themarket state. At the current stage of international law there is no agreed point ofresponsibility and this has hampered the protection of migrant workers. Theshared responsibility of all these stakeholders is considered vital in protecting theinterests of migrant workers.Section III – Access to JusticeThis Section looks at the obstacles faced by migrant workers when they seekaccess to justice for employment disputes in Ireland. Chapter 7 examines thepreliminary requirements that have to be met by migrant workers and finds thatthese requirements often exclude some of the most vulnerable migrant workersfrom seeking justice. In particular, the Chapter looks at the situation of irregular1migrant workers in Ireland and challenges the view that such workers should nothave access to any services in Ireland, including access to employment disputeresolution procedures. Chapter 8 looks at the structure of the employment disputeresolution process and argues that the current complex system is an obstacle toaccessing justice in Ireland. Finally, in Chapter 9, the lack of availability ofremedies under the current system for migrant workers is examined, and the roleof delay in the employment dispute resolution process analysed. Methods ofalleviating delay within the current system are put forward.1 Also referred to as “illegal” or “undocumented” migrant workers.4Working Towards EqualityConclusionMigrant workers are experiencing exploitation in Ireland and this thesis concludesthat this is due in part to the obstacles that are currently operating under theemployment system in Ireland. The obstacles that operate during recruitment,employment and in accessing justice are preventing migrant workers fromachieving equality in employment law with Irish nationals. Until a more equitableemployment process is developed, migrant workers will continue to face thedangers of exploitation that the GAMA and Irish Ferries situations presented inIreland.

Is there Equity in HPV vaccination and Cervical Screening in the North West of England? : A Study of Mothers and Daughters
IntroductionCervical screening uptake is steadily declining with evidence of inequalities by deprivation and ethnicity. The introduction of the HPV vaccination programme has the potential to reverse the downward trend in cervical cancer prevention by protecting girls who in future may not attend for cervical screening.ObjectiveTo investigate equity in cervical cancer prevention by examining uptake of adolescent HPV vaccination of daughters and cervical cancer screening attendance in their mothers. Methods HPV vaccination records of girls aged 12-13 years were linked by address to their mothers cervical screening records from 15 North West Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) (n = 24,409 mother-daughter pairs).  Vaccination and Screening records were matched to deprivation quintiles (as measured by the 2007 Index of Multiple Deprivation IMD scores) and ethnicity (classified by South Asian ethnicity using the Nam Pehchan computer programme). Results Results from preliminary analysis show daughters vaccination completion was associated with mothers screening attendance. Screening uptake was significantly lower in mothers whose daughters had received no vaccination doses compared to those that had received three doses (Odds Ratio OR = 1.35; 95% Confidence Interval CI 1.24 to 1.47) or partial immunisation status (OR=1.19; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.35).  Uptake of both vaccination and screening programmes were associated with deprivation quintile (Chi Square, p<0.0001) and ethnicity, with uptake significantly lower in South Asian groups (Cervical screening = Chi Square p<0.05, HPV vaccination p<0.0001).   Conclusion Mother’s behaviour towards cervical screening appears to be indicative of HPV uptake in daughters. The HPV vaccination programme may therefore be subject to the same inequalities in coverage as the cervical screening programme.

Transiting circumbinary planets Kepler-34 b and Kepler-35 b
Most Sun-like stars in the Galaxy reside in gravitationally bound pairs of stars (binaries). Although long anticipated the existence of a ‘circumbinary planet’ orbiting such a pair of normal stars was not definitively established until the discovery9 of the planet transiting (that is, passing in front of) Kepler-16. Questions remained, however, about the prevalence of circumbinary planets and their range of orbital and physical properties. Here we report two additional transiting circumbinary planets: Kepler-34 (AB)b and Kepler-35 (AB)b, referred to here as Kepler-34 b and Kepler-35 b, respectively. Each is a low-density gas-giant planet on an orbit closely aligned with that of its parent stars. Kepler-34 b orbits two Sun-like stars every 289 days, whereas Kepler-35 b orbits a pair of smaller stars (89% and 81% of the Sun’s mass) every 131 days. The planets experience large multi-periodic variations in incident stellar radiation arising from the orbital motion of the stars. The observed rate of circumbinary planets in our sample implies that more than ~1% of close binary stars have giant planets in nearly coplanar orbits, yielding a Galactic population of at least several million.

High-temperature superconductivity at the FeSe/SrTiOsubscript 3 interface
In several recent experiments the superconducting gap of a single-unit-cell-thick FeSe film on SrTiOsubscript 3 substrate has been observed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The value of the superconducting gap is about nine times larger than that of the bulk FeSe under ambient pressure, suggesting a much higher pairing energy scale and Tsubscript c than all other iron-based superconductors and thus calling for a better understanding of its superconducting mechanism. In this paper we study the effects of screening due to the SrTiOsubscript 3 ferroelectric phonons on Cooper pairing in FeSe. We conclude that it can significantly enhance the energy scale of Cooper pairing and even change the pairing symmetry. Our results also raise some concerns on whether phonons can be completely ignored for bulk iron-based superconductors.

[bowel, syndrome, disorder, irritable, patient]

The irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is a common disorder varying in severity from trivial to incapacitating. The pathophysiology and epidemiology are gradually being unravelled and it is now becoming apparent just how poor the quality of life of some of these patients can be. It is no longer acceptable practice to diagnose the condition and discharge the patient on a high fibre diet, particularly as the latter can often make the situation worse. Although hard to treat, worthwhile responses can be achieved by careful targeting of therapy to the many different facets of the disorder.

Transforming growth factor β-induced peritoneal fibrosis is mouse strain dependent.
BackgroundEncapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) is a rare but devastating complication of peritoneal dialysis. The etiology is unclear, but genetic predisposition may be a contributing factor. We used adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of transforming growth factor (TGF) β1 to the peritoneum in four genetically distinct laboratory mouse strains to assess differences in fibrogenic response.MethodsMice from four genetic backgrounds (C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, C3H/HeJ and SJL/J) received an intraperitoneal injection of an adenovirus expressing TGFβ1 (AdTGFβ1) or control adenovirus (AdDL) and were assessed 4 and 10 days after infection. Submesothelial thickening, angiogenesis and gene expression were quantified from peritoneal tissue. Protein was extracted from omental tissue and assessed for collagen, E-cadherin and TGFβ signaling pathway proteins.ResultsThere was a graded response among the mouse strains to the peritoneal overexpression of TGFβ1. TGFβ1 induced a significant fibrogenic response in the C57BL/6J mice, whereas the SJL/J mice were resistant. The DBA/2J and the C3H/HeJ mice had intermediate responses. A similar graded response was seen in collagen protein levels in the omental tissue and in fibrosis-associated gene expression. TGFβ type 1 receptor and SMAD signaling pathways appeared to be intact in all the mouse strains.ConclusionsThere were significant differences in mouse strain susceptibility to peritoneal fibrosis, suggesting that genetic factors may play a role in the development of peritoneal fibrosis and possibly EPS. As early TGFβ1 signaling mechanisms appear to be intact, we hypothesize that fibrosis resistance in the SJL/J mice lies further down the wound-healing cascade or in an alternate, non-SMAD pathway.

Examining fatigue in COPD: development, validity and reliability of a modified version of FACIT-F scale.
INTRODUCTION: Fatigue is a disruptive symptom that inhibits normal functional performance of COPD patients in daily activities. The availability of a short, simple, reliable and valid scale would improve assessment of the characteristics and influence of fatigue in COPD. METHODS: At baseline, 2107 COPD patients from the ECLIPSE cohort completed the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue (FACIT-F) scale. We used well-structured classic method, the principal components analysis (PCA) and Rasch analysis for structurally examining the 13-item FACIT-F. RESULTS: Four items were less able to capture fatigue characteristics in COPD and were deleted. PCA was applied to the remaining 9 items of the modified FACIT-F and resulted in three interpretable dimensions: i) general (5 items); ii) functional ability (2 items); and iii) psychosocial fatigue (2 items). The modified FACIT-F had high internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.91) and it did not fit a uni-dimensional Rasch model, confirming the prior output from the PCA. The correlations between total score and each dimension were ≥ 0.64 and within dimensions ≥0.43 (p < 0.001 for all).The original and modified FACIT-F had significant convergent validity; its scores were associated with SGRQ total score (0.69 and 0.7) and mMRC dyspnoea scores (0.48 and 0.47), (p = <0.001 for all). The scale had meaningful discriminating ability in identifying patients with poor exercise performance and more depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: The original and modified FACIT-F are valid and reliable scales in COPD. The modified version is shorter and measures not only total fatigue but also its sub-components in COPD.

Predicting the differential susceptibility of dermal extracellular matrix proteins to photodegradation by solar-simulated radiation
Bioscience, University Sydney, AUPhotoaged skin is characterised by profound remodelling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). We have previously shown that UV chromophore (Cys, His, Phe, Trp and Tyr)-rich proteins are differentially degraded by UV radiation (UVR). We tested the hypothesises that; (i) UV-mediated ECM degradation occurs via reactive oxygen species (ROS), by exposing chromophore-rich fibronectin and chromophore-poor tropoelastin to UVR in depleted-O2 and D2O environments and (ii) exogenous ROS mediates differential degradation of the same proteins. As the photodynamic production of ROS can be inhibited in depleted-O2 environments we exposed purified fibronectin to a broadband UVB (TL-12: 50 and 500mJ/cm2) in ambient and depleted-O2 conditions by bubbling with N2. Solutions were analysed by reducing SDS-PAGE. Irradiation of fibronectin in ambient-O2 (50 and 500mJ/cm2) caused dose-dependent aggregation (5 and 83 fold changes in the optical density (OD) of the aggregate at 50 and 500mJ/cm2 respectively), fibronectin aggregation was abrogated (68 fold lower OD) in the depleted-O2 compared with ambient-O2. Conversely, fibronectin aggregation was increased 4 fold in D2O compared with H2O environments. UV-mediated changes to the molecular weight (Mw) of fibronectin were recapitulated by exposure to H2O2 (40mM for 2 hrs). In contrast, UVB irradiation in both H2O and D2O had no observable effect on the Mw of tropoelastin. Therefore, ROS may play an important role in the selective degradation of long-lived UV chromophore-rich ECM in both UV-exposed and protected ageing tissues. Research supported by Alliance Boots.

[gag, surface, protein, amine, allyl, heparin, microtiter, binding, array]

Development of a microtiter plate-based glycosaminoglycan array for the investigation of glycosaminoglycan-protein interactions.
The interactions of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) with proteins underlie a wide range of important biological processes. However, the study of such binding reactions has been hampered by the lack of a simple frontline analysis technique. Previously, we have reported that cold plasma polymerization can be used to coat microtiter plate surfaces with allyl amine to which GAGs (e.g., heparin) can be noncovalently immobilized retaining their ability to interact with proteins. Here, we have assessed the capabilities of surface coats derived from different ratios of allyl amine and octadiene (100:0 to 0:100) to support the binding of diverse GAGs (e.g., chondroitin-4-sulfate, dermatan sulfate, heparin preparations, and hyaluronan) in a functionally active state. The Link module from TSG-6 was used as a probe to determine the level of functional binding because of its broad (and unique) specificity for both sulfated and nonsulfated GAGs. All of the GAGs tested could bind this domain following their immobilization, although there were clear differences in their protein-binding activities depending on the surface chemistry to which they were adsorbed. On the basis of these experiments, 100% allyl amine was chosen for the generation of a microtiter plate-based "sugar array"; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that similar relative amounts of chondroitin-4-sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and heparin (including two selectively de-sulfated derivatives) were immobilized onto this surface. Analysis of four unrelated proteins (i.e., TSG-6, complement factor H, fibrillin-1, and versican) illustrated the utility of this array to determine the GAG-binding profile and specificity for a particular target protein.

Assessing the malignant potential of ovarian inclusion cysts in postmenopausal women within the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS): a prospective cohort study.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the malignant potential of ultrasound-detected ovarian inclusion cysts in the development of ovarian cancer (OC) in postmenopausal women. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS). POPULATION: Postmenopausal women. METHODS: In UKCTOCS, women in the ultrasound group have annual scans. Women with inclusion cysts (single/multiple anechoic ≤10-mm ovarian cysts) and normal ovaries (both uniform hypoechogenicity) on their first scan were identified and followed up through cancer registry/questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relative risk (RR) of developing OC, invasive epithelial ovarian cancer (iEOC), breast cancer (BC) and endometrial cancer (EC) in women with inclusion cysts relative to those with normal ovaries. The incidence was compared with UK age-adjusted expected rates (Office for National Statistics, 2005). RESULTS: Postmenopausal women (n = 48,230) attended the year 1 (11 June 2001-6 December 2006) screen; 1234 (2.5%) had inclusion cysts alone and 22,914 had normal scans. By 1 November 2009 (median follow-up, 6.13 years; interquartile range, 4.96-6.98 years), four, three (one Type II), seven and 22 women with inclusion cysts and 32, 29 (20 Type II), 90 and 397 women with normal ovaries were diagnosed with OC, iEOC, EC and BC, respectively. The RR values for the respective cancers (OC RR, 2.32; confidence interval CI, 0.86-6.28, iEOC RR, 1.92; CI, 0.62-5.92, EC RR, 1.44; CI, 0.68-3.05, BC RR, 1.12; CI, 0.73-1.73) were not increased. There was no difference between the observed versus expected incidence rates for these cancers in women with inclusion cysts. CONCLUSIONS: Postmenopausal women with ultrasound-detected inclusion cysts do not seem to be at increased risk of ovarian or breast/endometrial (hormone-dependent) cancers.

Redox cycling of arsenic by the hydrothermal marine bacterium Marinobacter santoriniensis
Marinobacter santoriniensis NKSG1(T) is a mesophilic, dissimilatory arsenate-reducing and arsenite-oxidizing bacterium isolated from an arsenate-reducing enrichment culture. The inoculum was obtained from arsenic-rich shallow marine hydrothermal sediment from Santorini, Greece, with evidence of arsenic redox cycling. Growth studies demonstrated M. santoriniensis NKSG1(T) is capable of conserving energy from the reduction of arsenate {}As(V) with acetate or lactate as the electron donor, and of oxidizing arsenite {}As(III) heterotrophically with oxygen as the electron acceptor. The oxidation of As(III) coincided with the expression of the aoxB gene encoding for the catalytic molybdopterin subunit of the heterodimeric arsenite oxidase operon, indicating the reaction is enzymatically controlled, and M. santoriniensis NKSG1(T) is a heterotrophic As(III)-oxidizing bacterium. Although it is clear that this organism also performs dissimilatory As(V) reduction, no amplification of the arrA arsenate reductase gene was attained using a range of primers and PCR conditions. Marinobacter santoriniensis NKSG1(T) belongs to a genus of bacteria widely occurring in marine environments, including hydrothermal sediments, and is among the first marine bacteria shown to be capable of either anaerobic As(V) respiration or aerobic As(III) oxidation.

Investigation of the Effect of Deprivation on the Burden and Management of Venous Leg Ulcers: A Cohort Study Using the THIN Database.
BACKGROUND: There has been limited examination of the contribution of socio-economic factors to the development of leg ulcers, despite the social patterning of many underlying risk factors. No previous studies were found that examined social patterns in the quality of treatment received by patients with leg ulcers. METHODS: Using The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database we identified a cohort of over 14000 patients with a diagnosis of venous leg ulceration, prospectively recorded between the years 2001 and 2006, with linked area-level socio-economic information (Townsend deprivation quintile). We assessed socio-economic differences in the incidence and prevalence of leg ulcers using negative binomial regression. Socio-economic differences in two key areas of guideline recommended leg ulcer management, arterial Doppler assessment and compression bandaging, were assessed using multilevel regression. RESULTS: The risk of incident venous leg ulceration increased for patients living in areas of higher deprivation, even after adjustment for known risk factors age and gender. Overall reported rates of Doppler assessment and provision of compression therapy were low, with less than sixteen per cent of patients having a database record of receiving these recommended diagnostic and treatment options. Patients diagnosed with incident venous leg ulcers living in the most deprived areas were less likely to receive the recommended Doppler-aided assessment for peripheral vascular disease than patients living in the least deprived areas (odds ratio 0.43, 95% confidence interval 0.24-0.78). Documented provision of compression therapy did not vary with deprivation. CONCLUSIONS: A socio-economic gradient in venous leg ulcer disease was observed. The overall rates of people with venous leg ulcers who were documented as receiving guideline recommended care (2001-2006) were low. Reported use of Doppler ultrasound assessment was negatively associated with socio-economic status. These findings suggest that the inequalities experienced by leg ulcer patients may be exacerbated by reduced access to guideline-based management.

The reverse Warburg effect: glycolysis inhibitors prevent the tumor promoting effects of caveolin-1 deficient cancer associated fibroblasts.
We and others have previously identified a loss of stromal caveolin-1 (Cav-1) in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as a powerful single independent predictor of breast cancer patient tumor recurrence, metastasis, tamoxifen-resistance, and poor clinical outcome. However, it remains unknown how loss of stromal Cav-1 mediates these effects clinically. To mechanistically address this issue, we have now generated a novel human tumor xenograft model. In this two-component system, nude mice are co-injected with i) human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231), and ii) stromal fibroblasts (wild-type (WT) versus Cav-1 (-/-) deficient). This allowed us to directly evaluate the effects of a Cav-1 deficiency solely in the tumor stromal compartment. Here, we show that Cav-1-deficient stromal fibroblasts are sufficient to promote both tumor growth and angiogenesis, and to recruit Cav-1 (+) micro-vascular cells. Proteomic analysis of Cav-1-deficient stromal fibroblasts indicates that these cells upregulate the expression of glycolytic enzymes, a hallmark of aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect). Thus, Cav-1-deficient stromal fibroblasts may contribute towards tumor growth and angiogenesis, by providing energy-rich metabolites in a paracrine fashion. We have previously termed this new idea the "Reverse Warburg Effect". In direct support of this notion, treatment of this xenograft model with glycolysis inhibitors functionally blocks the positive effects of Cav-1-deficient stromal fibroblasts on breast cancer tumor growth. Thus, pharmacologically-induced metabolic restriction (via treatment with glycolysis inhibitors) may be a promising new therapeutic strategy for breast cancer patients that lack stromal Cav-1 expression. We also identify the stromal expression of PKM2 and LDH-B as new candidate biomarkers for the "Reverse Warburg Effect" or "Stromal-Epithelial Metabolic Coupling" in human breast cancers.

Elevated serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II and IGF binding protein-2 in patients with colorectal cancer
This study explored the relationships of serum insulin-like growth factors, IGF-I and IGF-II, and their binding proteins (IGFBP)-2 and IGFBP-3, with key clinicopathological parameters in 92 patients with colorectal cancer (cases). Comparisons were made with 57 individuals who had a normal colonoscopy (controls). Serial changes were examined in 27 cases. As IGF-related peptides are age- and sex-dependent, absolute concentrations were converted to standard deviation scores (SDS). Mean IGF-II SDS were elevated in Dukes A (n = 12, P&lt; 0.001) and Dukes B (n = 25, P&lt; 0.001) cases compared with controls, but not in advanced disease. Compared with controls, mean IGFBP-2 SDS were significantly elevated in patients with Dukes B (P&lt; 0.001), Dukes C (n = 13, P&lt; 0.001) and advanced disease (n = 42, P&lt; 0.0001), with a significant trend from early to advanced disease (one-way ANOVA, P&lt; 0.001). Furthermore, IGFBP-2 SDS were positively related to tumour size (P = 0.01) and fell significantly in patients following curative resection (P = 0.04), suggesting that circulating levels reflect tumour load. We tested the potential tumour marker characteristics of IGFBP-2 SDS against three endpoints: metastasis alone; local pelvic recurrence alone; and metastasis and recurrence combined. The sensitivities for IGFBP-2 alone (&gt;/= + 2SD) were modest at 55%, 46%, and 52%, but in combination with CEA, increased substantially to 90%, 77% and 86%, respectively. We conclude that the serum IGF-II and IGFBP-2 profiles may provide insights into underlying biological mechanisms, and that serum IGFBP-2 may have an adjunct role in cancer surveillance in patients with colorectal cancer.

Analysis of circulating tumor cells in patients with non-small cell lung cancer using epithelial marker-dependent and -independent approaches.
INTRODUCTION: Epithelial circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are detectable in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, a widely reported prerequisite for metastasis, may lead to an underestimation of CTC number. We compared directly an epithelial marker-dependent (CellSearch) and a marker-independent (isolation by size of epithelial tumor cells ISET) technology platform for the ability to identify CTCs. Molecular characteristics of CTCs were also explored. METHODS: Paired peripheral blood samples were collected from 40 chemonäive, stages IIIA to IV NSCLC patients. CTCs were enumerated by Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-based immunomagnetic capture (CellSearch, Veridex) and by filtration (ISET, RareCell Diagnostics). CTCs isolated by filtration were assessed by immunohistochemistry for epithelial marker expression (cytokeratins, Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule, epidermal growth factor receptor) and for proliferation status (Ki67). RESULTS: CTCs were detected using ISET in 32 of 40 (80%) patients compared with 9 of 40 (23%) patients using CellSearch. A subpopulation of CTCs isolated by ISET did not express epithelial markers. Circulating tumor microemboli (CTM, clusters of ≥ 3 CTCs) were observed in 43% patients using ISET but were undetectable by CellSearch. Up to 62% of single CTCs were positive for the proliferation marker Ki67, whereas cells within CTM were nonproliferative. CONCLUSIONS: Both technology platforms detected NSCLC CTCs. ISET detected higher numbers of CTCs including epithelial marker negative tumor cells. ISET also isolated CTM and permitted molecular characterization. Combined with our previous CellSearch data confirming CTC number as an independent prognostic biomarker for NSCLC, we propose that this complementary dual technology approach to CTC analysis allows more complete exploration of CTCs in patients with NSCLC.

Mantle upwelling, melt generation, and magma transport beneath mid-ocean ridges
The formation of new oceanic crust is the result of a complex geodynamic system in
which mantle rises beneath spreading centers and undergoes decompression melting. The
melt segregates from the matrix and is focused to the rise axis, where it is eventually
intruded and/or erupted to form the oceanic crust. This thesis combines surface
observations with laboratory studies and geodynamic modeling to study this crustal-production
system. Quantitative modeling of the crustal and mantle contributions to the
axial gravity and topography observed at the East Pacific Rise shows that the retained melt
fraction in the mantle is small (<3%) and is focused into a narrow column extending up to
70 km beneath the ridge axis. Consistent with geochemical constraints, the extraction of
melt from the mantle therefore appears to be efficiently focus melt toward the ridge axis. A
combination of laboratory and numerical studies are used to constrain the pattern of mantle
flow beneath highly-segmented ridges. Even when the buoyant component of mantle flow
is constrained to be two-dimensional, laboratory studies show that a segmented ridge will
drive three-dimensional mantle upwelling. However, using reasonable mantle parameters
in numerical models, it is difficult to induce large-amplitude three-dimensional mantle
upwelling at the relatively short wavelengths of individual segments (~50 km). Instead, a
simple model of three-dimensional melt migration shows that the observed segment-scale
variations in crustal thickness can be explained by focusing of melt as it upwells through a
more two-dimensional mantle flow field. At the Reykjanes Ridge, the melt appears to
accumulate in small crustal magma chambers, before erupting in small batches to form
numerous overlapping hummocky lava flows and small volcanoes. This suggests that
crustal accretion, particularly at slow-spreading centers, may be a highly discontinuous
process. Long-wavelength variations in crustal accretion may be dominated by variations in
mantle upwelling while short-wavelength, segment-scale variations are more likely
controlled by a complex three-dimensional processes of melt extraction and magma
eruption.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution March 1997During my first three years in the Joint Program, I was supported by an National

On nonlinear dimensionality reduction for face recognition
The curse of dimensionality has prompted intensive research in effective methods of mapping high dimensional data. Dimensionality reduction and subspace learning have been studied extensively and widely applied to feature extraction and pattern representation in image and vision applications. Although PCA has long been regarded as a simple, efficient linear subspace technique, many nonlinear methods such as kernel PCA, local linear embedding, and self-organizing networks have been proposed recently for dealing with increasingly complex nonlinear data. The intensive research in nonlinear methods often creates an impression that they are highly superior and preferred, though often limited experiments were given and the results not tested on significance. In this paper, we systematically investigate and compare the capabilities of various linearand nonlinear subspace methods for face representation and recognition. The performances of these methods are analyzed and discussed along with statistical significance tests on obtained results. The experiments on a range of data sets show that nonlinear methods do not always outperform linear ones, especiallyon data sets containing noise and outliers or having discontinuous or multiple submanifolds. Certain nonlinear methods with certain classifiers do yield better performances consistently than others. However, the differences among them are small and in most cases are not significant. A measure is used to quantify thenonlinearity of a data set in a subspace. It explains that good performances are achievable in reduced dimensions of low degree of nonlinearity.

Tetrachlorobiphenyl metabolism, toxicity, and regulation of cytochrome P50 expression in a marine teleost fish
The effects of 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (TCB) were examined in the marine
fish scup (Stenotomus chrysops), focusing on the interactions between TCB and the
CYP 1 A 1 enzyme system. A low TCB dose (0.1 mg/kg) elicited strong and sustained
induction of hepatic CYP1A1 mRNA, protein content, and catalytic activity. A high TCB
dose (5.0 mg/kg) elicited similar, strong induction of hepatic CYP1A1 mRNA, but not of
CYP1A1 protein content or catalytic activity. This post-transcriptional "suppression" at the
high TCB dose was specific for CYP1A1, and was not seen with other hepatic enzymes.
In vitro studies indicate that hepatic microsomal CYP1A1 is inactivated in the presence of
TCB plus cofactor, likely due to the production of reactive oxygen species during TCB
occupation of the active site. CYP1A1 inactivation by TCB in vitro may explain the TCB-elicited
suppression of CYPlAl protein content in vivo.
Both TCB doses elicited strong CYP1A1 induction in vascular endothelium of all
organs, which was sustained for several weeks. Induction in intestinal epithelia was
stronger at the high TCB dose, but induction in epithelia of liver, kidney, and gill were
stronger at the low TCB dose. Both TCB doses caused proliferation of endoplasmic
reticulum in liver, renal tubule necrosis, depletion of hematopoietic tissue in kidney,
hyperplasia of gill epithelia, and increased number of melanomacrophage aggregates in
spleen. The high dose induced tail fin erosion, affecting both epithelial and calcified bone
tissue. Tissue alterations were more severe at the high TCB dose, and repair of lesions
occurred by day 16 at the low dose. The high dose caused mortality of many individuals.
The two TCB congeners 3,3',4,4'-TCB and 2,2',5,5'-TCB were each converted to
aqueous-soluble metabolites by hepatic microsomes from scup, beluga whale, and pilot
whale. Induction response, correlation analysis, and inhibition studies indicate that
3,3',4,4'-TCB is metabolized by scup CYP1A1, and 2,2',5,5'-TCB by the putative scup
CYP2B. Correlation analysis and inhibition studies suggest that 3,3',4,4'-TCB is
metabolized by cetacean CYP1A. Both cetacean species expressed microsomal proteins
that are immunochemically related to mammalian CYP2B forms. Cytochrome P450
systems from both cetacean species are partially characterized here.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology November 1994This research was funded in part by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology I

This study examines the economic factors which influence the rice import demand in Nigeria between 1970 and 2008. The quantity of rice imports was considered as a function of factors such as the amount of the lagged import, exchange rate, external reserves, structural adjustment programme (SAP), per capita income and import price of rice. However, quantitative estimates, based on cointegration and error correction specification using the Bound's testing approach, indicate that per capita income is the most important determinant of rice import in Nigeria. The results further alludes that, the error correction mechanism (ECM) indicated a feedback of about 16.9 % of the previous year's disequilibrium from long-run wheat import.&nbsp; It is concluded that for the Nigerian government to reduce importation of rice in the face of increasing rice demand without exacerbating food security problem, then Nigeria should as a matter of urgency put in place policy measures that will significantly improve local rice production and processing. &nbsp; KEYWORDS: Rice, demand, import, SAP, ARDL, error correction mechanism, co-integration

IL-2 induces in vivo suppression by CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells.
Interleukin-2 (IL-2) treatment is currently used to enhance T cell-mediated immune responses against tumors or in viral infections. At the same time, IL-2 is essential for the peripheral homeostasis of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+ )regulatory T cells (Treg). In our study, we show that IL-2 is also an important activator of Treg suppressive activity in vivo. IL-2 treatment induces Treg expansion as well as IL-10 production and increases their suppressive potential in vitro. Importantly, in vivo application of IL-2 via gene-gun vaccination using IL-2 encoding DNA plasmids (pIL-2) inhibited naive antigen-specific T cell proliferation as well as a Th1-induced delayed type hypersensitivity response. The suppressive effect can be transferred onto naive animals by Treg from IL-2-treated mice and the suppression depends on the synergistic action of IL-10 and TGF-beta. These data highlight that during therapeutic treatment with IL-2 the concomitant activation of Treg may indeed counteract the intended activation of cellular immunity.

Sex-specific differences in effect size estimates at established complex trait loci.
BACKGROUND: Genetic differences between men and women may contribute to sex differences in prevalence and progression of many common complex diseases.Using the WTCCC GWAS, we analysed whether there are sex-specific differences in effect size estimates at 142 established loci for seven complex diseases: rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes (T1D), Crohn's disease, type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, coronary artery disease and bipolar disorder. METHODS: For each Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), we calculated the per-allele odds ratio for each sex and the relative odds ratios (RORs; the effect size is higher in men with ROR greater than one). RORs were then meta-analysed across loci within each disease and across diseases. RESULTS: For each disease, summary RORs were not different from one, but there was between-SNP heterogeneity in the RORs for T1D and T2D. Four loci in T1D, three in Crohn's disease and three in T2D showed differences in the genetic effect between men and women (P < 0.05). We probed these differences in additional independent replication samples for T1D and T2D. The differences remained for the T1D loci CTSH, 17q21 and 20p13 and the T2D locus BCL11A, when WTCCC data and replication data were meta-analysed. Only CTSH showed different genetic effect between men and women in the replication data alone. CONCLUSION: Our results exclude the presence of large and frequent differences in the effect size estimates between men and women for the established loci in the seven common diseases explored. Documenting small differences in genetic effects between men and women requires large studies and systematic evaluation.

Corneal confocal microscopy detects small-fiber neuropathy in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A patients.
INTRODUCTION: Although unmyelinated nerve fibers are affected in Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A) disease, they have not been studied in detail due to the invasive nature of the techniques needed to study them. We established alterations in C-fiber bundles of the cornea in patients with CMT1A using non-invasive corneal confocal microscopy (CCM). METHODS: Twelve patients with CMT1A and 12 healthy control subjects underwent assessment of neuropathic symptoms and deficits, electrophysiology, quantitative sensory testing, corneal sensitivity, and corneal confocal microscopy. RESULTS: Corneal sensitivity, corneal nerve fiber density, corneal nerve branch density, corneal nerve fiber length, and corneal nerve fiber tortuosity were significantly reduced in CMT1A patients compared with controls. There was a significant correlation between corneal sensation and CCM parameters with the severity of painful neuropathic symptoms, cold and warm thresholds, and median nerve CMAP amplitude. CONCLUSIONS: CCM demonstrates significant damage to C-fiber bundles, which relates to some measures of neuropathy in CMT1A patients.

Multidisciplinary rehabilitation for people with Parkinson's disease: a randomised controlled study
<p><b>Objective: </b>To determine whether a programme of multidisciplinary rehabilitation and group support
achieves sustained benefit for people with Parkinson’s disease or their carers.
</p>
<p><b>Methods:</b> The study was a randomised controlled crossover trial comparing patients and carers who
had received rehabilitation four months before assessment with those who had not. Patients were
recruited from a neurology clinic, attended a day hospital from home weekly for six weeks using private
car or hospital transport, and received group educational activities and individual rehabilitation
from a multidisciplinary team. Patients were assessed at entry and at six months using a 25 item self
assessment Parkinson’s disease disability questionnaire, Euroqol-5d, SF-36, PDQ-39, hospital anxiety
and depression scale, and timed stand-walk-sit test. Carers were assessed using the carer strain index
and Euroqol-5d.
</p>
<p><b>Results:</b> 144 people with Parkinson’s disease without severe cognitive losses and able to travel to hospital
were registered (seven were duplicate registrations); 94 had assessments at baseline and six
months. Repeated measures analysis of variance comparing patients at the 24 week crossover point
showed that those receiving rehabilitation had a trend towards better stand-walk-sit score (p = 0.093)
and worse general and mental health (p = 0.002, p = 0.019). Carers of treated patients had a trend
towards more strain (p = 0.086). Analysis comparing patients before and six months after treatment
showed worsening in disability, quality of life, and carer strain.
</p>
<p><b>Conclusions: </b>Patients with Parkinson’s disease decline significantly over six months, but a short spell
of multidisciplinary rehabilitation may improve mobility. Follow up treatments may be needed to maintain
any benefit.</p>

[ldl, change, particle, small, dense, density, triglyceride, loss, peak]

The metabolic inter-relationships between changes in waist circumference, triglycerides, insulin sensitivity and small, dense low-density lipoprotein particles with acute weight loss in clinically obese children and adolescents.
WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT: Small, dense LDL is highly atherogenic and the prevalence is higher in obesity. Weight loss lowers the prevalence of small, dense LDL. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: The important role of TG in lowering LDL peak particle density and the proportion of small, dense LDL particles. Waist or insulin resistance were not predictive of these important changes in LDL characteristics. OBJECTIVE: Small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles are highly atherogenic and strongly associated with obesity-related dyslipidemia. The metabolic inter-relationships between weight loss induced changes in waist circumference, triglycerides, insulin sensitivity and small-dense LDL particles in clinically obese children and adolescents have not been studied. METHODS: Seventy-five clinically obese boys and girls (standardized body mass index 3.07 ± 0.59, aged 8-18 years) were recruited. Anthropometric, body composition and cardiometabolic risk factors were measured pre- and post-weight loss. RESULTS: There were highly significant reductions in anthropometric, body composition and cardiometabolic risk factors. Triglyceride change was positively correlated with LDL peak particle density and percentage LDL pattern B changes (relative abundance of small, dense LDL particles). Multiple regression analyses showed that changes in triglyceride concentration accounted for between 24 and 18% of the variance in LDL peak particle density and percentage LDL pattern B change, respectively. Changes in waist circumference and insulin sensitivity did not predict these changes in LDL characteristics. CONCLUSION: Acute and highly significant weight loss significantly decreased LDL peak particle density and percentage LDL pattern B. The change in triglycerides was a strong predictor of LDL peak particle density and percentage LDL pattern B change.

3D virtual worlds as environments for literacy learning
<b>Background:</b> Although much has been written about the ways in which new technology might transform educational practice, particularly in the area of literacy learning, there is relatively little empirical work that explores the possibilities and problems - or even what such a transformation might look like in the classroom. 3D virtual worlds offer a range of opportunities for children to use digital literacies in school, and suggest one way in which we might explore changing literacy practices in a playful, yet meaningful context.<p></p> <b>Purpose:</b> This paper identifies some of the key issues that emerged in designing and implementing virtual world work in a small number of primary schools in the UK. It examines the tensions between different discourses about literacy and literacy learning and shows how these were played out by teachers and pupils in classroom settings.<p></p><b>Sources of evidence:</b> Case study data are used as a basis for exploring and illustrating key aspects of design and implementation. The case study material includes views from a number of perspectives including classroom observations, chatlogs, in-world avatar interviews with teachers and also pupils, as well as the author’s field notes of the planning process with accompanying minutes and meeting documents.<p></p><b>Main argument:</b> From a Foucauldian perspective, the article suggests that social control of pedagogical practice through the regulation of curriculum time, the normalisation of teaching routines and the regimes of individual assessment restricts teachers’ and pupils’ conceptions of what constitutes literacy. The counternarrative, found in recent work in new litearcies (Lankshear & Knobel, 2006) provides an attractive alternative, but a movement in this direction requires a fundamental shift of emphasis and a re-conceptualisation of what counts as learning.<p></p><b>Conclusions:</b> This work on 3D virtual worlds questions the notion of how transformative practice can be achieved with the use of new technologies. It suggests that changes in teacher preparation, continuing professional development as well as wider educational reform may be needed.

Reduced neutron spectroscopic factors when using potential geometries constrained by Hartree-Fock calculations
<p>We carry out a systematic analysis of angular distribution measurements for selected ground-state to ground-state (d,p) and (p,d) neutron transfer reactions, including the calcium isotopes. We propose a consistent three-body model reaction methodology in which we constrain the transferred-neutron bound state and nucleon-target optical potential geometries using modern Hartree-Fock calculations. Our deduced neutron spectroscopic factors are found to be suppressed by similar to 30% relative to independent-particle shell-model values, from Ca-40 through Ca-49. The other nuclei studied, ranging from B to Ti, show similar average suppressions with respect to large-basis shell-model expectations. Our results are consistent with deduced spectroscopic strengths for neutrons and protons from intermediate-energy nucleon knockout reactions and for protons from (e,e(')p) reactions on well-bound nuclei.</p>

Radiative Corrections to Scalar Masses and Mixing in a Scale Invariant Two Higgs Doublet Model
We study the Higgs boson mass spectrum of a classical scale invariant realization of the two Higgs doublet model (SI-2HDM). The classical scale symmetry of the theory is explicitly broken by quantum loop effects due to gauge interactions, Higgs self-couplings and top quark Yukawa couplings. We determine the allowed parameter space compatible with perturbative unitarity and electroweak precision data. Taking into account the LEP and the recent LHC exclusion limits on a standard-model-like Higgs boson HSM, we obtain rather strict constraints on the mass spectrum of the heavy Higgs sector of the SI-2HDM. In particular, if MHSM 125 GeV, the SI-2HDM strongly favors scenarios in which at least one of the nonstandard neutral Higgs bosons has a mass close to 400 GeV and is generically degenerate with the charged Higgs boson, whilst the third neutral Higgs scalar is lighter than 500 GeV.

Human papillomavirus as a target for management, prevention and therapy.
The discovery that human papillomavirus (HPV) is the necessary causal factor in cervical carcinogenesis has made it a target for prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines, as well as a diagnostic tool in cervical screening. Whilst prophylactic vaccination has proven very effective in terms of preventing cervical cancer precursor lesions, therapeutic strategies have presented far greater challenges. HPV testing has shown itself to be extremely valuable in the triage of low grade cytological abnormalities, test of cure following treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and will, over the next 10 years, gradually replace cytology as the mainstay of primary cervical screening. In this review, the latest evidence supporting HPV as both a biomarker of risk for cervical cancer and a target for prophylactic and therapeutic vaccination is presented.

[emotion, negative, mdd, bias, proneness, increase]

Proneness to Decreased Negative Emotions in Major Depressive Disorder when Blaming Others rather than Oneself.
Background: One widespread view holds that vulnerability to major depressive disorder (MDD) is linked to overall increases in negative emotionality. In contrast, cognitive attribution theories emphasize the importance of blaming oneself rather than others for negative events. Thus far, the contrasting predictions of these models have not been directly compared. Following the attributional perspective, we tested the hypothesis that people with remitted MDD show no overall bias towards negative emotions, but a selective bias towards self-blaming emotions relative to those emotions associated with blaming others. Sampling and Methods: We compared a remitted MDD and a control group on a novel experimental test that allowed us to directly compare proneness to specific emotions associated with different types of self-blame (guilt, shame, self-contempt/disgust) and blame of others (other-indignation/anger, other-contempt/disgust) whilst controlling for negative valence and medication status, and excluding comorbidity. Results: In agreement with our hypothesis, individuals with remitted MDD exhibited an increased self-contempt bias (difference between contempt/disgust towards self and others) but no increased proneness to any other negative emotion or overall increases in perceived negative valence of stimuli. Moreover, the remitted MDD group exhibited reduced contempt/disgust towards others. Conclusions: Our results corroborate the prediction that vulnerability to MDD is associated with an imbalance of specific self- and other-blaming emotions rather than a general increase in negative emotions. Based on the composition of our sample, we speculate that self-contempt bias may be particularly characteristic of melancholic MDD subtypes and could be useful for stratification of depression in the future.

Characterisation of the in vitro activity of the depsipeptide histone deacetylase inhibitor spiruchostatin A.
We recently completed the total synthesis of spiruchostatin A, a depsipeptide natural product with close structural similarities to FK228, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (HDI) currently being evaluated in clinical trials for cancer. Here we report a detailed characterisation of the in vitro activity of spiruchostatin A. Spiruchostatin A was a potent (sub-nM) inhibitor of class I HDAC activity in vitro and acted as a prodrug, requiring reduction for activity. Spiruchostatin A was a potent (low nM) inhibitor of the growth of various cancer cell lines. Spiruchostatin A-induced acetylation of specific lysine residues within histones H3 and H4, and increased the expression of p21(cip1/waf1), but did not induce acetylation of alpha-tubulin. Spiruchostatin A also induced cell cycle arrest, differentiation and cell death in MCF7 breast cancer cells. Like FK228, spiruchostatin A was both an inducer and substrate of the ABCB1 drug efflux pump. Whereas spiruchostatin A and FK228-induced protracted histone acetylation, hydroxamate HDI-induced short-lived histone acetylation. Using a subset of HDI-target genes identified by microarray analysis, we demonstrated that these differences in kinetics of histone acetylation between HDI correlated with differences in the kinetics of induction or repression of specific target genes. Our results demonstrate that spiruchostatin A is a potent inhibitor of class I HDACs and anti-cancer agent. Differences in the kinetics of action of HDI may be important for the clinical application of these compounds.

Genome-wide association analysis of anti-TNF drug response in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
BACKGROUND: Treatment strategies blocking tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) have proven very successful in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, a significant subset of patients does not respond for unknown reasons. Currently, there are no means of identifying these patients before treatment. This study was aimed at identifying genetic factors predicting anti-TNF treatment outcome in patients with RA using a genome-wide association approach. METHODS: We conducted a multistage, genome-wide association study with a primary analysis of 2 557 253 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 882 patients with RA receiving anti-TNF therapy included through the Dutch Rheumatoid Arthritis Monitoring (DREAM) registry and the database of Apotheekzorg. Linear regression analysis of changes in the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints after 14 weeks of treatment was performed using an additive model. Markers with p<10(-3) were selected for replication in 1821 patients from three independent cohorts. Pathway analysis including all SNPs with p<10(-3) was performed using Ingenuity. RESULTS: 772 markers showed evidence of association with treatment outcome in the initial stage. Eight genetic loci showed improved p value in the overall meta-analysis compared with the first stage, three of which (rs1568885, rs1813443 and rs4411591) showed directional consistency over all four cohorts studied. We were unable to replicate markers previously reported to be associated with anti-TNF outcome. Network analysis indicated strong involvement of biological processes underlying inflammatory response and cell morphology. CONCLUSIONS: Using a multistage strategy, we have identified eight genetic loci associated with response to anti-TNF treatment. Further studies are required to validate these findings in additional patient collections.

The role of ortho, meta, para isomerism in measured solid state and derived sub-cooled liquid vapour pressures of substituted benzoic acids
Knudsen Effusion Mass Spectrometry (KEMS) has been used to measure solid state equilibrium vapour pressures of several multifunctional aromatic compounds; phthalic, isophthalic, terephthalic, para-anisic, ortho-amino benzoic, meta-amino benzoic, para-amino benzoic, vanillic, syringic, 1,2,4-tricarboxylic benzoic, 3,5-dihydroxy-4-methyl benzoic and 4-methyl phthalic acids and nitrocatechol. Sub-cooled liquid vapour pressures were derived using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measured thermochemical properties for the compounds measured here, as well as for other substituted benzoic acids using literature values. Unusual trends in the sub-cooled liquid vapour pressure, not represented by currently available vapour pressure estimation methods, are explained using a newly constructed Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) with a combination of resonance and steric effects. This was then tested against further measurements of ortho-dimethyl amino benzoic and meta-dimethyl amino benzoic acids.

The non-synonymous SNP, R1150W, in SCN9A is not associated with chronic widespread pain susceptibility.
ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Mutations in SCN9A, encoding the alpha subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav1.7), have caused severe pain disorders and congenital insensitivity to pain. The aim of this study was to validate the previously reported association between a common non-synonymous polymorphism (R1150W, rs6746030) in SCN9A and chronic widespread pain (CWP), in independent population-based cohorts. FINDINGS: Genotype data for rs6746030 was available in four population-based cohorts (EPIFUND, the European Male Ageing Study (EMAS), the Framingham study and the Dyne Steel DNA Bank of Ageing and Cognition). Pain was assessed using body manikins and CWP was scored using American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria in all cohorts, except the Framingham study which assessed widespread pain (WP) using ACR criteria on a joint pain homunculus. Controls were subjects who reported no pain. Logistic regression (additive genetic model) was used to test for association between rs6746030 and CWP compared to controls, adjusting for study centre in EMAS. Generalised estimating equation regression was used to test for association between rs6746030 and WP, whilst accounting for relatedness between subjects in the Framingham study.Genotype data for rs6746030 was available for 1071 CWP cases and 3212 controls. There was no significant association between CWP and rs6476030 in individual cohorts or when combined in a fixed-effects meta-analysis (Odds Ratio = 0.96 (95% confidence interval 0.82, 1.11) p = 0.567). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to a previous study, no association between a non-synonymous polymorphism in SCN9A and CWP was observed in multiple population-based cohorts.

[rubrum, cryptophyte, bay, chesapeake, abundance]

Seasonal dynamics of Mesodinium rubrum in Chesapeake Bay
The photosynthetic ciliate Mesodinium rubrum is a common member of coastal phytoplankton communities that is well adapted to low-light, turbid ecosystems. It supports the growth of or competes with harmful dinoflagellate species for cryptophyte prey, as well as being a trophic link to copepods and larval fish. We have compiled data from various sources (n = 1063), on the abundance and distribution of M. rubrum in Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Because M. rubrum relies on obtaining
organelles from cryptophyte algae to maintain rapid growth, we also enumerated cryptophyte algae in the portion of these samples that we collected (n = 386). M. rubrum occurred in oligohaline to polyhaline regions of Chesapeake Bay and throughout the year. Blooms (>100 cells ml-1) of M. rubrum primarily occurred during spring, followed by autumn. When compared across all seasons, M. rubrum abundance was positively correlated to temperature and cryptophytes, and negatively correlated with salinity. However, more focused analyses revealed that M. rubrum abundance during spring was associated with surface layer warming and decreased salinity, while early autumn assemblages were associated with surface cooling. These results imply there are distinct seasonal niches for M. rubrum blooms. Blooms of M. rubrum were more common in tributaries than in the main stem Bay and tended to be restricted to salinities under 10 PSU. Despite the rarity of “red water” events, M. rubrum is a ubiquitous mixotroph in Chesapeake Bay and at times likely exerts a strong influence on cryptophyte algal abundance and hence planktonic food web structure.Author Posting. © The Author(s), 2013.

PPARγ2 gene Pro12Ala and PPARα gene Leu162Val single nucleotide polymorphisms interact with dietary intake of fat in determination of plasma lipid concentrations.
BACKGROUND/AIMS: The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are transcriptional regulators of lipid metabolism, activated by unsaturated fatty acids. We investigated independent and interactive effects of PPARγ2 gene PPARG Pro12Ala (rs1801282) andPPARαgene PPARA Leu162Val (rs1800206) genotypes with dietary intake of fatty acids on concentrations of plasma lipids in subjects of whom 47.5% had metabolic syndrome. METHODS: The RISCK study is a parallel design, randomised controlled trial. Plasma lipids were quantified at baseline after a 4-week high saturated fatty acids diet and after three parallel 24-week interventions with reference (high saturated fatty acids), high monounsaturated fatty acids and low-fat diets. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped in 466 subjects. RESULTS: At baseline, the PPARG Ala12allele was associated with increased plasma total cholesterol (n = 378; p = 0.04), LDL cholesterol (p = 0.05) and apoB (p =0.05) after adjustment for age, gender and ethnicity. At baseline, PPARA Leu162Val × PPARG Pro12Ala genotype interaction did not significantly influence plasma lipid concentrations. After dietary intervention, gene-gene interaction significantly influenced LDL cholesterol (p =0.0002) and small dense LDL as a proportion of LDL (p = 0.005) after adjustments. CONCLUSIONS: Interaction between PPARG Pro12Ala and PPARA Leu162Val genotypes may influence plasma LDL cholesterol concentration and the proportion as small dense LDL after a high monounsaturated fatty acids diet.

Eligible evaluations had to report intra- or inter-rater reliability, accuracy, agreement, or feasibility of methods. Electronic databases and other sources were accessed for study identification. Included studies were critically appraised using a modified checklist for diagnostic test evaluations. Twelve studies were included. Most had methodological problems and/or used inappropriate statistical methods. Reliable methods for measuring pressure ulcer surface area may include: grid tracings from photographs combined with whole plus partial square count; a portable digital pad; and stereophotogrammetry combined with computerized image analysis. The agreement between photographic tracing and direct transparency tracing may be satisfactory (both methods being combined with computerized planimetry). No definitive conclusions could be reached about studies of diameter or depth; this means that there is little evidence to underpin recommendations in clinical guidelines. Evaluations of volume measurement were of poor quality, and there were few data on feasibility. Further primary research is needed to evaluate methods of wound measurement used in clinical practice.

A cryptic type I polyketide synthase (cpk) gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2)
The chromosome of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), a model organism for the genus Streptomyces, contains a cryptic type I polyketide synthase (PKS) gene cluster which was revealed when the genome was sequenced. The ca. 54-kb cluster contains three large genes, cpkA, cpkB and cpkC, encoding the PKS subunits. In silico analysis showed that the synthase consists of a loading module, five extension modules and a unique reductase as a terminal domain instead of a typical thioesterase. All acyltransferase domains are specific for a malonyl extender, and have a B-type ketoreductase. Tailoring and regulatory genes were also identified within the gene cluster. Surprisingly, some genes show high similarity to primary metabolite genes not commonly identified in any antibiotic biosynthesis cluster. Using western blot analysis with a PKS subunit (CpkC) antibody, CpkC was shown to be expressed in S. coelicolor at transition phase. Disruption of cpkC gave no obvious phenotype. ?? 2006 Springer-Verlag.

[infection, respiratory]

Respiratory infections: do we ever recover?
Although the outcome of respiratory infection alters with age, nutritional status, and immunologic competence, there is a growing body of evidence that we all develop a unique but subtle inflammatory profile. This uniqueness is determined by the sequence of infections or antigenic insults encountered that permanently mold our lungs through experience. This experience and learning process forms the basis of immunologic memory that is attributed to the acquired immune system. But what happens if the pathogen is not homologous to any preceding it? In the absence of cross-specific acquired immunity, one would expect a response similar to that of a subject who had never been infected with anything before. It is now clear that this is not the case. Prior inflammation in the respiratory tract alters immunity and pathology to subsequent infections even when they are antigenically distinct. Furthermore, the influence of the first infection is long lasting, not dependent on the presence of T and B cells, and effective against disparate pathogen combinations. We have used the term "innate imprinting" to explain this phenomenon, although innate education may be a closer description. This educational process, by sequential waves of infection, may be beneficial, as shown for successive viral infections, or significantly worse, as illustrated by the increased susceptibly to life-threatening bacterial pneumonia in patients infected with seasonal and pandemic influenza. We now examine what these long-term changes involve, the likely cell populations affected, and what this means to those studying inflammatory disorders in the lung.

Abatacept in the long-term treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
The last decade has been an era of exciting and innovative therapeutic targets in the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis. One such treatment that acts by disrupting T-cell activation is abatacept, which is currently used in patients who have had an inadequate clinical response to traditional disease-modifying drugs or anti-TNF therapies. As newer therapies emerge, issues that need addressing include: long-term drug tolerance, adverse events, sustained clinical response, prevention of progression in structural damage and retention rates. In this article we discuss a recently published paper by Kremer et al. that reported 3-year data on safety, efficacy and radiographic progression in patients enrolled in a clinical trial of abatacept, as well as the advantages and limitations of long-term extension studies.

A Comparative Study of Helicopter Engine Air Particle Separator Technologies
An investigation into the efficacy of helicopter engine sand filters is conducted. Engine Air Particle Separation devices are broadly split into three categories: Vortex Tube Separators, Integrated Particle Separators, and Inlet Barrier Filters. The first two are inertial separators that scavenge particles by centrifugal force; the latter traps particles on its surface, but all three are designed with the aim or removing all particles from the engine bound air. Each technology is different, which gives rise to varying levels of efficacy. The current work uses low order analytical and numerical models to explore these differences and introduces a metric for quantifying the quality of air-particle separation performance. The vortex tube separators exhibit a high efficiency and low pressure drop, but require auxiliary power to operate and experience considerable drag at high forward speeds. Inertial particle separators do not achieve the high separation efficiencies of the vortex tubes or barrier filters, but have a large mass flow to frontal area ratio, hence low drag. Inlet barrier filters are highly efficient at removing particles and improve in this over time due to the accumulation of particles, but at the expense of a temporally increasing pressure drop. The new metric is a quality factor that can be used to directly compare separation technologies for helicopter. Its application is demonstrated by the inlet barrier filter which, when clean, is the best performing device, but over time deteriorates in quality due to the accumulation of particles.

Bumiputera Institution and the Development of Corporate Governance in Malaysia
Realizing the limitations of economic theories in explaining corporate governance practices, this thesis adopts an institutional approach in its attempt to understand how such issues are shaped by larger institutional contexts. Malaysia is used as a case study; and accordingly the influence of a dominant institution of Bumiputera (sons of the soil) on corporate governance practices is investigated. The thesis focuses on the emergence, institutionalization impact, and change of the Bumiputera institution; and how corporate governance practices are influenced in each stage. As a lens for analysis, this thesis integrates sociological and historical paradigms of the new institutionalisms, and extends Beckert’s (2010) framework to include the role of power as advanced by Steven Lukes (1974, 2005). This extended framework is useful in explaining how the reciprocal influence of the Bumiputera institution, social networks, cognition, and power affect the behaviour of corporate governance actors. 	The analysis shows that, following the commitment by the state towards Bumiputera, the Malays’ equity ownership has seen a progressive increase, although it failed to meet the specified target of 30%. Malays’ representation on corporate boards also increased. The commitment has also led to a strong state presence in the economy, through its involvement in the Government Linked Companies, established to pursue Bumiputera’s objectives. However, unintended consequences have arisen affecting both ownership and appointment. The analysis also shows that, while board appointment is largely based on social networks, the existence of the Bumiputera institution means that ethnicity matters. Appointment could be for political or legitimacy reasons. Heightened by liberalisation moves, both Bumiputera and corporate governance institutions are subject to change. However, this refers only to the regulative aspects of the institutions, which are more susceptible to change compared to their informal elements. The state’s commitment towards Bumiputera remains. This study contributes to corporate governance literature by providing evidence on how corporate governance institutions are influenced by the larger social-political and institutional context vis-à-vis the emerging economy. This study shows that: firstly, corporate governance practices are shaped by history and political contexts; hence, understanding history would enhance the understanding of corporate governance. Secondly, ownership structure and the board of directors are not just mechanisms of corporate governance; rather, they are also channels through which larger objectives, including social objectives, are being pursued. Finally, this institution of corporate governance is not driven by functional needs of capital providers, but is shaped by powerful actors. Corporate governance practices are not intended just for resolving a particular agency problem, but are a mode of response to a particular historical incident that developed in postcolonial Malaysia.

[bag-1, function, isoform, cancer]

BAG-1 in carcinogenesis.
BAG-1 is a multifunctional protein that exists as several differentially localised and functionally distinct isoforms. BAG-1 isoforms interact with a diverse array of molecular targets and regulate a wide range of cellular processes, including proliferation, survival, transcription, apoptosis, metastasis and motility. The BAG domain of BAG-1 interacts with chaperone molecules and this is considered important for many BAG-1 functions. The ability of BAG-1 to regulate such a wide variety of cellular processes suggests it might play an important role in many cancer types. For example, regulation of nuclear hormone receptor function and susceptibility to apoptosis might have a major impact on cancer development, progression and response to therapy. There is also increasing evidence that BAG-1 expression is altered in a variety of human malignancies relative to normal cells, and with further understanding of BAG-1 function it might become a powerful prognostic/predictive marker in human cancer. This review describes the structure and function of BAG-1 isoforms and the potential clinical implications of their expression in tumour cells.

[peptide, effect, ucn, hypertrophic, akt]

Hypertrophic effects of urocortin homologous peptides are mediated via activation of the Akt pathway.
The UCN homologues SCP and SRP bind specifically to the CRFR2 receptor, whereas UCN binds to both CRFR1 and CRFR2. We have previously demonstrated that all three peptides are cardioprotective, and both the Akt and MAPK p42/44 pathways are essential for this effect. Here we tested the hypertrophic effects of these peptides. We examined the effects of the peptides on cell area, protein synthesis, and induction of the natriuretic peptides ANP and BNP. All three peptides were able to increase all the markers of hypertrophy examined, with SCP being the most potent of the three, followed by UCN and SRP last. In addition, we provide a mechanism of action for the three peptides and show that Akt phosphorylation is important for their hypertrophic action, whereas MAPK p42/44 is not involved in this effect.

Effect of the Tilt Angle on Antimony in Silicon Implanted Wafers
<p>A dose of 5.0x10(14) antimony (Sb+) ions cm(-2) was implanted into silicon wafers at an energy of 70 keV, at different tilt angles (0degrees, 15degrees, 30degrees, 45degrees, and 60degrees). One set of samples was preamorphized with 160 keV germanium (Ge+) ions with a dose of 1x10(15) cm(-2). The second set consisted of implants into single crystal silicon. After implantation the samples were annealed at 700 degreesC for 30 s in a pure nitrogen ambient. Secondary ion mass spectroscopy was performed to evaluate the atomic profile and the retained dose as a function of the tilt angle before and after annealing. Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy and ion channeling measurements were performed to quantify the retained dose and the subtitutional fraction of antimony in the preamorphized and crystalline samples. Hall measurements were performed in order to calculate the proportion of the dopant which was electrically active. It was found that the substitutional fraction was a function of the tilt angle for all of the implanted samples. A correlation was also found between the electrical activation and the subtitutional fraction with the highest electrical activation being found at 15degrees tilt (90% for antimony implants into crystalline silicon) and 0degrees tilt (94% for antimony implants into amorphous silicon). For all implant angles the substitutional fraction and dopant activation was greater for the implants into amorphized silicon than for those into the crystalline phase.</p>

Reconstructing the Three-Dimensional GABAergic Microcircuit of the Striatum
A system's wiring constrains its dynamics, yet modelling of neural structures often overlooks the specific networks formed by their neurons. We developed an approach for constructing anatomically realistic networks and reconstructed the GABAergic microcircuit formed by the medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) of the adult rat striatum. We grew dendrite and axon models for these neurons and extracted probabilities for the presence of these neurites as a function of distance from the soma. From these, we found the probabilities of intersection between the neurites of two neurons given their inter-somatic distance, and used these to construct three-dimensional striatal networks. The MSN dendrite models predicted that half of all dendritic spines are within 100µm of the soma. The constructed networks predict distributions of gap junctions between FSI dendrites, synaptic contacts between MSNs, and synaptic inputs from FSIs to MSNs that are consistent with current estimates. The models predict that to achieve this, FSIs should be at most 1% of the striatal population. They also show that the striatum is sparsely connected: FSI-MSN and MSN-MSN contacts respectively form 7% and 1.7% of all possible connections. The models predict two striking network properties: the dominant GABAergic input to a MSN arises from neurons with somas at the edge of its dendritic field; and FSIs are inter-connected on two different spatial scales: locally by gap junctions and distally by synapses. We show that both properties influence striatal dynamics: the most potent inhibition of a MSN arises from a region of striatum at the edge of its dendritic field; and the combination of local gap junction and distal synaptic networks between FSIs sets a robust input-output regime for the MSN population. Our models thus intimately link striatal micro-anatomy to its dynamics, providing a biologically grounded platform for further study.

Reduction of colonic motility by intravenous nicardipine in irritable bowel syndrome.
The effect of nicardipine, a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, on postprandial colonic motility was assessed in 10 patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Each patient was studied twice receiving intravenously either N saline or nicardipine after a 1000 calorie meal. In the control study there was a significant (p less than 0.01) postprandial increase in the contractile activity of the colon, reaching a peak at approximately 20 minutes. Intravenous nicardipine completely abolished the colonic response, with a significant reduction in the number (p less than 0.005) and amplitude (p less than 0.005) of contractions and of the motility index (p less than 0.025). These results support the need for further studies to evaluate the therapeutic role of nicardipine in the irritable bowel syndrome.

Correlation of C-reactive protein haplotypes with serum C-reactive protein level and response to anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy in UK rheumatoid arthritis patients: results from the Biologics in Rheumatoid Arthritis Genetics and Genomics Study Syndicate cohort.
ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: In many European countries, restrictions exist around the prescription of anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) treatments for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Eligibility and response to treatment is assessed using the disease activity score 28 (DAS28) algorithm, which incorporates one of two inflammatory markers, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP). Although DAS28-CRP provides a more reliable measure of disease activity, functional variants exist within the CRP gene that affect basal CRP production. Therefore, we aimed to determine the relationship between functional genetic variants at the CRP gene locus and levels of serum CRP in RA patients, and determine whether these variants, alone or in combination, are correlated with DAS28-CRP and change in DAS28-CRP following anti-TNF treatment. METHODS: DNA samples from the Biologics in Rheumatoid Arthritis Genetics and Genomics Study Syndicate (BRAGGSS) were genotyped for rs1205, rs1800947 and rs3091244 using either TaqMan(R) or the Sequenom(R) MassARRAY iPLEX system. Estimated haplotypes were constructed for each sample using the expectation maximisation algorithm implemented in the haplo.stats package within the R statistical programme. CRP values were log transformed and the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), haplotypes of SNPs and baseline CRP, baseline DAS28-CRP and change in DAS28-CRP were evaluated using linear regression in STATA v.10. RESULTS: Baseline CRP measurements were available for 599 samples with 442 also having data 6 months after treatment with an anti-TNF. For these 442 samples, the study had > 80% power to detect a clinically meaningful difference of 0.6 DAS28 Units for an allele frequency of 5%. Estimated haplotype frequencies corresponded with previous frequencies reported in the literature. Overall, no significant association was observed between any of the markers investigated and baseline CRP levels. Further, CRP haplotypes did not correlate with baseline CRP (P=0.593), baseline DAS28-CRP (P=0.540), or change in DAS28-CRP following treatment with an anti-TNF over 6 months (P=0.302). CONCLUSIONS: Although CRP genotype may influence baseline CRP levels, in patients with very active disease, no such association was found. This suggests that genetic variation at the CRP locus does not influence DAS28-CRP, which may continue to be used in determining eligibility for and response to anti-TNF treatment, without adjusting for CRP genotype.

[cell, hypoxic, abt-737, apoptosis, tumor, mcl-1, hypoxium]

Hypoxic human cancer cells are sensitized to BH-3 mimetic–induced apoptosis via downregulation of the Bcl-2 protein Mcl-1.
Solid tumors contain hypoxic regions in which cancer cells are often resistant to chemotherapy-induced apoptotic cell death. Therapeutic strategies that specifically target hypoxic cells and promote apoptosis are particularly appealing, as few normal tissues experience hypoxia. We have found that the compound ABT-737, a Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH-3) mimetic, promotes apoptotic cell death in human colorectal carcinoma and small cell lung cancer cell lines exposed to hypoxia. This hypoxic induction of apoptosis was mediated through downregulation of myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1), a Bcl-2 family protein that serves as a biomarker for ABT-737 resistance. Downregulation of Mcl-1 in hypoxia was independent of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) activity and was consistent with decreased global protein translation. In addition, ABT-737 induced apoptosis deep within tumor spheroids, consistent with an optimal hypoxic oxygen tension being necessary to promote ABT-737–induced cell death. Tumor xenografts in ABT-737–treated mice also displayed significantly more apoptotic cells within hypoxic regions relative to normoxic regions. Synergies between ABT-737 and other cytotoxic drugs were maintained in hypoxia, suggesting that this drug may be useful in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. Taken together, these findings suggest that Mcl-1–sparing BH-3 mimetics may induce apoptosis in hypoxic tumor cells that are resistant to other chemotherapeutic agents and may have a role in combinatorial chemotherapeutic regimens for treatment of solid tumors.

Fluorescence imaging of two-photon linear dichroism: cholesterol depletion disrupts molecular orientation in cell membranes.
The plasma membrane of cells is an ordered environment, giving rise to anisotropic orientation and restricted motion of molecules and proteins residing in the membrane. At the same time as being an organized matrix of defined structure, the cell membrane is heterogeneous and dynamic. Here we present a method where we use fluorescence imaging of linear dichroism to measure the orientation of molecules relative to the cell membrane. By detecting linear dichroism as well as fluorescence anisotropy, the orientation parameters are separated from dynamic properties such as rotational diffusion and homo energy transfer (energy migration). The sensitivity of the technique is enhanced by using two-photon excitation for higher photo-selection compared to single photon excitation. We show here that we can accurately image lipid organization in whole cell membranes and in delicate structures such as membrane nanotubes connecting two cells. The speed of our wide-field imaging system makes it possible to image changes in orientation and anisotropy occurring on a subsecond timescale. This is demonstrated by time-lapse studies showing that cholesterol depletion rapidly disrupts the orientation of a fluorophore located within the hydrophobic region of the cell membrane but not of a surface bound probe. This is consistent with cholesterol having an important role in stabilizing and ordering the lipid tails within the plasma membrane.

The potassium-dependent transcriptome of arabidopsis reveals a prominent role of jasmonic acid in nutrient signaling
Full genome microarrays were used to assess transcriptional responses of Arabidopsis seedlings to changing external supply of the essential macronutrient potassium (K+). Rank product statistics and iterative group analysis were employed to identify differentially regulated genes and statistically significant coregulated sets of functionally related genes. The most prominent response was found for genes linked to the phytohormone jasmonic acid (JA). Transcript levels for the JA biosynthetic enzymes lipoxygenase, allene oxide synthase, and allene oxide cyclase were strongly increased during K+ starvation and quickly decreased after K+ resupply. A large number of well-known JA responsive genes showed the same expression profile, including genes involved in storage of amino acids (VSP), glucosinolate production (CYP79), polyamine biosynthesis (ADC2), and defense (PDF1.2). Our findings highlight a novel role of JA in nutrient signaling and stress management through a variety of physiological processes such as nutrient storage, recycling, and reallocation. Other highly significant K+-responsive genes discovered in our study encoded cell wall proteins (e.g. extensins and arabinogalactans) and ion transporters (e.g. the high-affinity K+ transporter HAK5 and the nitrate transporter NRT2.1) as well as proteins with a putative role in Ca2+ signaling (e.g. calmodulins). On the basis of our results, we propose candidate genes involved in K+ perception and signaling as well as a network of molecular processes underlying plant adaptation to K + deficiency. ?? 2004 American Society of Plant Biologists.

A wide range of measurements of airborne particle physical metrics and chemical composition were made as well as measurements of a considerable range of gas phase species and the fluxes of both particulate and gas phase substances. Significant findings include (a) demonstration of the evaporation of traffic-generated nanoparticles during both horizontal and vertical atmospheric transport; (b) generation of a large base of information on the fluxes of nanoparticles, accumulation mode particles and specific chemical components of the aerosol and a range of gas phase species, as well as the elucidation of key processes and comparison with emissions inventories; (c) quantification of vertical gradients in selected aerosol and trace gas species which has demonstrated the important role of regional transport in influencing concentrations of sulphate, nitrate and secondary organic compounds within the atmosphere of London; (d) generation of new data on the atmospheric structure and turbulence above London, including the estimation of mixed layer depths; (e) provision of new data on trace gas dispersion in the urban atmosphere through the release of purposeful tracers; (f) the determination of spatial differences in aerosol particle size distributions and their interpretation in terms of sources and physico-chemical transformations; (g) studies of the nocturnal oxidation of nitrogen oxides and of the diurnal behaviour of nitrate aerosol in the urban atmosphere, and (h) new information on the chemical composition and source apportionment of particulate matter size fractions in the atmosphere of London derived both from bulk chemical analysis and aerosol mass spectrometry with two instrument types.

Clinical trials are mandatory protocols describing medical research on humans and among the most valuable sources of medical practice evidence. Searching for trials relevant to some query is laborious due to the immense number of existing protocols. Apart from search, writing new trials includes composing detailed eligibility criteria, which might be time-consuming, especially for new researchers. In this paper we present ASCOT, an efficient search application customised for clinical trials. ASCOT uses text mining and data mining methods to enrich clinical trials with metadata, that in turn serve as effective tools to narrow down search. In addition, ASCOT integrates a component for recommending eligibility criteria based on a set of selected protocols.

Loss of stromal caveolin-1 expression predicts poor clinical outcome in triple negative and basal-like breast cancers.
Here, we investigated the possible predictive value of stromal caveolin-1 (Cav-1) as a candidate biomarker for clinical outcome in triple negative (TN) breast cancer patients. A cohort of 85 TN breast cancer patients was available, with the necessary annotation and nearly 12 years of follow-up data. Our primary outcome of interest in this study was overall survival. Interestingly, TN patients with high-levels of stromal Cav-1 had a good clinical outcome, with >50% of the patients remaining alive during the follow-up period. In contrast, the median survival for TN patients with moderate stromal Cav-1 staining was 33.5 months. Similarly, the median survival for TN patients with absent stromal Cav-1 staining was 25.7 months. A comparison of 5-year survival rates yields a similar pattern. TN patients with high stromal Cav-1 had a good 5-year survival rate, with 75.5% of the patients remaining alive. In contrast, TN patients with moderate or absent stromal Cav-1 levels had progressively worse 5-year survival rates, with 40 and 9.4% of the patients remaining alive. In contrast, in a parallel analysis, the levels of tumor epithelial Cav-1 had no prognostic significance. As such, the prognostic value of Cav-1 immunostaining in TN breast cancer patients is compartment-specific, and selective for an absence of Cav-1 staining in the stromal fibroblast compartment. A recursive-partitioning algorithm was used to assess which factors are most predictive of overall survival in TN breast cancer patients. In this analysis, we included tumor size, histologic grade, whether the patient received surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, CK5/6, EGFR, p53 and Ki67 status, as well as the stromal Cav-1 score. This analysis indicated that stromal loss of Cav-1 expression was the most important prognostic factor for overall survival in TN breast cancer. Virtually identical results were obtained with CK5/6 (+) and/or EGFR (+) TN breast cancer cases, demonstrating that a loss of stromal Cav-1 is also a strong prognostic factor for basal-like breast cancers. Our current findings may have important implications for the close monitoring and treatment stratification of TN and basal-like breast cancer patients.

A major challenge in toxicology is the development of non-animal methods for the assessment of human health risks that might result from repeated systemic exposure. We present here a perspective that considers the opportunities that computational modelling methods may offer in addressing this challenge. Our approach takes the form of a commentary designed to inform responses to future calls for research in predictive toxicology. It is considered essential that computational model-building activities be at the centre of the initiative, driving an iterative process of development, testing and refinement. It is critical that the models provide mechanistic understanding and quantitative predictions. The aim would be to predict effects in humans; in order to help define a challenging but yet feasible initial goal the focus would be on liver mitochondrial toxicity. This will inevitably present many challenges that naturally lead to a modular approach, in which the overall problem is broken down into smaller, more self-contained sub-problems that will subsequently need to be connected and aligned to develop an overall understanding. The project would investigate multiple modelling approaches in order to encourage links between the various disciplines that hitherto have often operated in isolation. The project should build upon current activities in the wider scientific community, to avoid duplication of effort and to ensure that investment is maximised. Strong leadership will be required to ensure alignment around a set of common goals that would be derived using a problem-statement driven approach. Finally, although the focus here is on toxicology, there is a clear link to the wider challenges in systems medicine and improving human health.

ALTERATIONS IN HUMAN VISCERAL SENSATION INDUCED BY NON-INVASIVE CORTICAL AND LUMBOSACRAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION IN HEALTH AND DISEASE
Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID) which can be defined as chronic, relapsing visceral pain with bloating associated with change in bowel habit.  It affects up to 10-15% of the adult population in the UK and is more common in females.  The cost of IBS in terms of health care utilisation is substantial, exceeding £45.6 million per year in the UK alone, yet its pathophysiology is incompletely understood.  Visceral pain is the main and most difficult symptom to manage in IBS and many IBS female sufferers compare it to labour pain in its severity.  Modulating visceral pain in healthy volunteers and IBS patients is therefore an important research area.  Non-invasive magnetic stimulation may play a crucial role in this respect.  Aim:The aim of this study is to ascertain whether non-invasive repetitive magnetic stimulation applied to the motor cortex and/or lumbosacrum can modulate gastrointestinal pain originating from the anorectum. Methods:Participants: 16 healthy volunteers and 10 IBS patients aged 18 and above were included in the study.Questionnaires: Healthy volunteers and IBS patients were asked to complete anxiety and depression questionnaire and IBS patients were requested to fill in an IBS severity questionnaire.Motor measurements in healthy subjects: Single-pulse lumbosacral magnetic stimulation (LSMS) was applied to the lumbosacral area for the anal sphincter where the largest motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude response was detected.  Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was then performed at the pre-determined resting motor thresholds (RMT) for the anal sphincter and the hand.Sensory measurements in healthy subjects and IBS patients: Electrical stimulation was used to assess the changes in sensory and pain thresholds in the anorectal area.  The subjects were asked to score the pain intensity using five-point categorical rating scales.  In addition they were asked to describe the pain experienced using a shortened form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire.  Intervention: Healthy volunteers received 6 paradigms of magnetic stimulation in a randomised order i.e. 3 repetitive LSMSs (1 Hz, 10 Hz and sham) and 3 repetitive TMSs (1 Hz, 10 Hz and sham) to investigate their modulatory effects on visceral sensitivity and to determine which of these interventions is most effective.  The most effective active interventions (1 Hz rLSMS and 10 Hz rTMS) together with one sham were then trialled in a randomised fashion on IBS patients.Post intervention: Motor excitabilities were repeated at 30 min after each intervention.  The assessment of sensory and pain thresholds at anal sphincter and rectum were done immediately, 30 and 60 min after each intervention. Results:Application of 1 Hz rLSMS led to alterations of anal sphincter motor excitabilities and resulted in a significant increase in the amplitude of lumbosacal-anal motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in healthy volunteers recorded at 30 min post intervention.  In healthy volunteers, 1 Hz rLSMS and 10 Hz rTMS caused a significant increase in the rectal pain thresholds experienced immediately, 30 and 60 min after each intervention.  10 Hz rLSMS and 1 Hz rTMS only led to a significant rise in rectal pain thresholds immediately after their application.  Furthermore, there was a significant increase in the rectal pain thresholds immediately, 30 and 60 min following 1 Hz rLSMS and 10 Hz rTMS in IBS patients. Conclusion:The application of magnetic stimulation to the cortical and lumbosacral areas to modulate visceral pain is a new concept, which reduced rectal sensitivity to painful stimuli and offers a much needed new approach in the management of abdominal pain in patients with IBS.

Deciphering isotopic signals of monsoon-induced upwelling in foraminifera from the Western Arabian sea sediment trap
Isotopic analyses have been made on four species of foraminifera collected with a
PARFLUX Mark VI sediment trap in the Arabian Sea during the 1986 and 1987
monsoons. Two of the species are non-spinose thermocline dwellers (Neogloboquadrina
dutertrei, Globorotalia menardii) and two are spinose surface dwellers (Globigerinoides
sacculifer, Globigerina bulloides). Individual tests were measured for shape, and analyzed
for carbon and oxygen isotopes to document how each species responded to phases of the
upwelling system, and to determine the utility of these planktonic foraminifera as upwelling
indicators. The oxygen isotopic composition of the two thermocline dwellers remained
fairly constant during the seasonal monsoon cycle, showing little to no effect from
upwelling whereas the surface dwellers exhibited a wider range of δ18O values. The δ13C
signal shows a similar pattern, with the thermocline dwellers showing less variation than
the surface dwellers. Results are compared to the empirical model of Kroon and Ganssen
(1989) that describes a faunal succession of planktonic foraminiferal species based on
isotopic composition and timing of optimum growth conditions. The succession of species
based on fluxes was inconclusive and although three of the species showed the same
isotopic patterns as described in the model, G. bulloides was not enriched in δ13C, as
predicted. The covariance of δ13C and δ180 in this particular species suggests that G.
bulloides is isotopically unreliable for reconstruction of monsoon-induced upwelling in the
Arabian Sea.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution March 1997This research was made possible through funding from two sources,

[decision, therapy, glucocorticoid, dose, knowledge, process, benefit, harm, drug, patient]

Understanding the side effects of glucocorticoid therapy: shining a light on a drug everyone thinks they know.
Glucocorticoids are one of the most frequently prescribed therapies in rheumatology, a reflection of their effectiveness as a powerful anti-inflammatory drug. Glucocorticoids are also, however, associated with a wide range of adverse events, particularly at higher doses. To make appropriate decisions, doctors and patients need to weigh these benefits against the potential harms. This article describes the many uncertainties which make informed prescribing difficult. We lack knowledge, for example, on the magnitude of risk, the relationship to dose and duration, and what happens to risk on stopping therapy. Beyond safety, we describe how patients may lack understanding of the nature of the benefits and harms, and how to incorporate value judgements which are crucial to the decision making process. We conclude by exploring how future research might fill these knowledge gaps to enable a better informed decision process.

Prediction and possible observation of an oblate shape isomer in W-190
Energy-surface calculations for nuclides in the neutron-rich W-190(74)116 region show consistently that the collective rotation of a deformed oblate shape is an energetically favoured mode, especially for angular momenta 1 > 12h. By comparing the calculations with existing experimental data, it is concluded that the reported t(1/2) similar to 1 ms isomer in W-190 may be an oblate shape isomer. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

[analgesic, mild, risk, use, belief, dose]

Reasons for the use of mild analgesics among English students.
OBJECTIVE: Mild analgesics such as paracetamol and ibuprofen are amongst the most commonly used over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. However, little is known about what beliefs people hold about them. The present paper examines: (a) the patterns of mild analgesic usage in a sample of university students, (b) their beliefs about the associated risks and the necessity of taking mild analgesics, and (c) the association between beliefs about analgesics and self-reports of their use. SETTING: A convenience sample of 333 students studying at a large English University were approached on the University campus. Of these, 291 agreed to participate, yielding an 87% response rate. METHOD: This study employed a cross-sectional design, with all participants completing the same questionnaire concerning their use of mild painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, and beliefs about their use. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Four questions asked about their patterns of mild analgesic use in the past month, specifically (a) have they taken analgesics, (b) how often did they take analgesics when they had symptoms, (c) did they take more than a single dose of 1-2 tablets at one time, and (d) did they exceed the maximum dose. RESULTS: Almost all of the 291 participants reported symptoms in the past month, with over two thirds treating with mild analgesics, and one sixth exceeding the maximum dose. Only 17% indicated that there were short-term risks of using mild analgesics, although half indicated that there were long-term risks. The risks that were identified generally did not conform with current medical thinking. Perceptions of risks were not generally associated with self-reports of analgesic usage. Rather, respondents who thought analgesics were more necessary were more likely to report taking analgesics, report taking more analgesics, and report exceeding the maximum dose. CONCLUSION: These results indicate the need for caution in current moves to encourage self-medication. If people are unaware of the risks of drugs such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, then they may only contact health professionals after they experience adverse effects.

[patient, intervention, preference, lung, cancer, symptom, attribute]

Applying Best-Worst scaling methodology to establish delivery preferences of a symptom supportive care intervention in patients with lung cancer.
BACKGROUND: Delivering a non-pharmacological symptom management intervention in patients with lung cancer is often challenging due to difficulties with recruitment, high attrition rates, high symptom burden, and other methodological problems. The aim of the present study was to elicit quantitative estimates of utility (benefit) associated with different attribute levels (delivery options) of a symptom management intervention in lung cancer patients. METHODS: An application of Best-Worst scaling methodology was used. Effects (attributes) tested included the location of the intervention (home or hospital), type of trainer (health professional or trained volunteer), caregiver involvement or not, and intervention delivered individually or in groups of patients. Participants were asked to evaluate and compare their preferences (utilities) towards the different attribute levels within scenarios and select the pair of attribute levels that they consider to be furthest apart. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients with lung cancer participated. The most important preferences for an intervention included the location (being delivered at home) and delivered by a health care professional. The least important preference was the involvement of a caregiver. Gender had an effect on preferences, with females being less inclined than men to prefer to receive an intervention in the home than the hospital and less inclined than men to have no other patients present. Furthermore, older participants and those in advanced stages of their disease were less inclined to have no other patients present compared to younger participants and those with earlier stages of disease, respectively. CONCLUSION: Considering patient preferences is an important step in developing feasible, patient-centred, appropriate and methodologically rigorous interventions and this study provided indications of such patient preferences.

Clinical significance and molecular characteristics of circulating tumor cells and circulating tumor microemboli in patients with small-cell lung cancer.
PURPOSE: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) may have utility as surrogate biomarkers and "virtual" biopsies. We report the clinical significance and molecular characteristics of CTCs and CTC clusters, termed circulating tumor microemboli (CTM), detected in patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) undergoing standard treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serial blood samples from 97 patients receiving chemotherapy were analyzed using EpCam-based immunomagnetic detection and a filtration-based technique. Proliferation status (Ki67) and apoptotic morphology were examined. Associations of CTC and CTM number with clinical factors and prognosis were determined. RESULTS: CTCs were present in 85% of patients (77 of 97 patients) and were abundant (mean ± standard deviation = 1,589 ± 5,565). CTM and apoptotic CTCs were correlated with total CTC number and were detected in 32% and 57% of patients, respectively. Pretreatment CTCs, change in CTC number after one cycle of chemotherapy, CTM, and apoptotic CTCs were independent prognostic factors. Overall survival was 5.4 months for patients with ≥ 50 CTCs/7.5 mL of blood and 11.5 months (P < .0001) for patients with less than 50 CTCs/7.5 mL of blood before chemotherapy (hazard ratio = 2.45; 95% CI, 1.39 to 4.30; P = .002). Subpopulations of apoptotic and of proliferating solitary CTCs were detected, whereas neither were observed within cell clusters (CTM), implicating both protection from anoikis and relative resistance to cytotoxic drugs for cells within CTM. CONCLUSION: Both baseline CTC number and change in CTC number after one cycle of chemotherapy are independent prognostic factors for SCLC. Molecular comparison of CTCs to cells in CTM may provide novel insights into SCLC biology.

Felt and potential ambivalence across the stages of change.
This study tested discontinuity patterns across the stages of change. Fat intake, theory of planned behaviour (TPB) variables, and felt and potential ambivalence were assessed in 16-17 year olds (N = 187). Across the stages of change there were: (a) linear increases in TPB variables, (b) linear decreases in fat intake, and (c) quadratic relationships with felt and potential ambivalence. Although felt and potential ambivalence were moderately correlated, the correlation between the two was significantly higher in the action and maintenance stages. The findings are consistent with the idea that successful actors/maintainers are vigilant with respect to lapses.

[sub-unit, dendritic, function, neuron, non-separable, dendrite, sufficient]

Passive Dendrites Enable Single Neurons to Compute Linearly Non-separable Functions.
Local supra-linear summation of excitatory inputs occurring in pyramidal cell dendrites, the so-called dendritic spikes, results in independent spiking dendritic sub-units, which turn pyramidal neurons into two-layer neural networks capable of computing linearly non-separable functions, such as the exclusive OR. Other neuron classes, such as interneurons, may possess only a few independent dendritic sub-units, or only passive dendrites where input summation is purely sub-linear, and where dendritic sub-units are only saturating. To determine if such neurons can also compute linearly non-separable functions, we enumerate, for a given parameter range, the Boolean functions implementable by a binary neuron model with a linear sub-unit and either a single spiking or a saturating dendritic sub-unit. We then analytically generalize these numerical results to an arbitrary number of non-linear sub-units. First, we show that a single non-linear dendritic sub-unit, in addition to the somatic non-linearity, is sufficient to compute linearly non-separable functions. Second, we analytically prove that, with a sufficient number of saturating dendritic sub-units, a neuron can compute all functions computable with purely excitatory inputs. Third, we show that these linearly non-separable functions can be implemented with at least two strategies: one where a dendritic sub-unit is sufficient to trigger a somatic spike; another where somatic spiking requires the cooperation of multiple dendritic sub-units. We formally prove that implementing the latter architecture is possible with both types of dendritic sub-units whereas the former is only possible with spiking dendrites. Finally, we show how linearly non-separable functions can be computed by a generic two-compartment biophysical model and a realistic neuron model of the cerebellar stellate cell interneuron. Taken together our results demonstrate that passive dendrites are sufficient to enable neurons to compute linearly non-separable functions.

Atrial fibrillation is under-recognized in chronic heart failure: insights from a heart failure cohort treated with cardiac resynchronization therapy.
AIMS: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Under-detection of asymptomatic paroxysmal AF (PAF) underestimates the true burden of AF in patients with CHF. We retrospectively studied the prevalence of asymptomatic PAF in 162 CHF patients through analysis of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device downloads to determine whether these episodes are associated with adverse outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: An episode of AF was defined by mode switching on CRT devices with an atrial rate >200 for at least 30 s. Of the 101 patients thought to be persistently in sinus rhythm (SR), 27% were found to have significant paroxysms of AF, with the cumulative percentage of time in the 'mode-switch mode' (i.e. the AF burden) of 1.6 +/- 0.9%. Mortality was 19.2% in patients with newly identified PAF with hospitalization and thrombo-embolism rates of 42.3 and 2.1%, respectively, compared with mortality of 10.4% with hospitalization and thrombo-embolism rates of 41.8 and 1.9%, respectively, in patients persistently in SR (P= NS). CONCLUSION: Analysis of data from CRT devices in a population of CHF patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction shows that a significant proportion of those perceived to be persistently in SR have undiagnosed paroxysms of AF but with relatively low burden. These episodes appear to be associated with a trend towards increased mortality but no effects on hospitalization or thrombo-embolism rates.

SADIe: Structural-Semantics for Accessibility and Device Independence
Currently the World Wide Web is visual-centric with web sites often being designed only with the presentation of data in mind. A consequence of this design perspective is that information contained within the data is only accessible implicitly through the layout of the web page, rather than explicitly through the data itself. While this implicit knowledge is relatively easy to access for sighted users, it is often difficult to access for visually impaired computer users. This project describes an investigation into a way of allowing visually impaired computer users the same access to information on the World Wide Web as sighted computer users. By using ontologies to capture the semantics of the CSS Stylesheets and XHTML, the implicit information contained within a web page can be reordered and manipulated into an explicit form that better suits the needs of visually impaired users. @unpublished{hcwlab57,           month = {September},           title = {SADIe: Structural-Semantics for Accessibility and Device Independence},          school = {The University of Manchester},          author = {Darren Lunn},            year = {2005},            note = {SADIe Technical Report 1},        keywords = {Transcoding, Semantic Transcoding, Cascading Style Sheets, Accessibility, Semantics, XHTML, Ontologies},             url = {http://wel-eprints.cs.manchester.ac.uk/57/},       }

[screening, ovarian, withdrawal, cancer, familial, woman, psychological, surgery, phase, study]

Withdrawal from familial ovarian cancer screening for surgery: findings from a psychological evaluation study (PsyFOCS).
OBJECTIVE: A prospective psychological evaluation study of familial ovarian cancer screening (PsyFOCS) is underway in partnership with the UK Familial Ovarian Cancer Screening Study (UK FOCSS Phase 2). One of the aims of PsyFOCS is to examine factors associated with withdrawal from the UK FOCSS prior to the onset of 4-monthly screening. METHOD: 1999 of 3224 women completed a baseline questionnaire. 110 (5.5%) women withdrew from screening prior to their first routine Phase 2 screen, of which 73 (66.4% of withdrawals) had withdrawn because they had undergone removal of their ovaries and fallopian tubes (withdrawn group). The comparison group consisted of 1868 women who remained on screening. The baseline questionnaire included measures of cancer-specific distress, anxiety, depression and illness perceptions. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis indicated that having had prior annual (Phase 1) screening (OR=13.34, p<.01), past experience of further tests (OR=2.37, p<.01) and greater cancer-specific distress (OR=1.38, p<.01) were associated with withdrawal for surgery. Belief in ageing as a cause of ovarian cancer was also associated with withdrawal (OR=1.32, p=.05). CONCLUSION: These cross-sectional data suggest that withdrawal from familial ovarian cancer screening may be influenced by both clinical and psychological factors. These may reflect women's experience of the drawbacks of screening and increased concern about ovarian cancer risk, as well as having opportunities to consider surgery as an alternative risk management strategy whilst using screening as an interim measure.

[chemokine, immunopathology, rsv, expression, mouse, infection, th2, cell, production]

Differential chemokine expression following respiratory virus infection reflects Th1- or Th2-biased immunopathology.
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major viral pathogen of infants that also reinfects adults. During RSV infection, inflammatory host cell recruitment to the lung plays a central role in determining disease outcome. Chemokines mediate cell recruitment to sites of inflammation and are influenced by, and influence, the production of cytokines. We therefore compared chemokine production in a mouse model of immunopathogenic RSV infection in which either Th1 or Th2 immunopathology is induced by prior sensitization to individual RSV proteins. Chemokine expression profiles were profoundly affected by the nature of the pulmonary immunopathology: "Th2" immunopathology in BALB/c mice was associated with increased and prolonged expression of CCL2 (MCP-1), CXCL10 (IP-10), and CCL11 (eotaxin) starting within 24 h of challenge. C57BL/6 mice with "Th2" pathology (enabled by a deficiency of CD8+ cells) also showed increased CCL2 production. No differences in chemokine receptor expression were detected. Chemokine blockers may therefore be of use for children with bronchiolitis.

Regulation of cell differentiation in C2C12 myoblasts by the Id3 helix-loop-helix protein.
To investigate the biological functions of the helix-loop-helix Id3 protein, we have examined the effects of ectopic modulation of Id3 expression on in vitro induced differentiation of mouse C2C12 myoblast cells. Transient and stable C2C12 transfectants expressing either inducible or constitutive levels of exogenous Id3 were impaired in their ability to differentiate in response to removal of mitogenic serum growth factors. Stable Id3 transfectants displayed an enhanced proliferative capacity associated with a delay in exit from the cell cycle in response to differentiation induction. Antisense blockade of Id3 potentiated differentiation and exit from S phase of the cell cycle. These observations suggest that Id3 functions as a negative regulator of differentiation by integrating mitogenic growth factor signaling into the gene regulatory program maintaining cell cycle progression.

Generalized and specific cognitive performance in clinical high-risk cohorts: a review highlighting potential vulnerability markers for psychosis
Cognitive deficits are a core feature of established psychotic illnesses. However, the association between cognition and emerging psychosis is less understood. While there is some evidence that cognitive deficits are present prior to the onset of psychosis, findings are not consistent. In this article we provide an overview of the more general cognitive findings available from genetic high-risk studies, retrospective studies, and birth cohort studies. We then focus the review on neuropsychological performance in clinically "at-risk" groups. Overall, general cognitive ability as assessed by established batteries appears to remain relatively intact in these ultra-high risk cohorts and is a poor predictor close to illness onset relative to other vulnerability factors. Further decline may occur with illness progression, more consistent with state relative to trait factors. In addition, most established cognitive tasks involve several relatively discrete cognitive subprocesses, where findings from general batteries of subtests may mask specific deficits. In this context, our review suggests that relatively specific olfactory identification and spatial working memory deficits exist prior to illness onset and may be more potent trait markers for psychosis than cognitively dense tasks such as verbal memory. Suggestions for further research address the importance of standardization of inclusion criteria and the maintenance of basic neuropsychological assessment to allow better comparison of findings across centers. Further, in order to better understand the aetiopathology of cognitive dysfunction in psychosis, more experimental, hypothesis-driven measures of discrete cognitive processes are required. Delineation of the relationship between specific cognitive ability and symptoms from data-driven approaches may improve our understanding of the role of cognition during psychosis onset.

Steady-state and equilibrium vortex configurations, transitions, and evolution in a mesoscopic superconducting cylinder
A numerical scheme to study the mixed states in a mesoscopic type-II superconducting cylinder is described. Steady-state configurations and transient behavior of the magnetic vortices for various values of the applied magnetic field H are presented. Transitions between different multivortex states as H is changed is demonstrated by contour plots and jumps in the B vs H plot. We evolve a uniformly superconducting initial state using the simplest set of relaxation equations. The results reveal that the system passes through nearly metastable intermediate configurations while seeking the final minimum-energy steady state consistent with the square symmetry of the sample. An efficient scheme to determine the equilibrium vortex configuration in a mesoscopic system at any given applied field, not limited to the symmetry of the system, is devised and demonstrated.

Identification of novel keloid biomarkers through Profiling of Tissue Biopsies versus Cell Cultures in Keloid Margin specimens Compared to adjacent Normal Skin.
Objective: Keloid disease (KD) is a benign fibroproliferative skin tumor that results from abnormal wound healing and has no single definitive treatment. This study aims to identify KD biomarkers, which are cellular mediators that can serve as indicators of normal, pathological, and therapeutic processes. Methods: Bioinformatics analytic approaches, including comprehensive literature searches and DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 2008, were performed on the established KD linkage and previously reported microarray data to identify potential candidate genes for the study. Keloid margins and unaffected skin were obtained from KD patients (n = 4). RNA was extracted from the biopsies and second-passage culture equivalents. Reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reactions were used to determine the gene expression levels. Student t tests were used to analyze the statistical significance in differential gene expressions. Results: Nineteen candidate genes were initially selected by bioinformatics analysis. Of the 19 genes, 10 were significantly (P < .05) upregulated in keloid margin biopsy specimens. The top-5 fold changes range from 10-fold to 175-fold, including aggrecan; asporin; inhibin, beta A; tumor necrosis factor-alpha inducible protein 6; and chromosome 5 open reading frame 13. There was no significant differential gene expression between the fibroblasts established using keloid margin or internal control sites. Conclusions: The transcriptomic data generated from cultures did not consistently correlate to the biopsy equivalents. This study has demonstrated 10 genes that are significantly upregulated in biopsy samples of keloid margin, 5 of which have a fold change higher than 10-fold. Importantly these genes may serve as a potential biomarker for KD.

Role of metal-reducing bacteria in arsenic release from Bengal delta sediments.
The contamination of ground waters, abstracted for drinking and irrigation, by sediment-derived arsenic threatens the health of tens of millions of people worldwide, most notably in Bangladesh and West Bengal. Despite the calamitous effects on human health arising from the extensive use of arsenic-enriched groundwaters in these regions, the mechanisms of arsenic release from sediments remain poorly characterized and are topics of intense international debate.

Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Elongated Molecules
The existence of a thermotropic biaxial nematic liquid crystal phase has been a topic of great interest for almost half a century. Of the various mesogenic shapes suggested as being able to form this phase, theory has suggested that the V-shaped or "bent-core" molecule is one of the most promising candidates. In this thesis we use a simple mesogenic model of a bent-core molecule, constructed from a number of repulsive Weeks-Chandler-Andersen potentials that are assembled into a rigid V shape. Using this model we explore the spontaneous phase behaviour that occurs in a wide array of different systems of mesogens, using molecular dynamics simulations and isotropic initial conditions. We study the relationship between molecular bend angle and phase behavior for molecules constructed from 11 potentials. We find that the phase behaviour splits into two regions, above and below a critical bend angle. Molecules wider than this angle exhibit isotropic, uniaxial nematic and smectic A phases. Narrower molecules show no uniaxially aligned phases, and instead have a clustered phase with short-range ordering and no global alignment director. Increasing system size improves the smectic layering in the wider molecules, but does not affect the global alignment of the narrower molecules. Our model is extended to include the effect of the arm length of the molecule by changing the number of potentials from which the mesogens are constructed. As the molecule is reduced in size, the critical bend angle is seen to move slowly towards more linear molecules, reducing the size of the parameter space in which uniaxial nematic alignment is possible. At 5 beads, all mesophases are seen to disappear and systems remain isotropic. We also study the behaviour of binary mixtures of bent-core molecules, both of differing arm lengths and of differing bend angles. For arm length mixtures, molecules are seen to remain mixed in the isotropic and nematic phases, and phase separate on transition to a smectic phase. In addition, uniaxial nematic phases are induced in systems that have no nematic phase of their own in isolation. For mixtures of different bend angles, systems remain fully mixed in the smectic phases for differences of up to 10 degrees, and beyond this the two components begin to separate at the nematic–smectic transition.

ESCMID* guideline for the diagnosis and management of Candida diseases 2012: diagnostic procedures.
As the mortality associated with invasive Candida infections remains high, it is important to make optimal use of available diagnostic tools to initiate antifungal therapy as early as possible and to select the most appropriate antifungal drug. A panel of experts of the European Fungal Infection Study Group (EFISG) of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) undertook a data review and compiled guidelines for the clinical utility and accuracy of different diagnostic tests and procedures for detection of Candida infections. Recommendations about the microbiological investigation and detection of candidaemia, invasive candidiasis, chronic disseminated candidiasis, and oropharyngeal, oesophageal, and vaginal candidiasis were included. In addition, remarks about antifungal susceptibility testing and therapeutic drug monitoring were made.

Nilotinib and MEK inhibitors induce synthetic lethality through paradoxical activation of RAF in drug-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia.
We show that imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib possess weak off-target activity against RAF and, therefore, drive paradoxical activation of BRAF and CRAF in a RAS-dependent manner. Critically, because RAS is activated by BCR-ABL, in drug-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, RAS activity persists in the presence of these drugs, driving paradoxical activation of BRAF, CRAF, MEK, and ERK, and leading to an unexpected dependency on the pathway. Consequently, nilotinib synergizes with MEK inhibitors to kill drug-resistant CML cells and block tumor growth in mice. Thus, we show that imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib drive paradoxical RAF/MEK/ERK pathway activation and have uncovered a synthetic lethal interaction that can be used to kill drug-resistant CML cells in vitro and in vivo.

[flexibility, system, index]

Exploring the use of flexibility indices in low carbon power systems
The term ‘flexibility’ describes the system’s ability to cope with variations and uncertainties in both generation and demand side and maintain the system reliability with minimum cost. This work presents two different ways of establishing flexibility metrics so that the flexibility of individual units as well as the whole system can be quantified offline without using complex multi-temporal simulations. The first metric is named Normalized Flexibility Index’ (NFI). It is obtained by analyzing the adjustable space of generators and the flexibility level is expressed as a normalized positive number less than unity. The second index, named Loss of Wind Estimation (LOWE), assesses the flexibility level of a system by its capability for accommodating wind. It measures the probability that wind curtailment occurs during a year. The performance and potential applications of the two indices are discussed in the paper. The results indicate these indices provide a convenient way to get a quick, consistent overview of how flexibility different systems are.

Re-sounding Radicalism: Echo in William Blake and the Chartist Poets Ernest Jones and Gerald Massey
This thesis argues that William Blake’s poetry creates meaning through internal poetic echoes, and that these Blakean echoes re-sound in Ernest Jones and Gerald Massey’s Poetry. There is no demonstrable link between Blake and Chartism; this raises the question of how to account for poetic echoes that occur in the absence of a direct link. The thesis uses two complementary methodological strategies. The significance of the Blakean echoes in Jones and Massey’s work will be demonstrated through extensive close textual analysis. This is accompanied by the historically focused argument that the Blakean echoes in Chartist poetry can be explained by a shared underlying cultural matrix of radical politics and radical Christianity. Chapter 1 opens by presenting the evidence against a demonstrable link between Blake and the Chartists. It outlines how the lack of a direct link impacts upon our understanding of the Blakean echoes in Chartist poetry. Existing theories of influence insufficiently describe these textual effects; this chapter draws upon aspects of Intertextuality and New Historicist theory to propose that Blake, Jones and Massey’s poetry is best considered in terms of echo, re-sounding and correspondence. Chapter 2 addresses the question of how Blakean echoes can occur in the absence of a direct link. Using recent Blake scholarship as a methodological model, this chapter outlines the ‘cultural matrix’ theory, suggesting that Blake and the Chartists engaged with many of the same radical historical ‘threads’. Chapter 3 explores key examples of Shelleyan influence in Jones and Massey’s poetry. This chapter highlights the direct intertextual link between Shelley and the Chartists and demonstrates how Chartist poetry might be discussed in terms of influence and allusion. Chapter 4 outlines the most notable Blakean echoes in the poetry of Jones. Jones’ poetry resonates with images of Priestcraft and Kingcraft, as well as chains and binding; similar images play a central role in Blake’s Songs of Innocence and Experience. The chapter contains significant engagement with Blake studies; it presents Blake’s imagery as echoingly interconnected both within and across poems and collections. Chapter 5 extends this close textual exploration to the work of Massey. Massey’s poetry contains many of the key Blakean images identified in the work of Jones. However, ‘The Three Voices’ contains an uncanny resonance of Blake; echo occurs as mis-hearing and trace. ‘Echo’ is not being used as a simple substitute for ‘allusion’, ‘influence’ or ‘intertext’, but here denotes an entirely different textual effect that must be judged in new terms. The conclusion summarises the thesis and asks whether the radical nature of Blake, Jones and Massey’s shared culture may have affected not only their vocabulary of imagery, but also the way in which these images were deployed.

Collaborative Interventions for Circulation and Depression (COINCIDE): study protocol for a cluster randomized controlled trial of collaborative care for depression in people with diabetes and/or coronary heart disease.
ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Depression is up to two to three times as common in people with long-term conditions. It negatively affects medical management of disease and self-care behaviors, and leads to poorer quality of life and high costs in primary care. Screening and treatment of depression is increasingly prioritized, but despite initiatives to improve access and quality of care, depression remains under-detected and under-treated, especially in people with long-term conditions. Collaborative care is known to positively affect the process and outcome of care for people with depression and long-term conditions, but its effectiveness outside the USA is still relatively unknown. Furthermore, collaborative care has yet to be tested in settings that resemble more naturalistic settings that include patient choice and the usual care providers. The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of a collaborative-care intervention, for people with depression and diabetes/coronary heart disease in National Health Service (NHS) primary care, in which low-intensity psychological treatment services are delivered by the usual care provider - Increasing Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services.s. The study also aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention over 6 months of collaborative care, and to assess qualitatively the extent to which collaborative care was implemented in the intervention general practices. METHODS: This is a cluster randomized controlled trial of 30 general practices allocated to either collaborative care or usual care. Fifteen patients per practice will be recruited after a screening exercise to detect patients with recognized depression (greater than or equal to 10 on the nine-symptom Patient Health Questionnaire; PHQ-9). Patients in the collaborative-care arm with recognized depression will be offered a choice of evidence-based low-intensity psychological treatments based on cognitive and behavioral approaches. Patients will be case managed by psychological well-being practitioners employed by IAPT in partnership with a practice nurse and/or general practitioner. The primary outcome will be change in depressive symptoms at 6 months on the 90-item Symptoms Checklist (SCL-90). Secondary outcomes include change in health status, self-care behaviors, and self-efficacy. A qualitative process evaluation will be undertaken with patients and health practitioners to gauge the extent to which the collaborative-care model is implemented, and to explore sustainability beyond the clinical trial. DISCUSSION: COINCIDE will assess whether collaborative care can improve patient-centered outcomes, and evaluate access to and quality of care of co-morbid depression of varying intensity in people with diabetes/coronary heart disease. Additionally, by working with usual care providers such as IAPT, and by identifying and evaluating interventions that are effective and appropriate for routine use in the NHS, the COINCIDE trial offers opportunities to address translational gaps between research and implementation.Trial Registration NumberISRCTN80309252Trial StatusOpen.

Small bowel phytobezoar mimicking presentation of Crohn's disease.
A case of small bowel phytobezoar formed from unusual ingested vegetation is described. The patient presented with recurrent subacute obstruction and a right iliac fossa mass mimicking the presentation of Crohn's disease. None of the usual gastrointestinal disorders that predispose to bezoar formation were present. The phytobezoar passed spontaneously following small bowel enema and colonoscopy. It is possible that relaxation of the gut secondary to the antispasmodics administered at investigation or the physical disturbance during these procedures enabled migration through the ileocecal valve. Antispasmodics may be of use in the conservative management of bezoars obstructing otherwise normal bowel.

The use of nurses' and carers' observations in the identification of poststroke depression.
AIM: This paper is a report of a study to determine the accuracy and utility of an observational screening tool (Signs of Depression Scale), when rated by nurses and carers for detecting depression in patients who have recently had a stroke. BACKGROUND: Depression following a stroke is common and adversely affects recovery and rehabilitation. Identifying depression when patients have communication and cognitive difficulties is especially problematic. Screening tools which rely solely on observation may be beneficial in this group. METHOD: A cross-sectional study of people admitted with an acute stroke compared a clinical diagnosis of depression by a psychiatrist (the gold standard) with the Signs of Depression Scale completed by nurses and carers. The agreement between nurses' and carers' ratings was also explored. Data were collected over 10 months (December 2004-October 2005). FINDINGS: Seventy-one patients were included in the study, median age 70 inter-quartile ranges (IQR) 59-76, including 40 (56.3%) males. The psychiatrist classified 25/71 (35.2%) patients as depressed. Using the recommended cut-point of 2 or more on the Signs of Depression Scale, the nurse and carer respectively rated 27/71 (38.0%) and 18/30 (60.0%) patients as potentially depressed. The proportion of patients correctly identified as depressed by the test (sensitivity) when rated by nurses was 64%, and the proportion of patients not depressed who were correctly identified by the test (specificity) was 61%, whereas carers achieved sensitivity 90% and specificity 35%. The optimal cut-point for carers was higher at 4 or more. Inter-rater agreement on the Signs of Depression Scale between nurses and carers was fair (ICC = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.09-0.68). CONCLUSION: The Signs of Depression Scale is easily completed by clinical staff, although we found the sensitivity when completed by nurses to be low. Information from carers shows potential to improve screening and it is important for nurses to value the knowledge and skills of carers in detecting depression following a stroke. Further refinement of the Signs of Depression Scale, with accompanying research, is required.

Symptoms and problems with functioning among women and men with inoperable lung cancer—a longitudinal study
The aim of this study is to compare the prevalence and intensity of symptoms and problems with functioning between women and men with inoperable lung cancer (LC) during 3 months post-diagnosis. One hundred and fifty-nine patients completed the EORTC QLQ C-30+LC13 at three time points: close to diagnosis and prior to treatment, and one, and 3 months later. Descriptive cross-sectional analyses and longitudinal analyses using repeated measure ANOVA were conducted. These patients reported many and intense symptoms and problems with functioning. The most salient finding from the cross-sectional analysis was that women reported both more, and more intense problems with emotional functioning close to diagnosis. Statistically significant improvements over time were found in both men and women with regard to emotional functioning, dyspnea, insomnia, cough, pain in arm/shoulder, while physical functioning, fatigue, constipation, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy and alopecia deteriorated significantly over time. The longitudinal analyses suggest that, with the exception of emotional functioning, gender differences were not only related to biological sex alone, but were also found to be related to other components of the patients’ life situation, such as education, age, civil status and type of LC. Sensitivity to different symptom experiences and responses to those experiences between and within women and men is also necessary in the management of symptoms in patients with inoperable LC.

This gives an estimated prevalence of gout of around 2.5% in our adult CF population, compared to a previously described prevalence in the non-CF population of just over 1%. Serum urate is measured routinely at the annual review in our unit. Mean (SD) serum urate was 0.40 (0.09) mmol/L in male CF patients (n = 108) and 0.31 (0.08) mmol/L in female patients (n = 74). This was significantly greater than in historical controls. Thirty-seven percent of male CF patients and 36% of female patients had serum urate levels above the upper limit of normal.

Modelling human balance using switched systems with linear feedback control
We are interested in understanding the mechanisms behind and the character of the sway motion of healthy human subjects during quiet standing. We assume that a human body can be modelled as a single-link inverted pendulum, and the balance is achieved using linear feedback control. Using these assumptions, we derive a switched model which we then investigate. Stable periodic motions (limit cycles) about an upright position are found. The existence of these limit cycles is studied as a function of system parameters. The exploration of the parameter space leads to the detection of multi-stability and homoclinic bifurcations.

High field dynamic nuclear polarization—the renaissance
Sensitivity is a critical issue in NMR spectroscopy, microscopy and imaging, and the factor that often limits the success of various applications. The origin of low sensitivity in NMR is well known to be due to the small magnetic moment of nuclear spins, which yields small Boltzmann polarizations and weak absorption signals. Historically, each advance in technology and methodology that has increased the signal-to-noise in NMR has shifted the boundary of what is achievable, often opening new areas of application and directions of research. The archetypal example of this phenomenon was the introduction of Fourier transform spectroscopy which led to increases of ~10superscript 2-fold in signal-to-noise, revolutionizing NMR and many other forms of spectroscopy. More recent technological developments of note include the continuing development of higher field superconducting magnets which increases polarization, and cryoprobes in which the excitation/detection coil is maintained at low temperatures increasing sensitivity through a higher probe Q and decreasing receiver noise. In addition, innovations in NMR methodology have improved sensitivity, classic examples being Hartmann–Hahn cross polarization, and J-coupling meditated transfer methods, and the introduction of 1H detection of superscript 13C/superscript 15N resonances. Furthermore, techniques for non-inductive detection of resonance, such as the AFM-based technique of magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM), have recently allowed observation of a single electron spin, and ~100 nuclear spins/√Hzsuperscript 8.

Pyruvate kinase expression (PKM1 and PKM2) in cancer-associated fibroblasts drives stromal nutrient production and tumor growth.
We have previously demonstrated that enhanced aerobic glycolysis and/or autophagy in the tumor stroma supports epithelial cancer cell growth and aggressive behavior, via the secretion of high-energy metabolites. These nutrients include lactate and ketones, as well as chemical building blocks, such as amino acids (glutamine) and nucleotides. Lactate and ketones serve as fuel for cancer cell oxidative metabolism, and building blocks sustain the anabolic needs of rapidly proliferating cancer cells. We have termed these novel concepts the "Reverse Warburg Effect," and the "Autophagic Tumor Stroma Model of Cancer Metabolism." We have also identified a loss of stromal caveolin-1 (Cav-1) as a marker of stromal glycolysis and autophagy. The aim of the current study was to provide genetic evidence that enhanced glycolysis in stromal cells favors tumorigenesis. To this end, normal human fibroblasts were genetically-engineered to express the two isoforms of pyruvate kinase M (PKM1 and PKM2), a key enzyme in the glycolytic pathway. In a xenograft model, fibroblasts expressing PKM1 or PKM2 greatly promoted the growth of co-injected MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, without an increase in tumor angiogenesis. Interestingly, PKM1 and PKM2 promoted tumorigenesis by different mechanism(s). Expression of PKM1 enhanced the glycolytic power of stromal cells, with increased output of lactate. Analysis of tumor xenografts demonstrated that PKM1 fibroblasts greatly induced tumor inflammation, as judged by CD45 staining. In contrast, PKM2 did not lead to lactate accumulation, but triggered a "pseudo-starvation" response in stromal cells, with induction of an NFκB-dependent autophagic program, and increased output of the ketone body 3-hydroxy-buryrate. Strikingly, in situ evaluation of Complex IV activity in the tumor xenografts demonstrated that stromal PKM2 expression drives mitochondrial respiration specifically in tumor cells. Finally, immuno-histochemistry analysis of human breast cancer samples lacking stromal Cav-1 revealed PKM1 and PKM2 expression in the tumor stroma. Thus, our data indicate that a subset of human breast cancer patients with a loss of stromal Cav-1 show profound metabolic changes in the tumor microenvironment. As such, this subgroup of patients may benefit therapeutically from potent inhibitors targeting glycolysis, autophagy and/or mitochondrial activity (such as metformin).

Maximizing AUV slow speed performance
A review of the Odyssey IIB autonomous underwater vehicle shows that energy costs associated
with vehicle controls can be reduced and operational flexibility improved with relatively
simple, low cost improvements. Because the operating speed that minimizes
forward drag is not necessarily the same as that required for optimum sensor performance,
a variable speed capability extending to the bottom of the vehicle speed range is sought.
Optimizing Odyssey IIB AUV performance for slower speed operations and extended
duration missions necessitates a multi-disciplinary review including control system
design, hydrodynamic performance and sensor selection and utilization. Reducing the
vehicle controls-fixed directional instability by adding vertical fixed fins, implementing an
actuation filter, and designing a model based adaptive sliding controller improves the variable
speed performance and reduces the control actuation necessary to provide the desired
performance level with energy savings.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution September 199

Measuring beliefs about orthodontic treatment: a questionnaire approach.
OBJECTIVES: Few studies have examined what parents and orthodontists expect from and value about orthodontic treatment. In this study, we designed and tested a questionnaire to outline what drives consumer demand for children's orthodontic care. Further, we present data from the questionnaire to illustrate how expectations and values pertaining to orthodontic treatment relate to sociodemographic variables. METHODS: Subjects were 220 Pennsylvania orthodontists and 220 parents at a university orthodontic clinic who were administered a questionnaire designed to assess what parents and orthodontists value about and expect from orthodontic treatment. Items for the questionnaire were developed via a qualitative, telephone interview process. Data were analyzed using factor analysis and reliability analysis for scale development, and analysis of variance for preliminary validity assessment. RESULTS: Through factor analysis, the questionnaire was reduced from 84 to 52 items, and eight scales were examined: expected treatment benefits, expected treatment risks (short- and long-term), expected treatment inconveniences, value of treatment benefits, value of risks (short- and long-term), and value of treatment inconveniences. For parents, the reliability for all scales was in the acceptable range. For orthodontists, only the "short-term risks" scale failed to attain an acceptable reliability. Preliminary validity was assessed through examining relationships between demographic variables and subscale scores. For parents, income, father's education level, and sex of respondent were related to treatment expectations and values. For orthodontists, age, sex, and patient volume were related to treatment values. CONCLUSIONS: The questionnaire developed in the present study was found to be practical and reliable for use with providers and consumers of orthodontic care and can be used to explore factors affecting the demand for orthodontic care. Implications of possible unrealistic treatment expectations on the part of orthodontists and parents also are discussed.

Doing Belonging: a sociological study of belonging in place as the outcome of social practices
Place is disguised, hidden or simply ignored in much sociological research. Belonging, however, has become a focus of sociological concern. This thesis proposes that one way of belonging is through belonging-in-place leading to a sociological positioning of place as an active participant in social life. In much sociological research places have been seen as fixed and essentialised. To avoid this problem, this study turned to geography and anthropology for suitable frameworks incorporating an open, fluid and relational understanding of place. In particular, Ingold’s (2000) concept of the ‘taskscape’ has been used to understand the connections between place, people, activity and time. The thesis argues that ‘imagined’ and narrativised places create only an ‘outer layer’ of belonging and that it is through embodied connections to other people in the place (what I call a ‘peoplescape’) and through inalienable connections to material places over time that a three dimensional ‘ontological belonging’, as a way of being (and doing) in the world, can develop. Belonging, often spoken of as a sense or feeling, is here shown to be the outcome of social practices, by embodied beings, in a material place.The research took a phenomenological approach in order to see the life-world of the participants from within. A multi-dimensional belonging was uncovered through various user driven qualitative methods: biographical interviews and photo and written diaries with families who have lived in one place, Wigan, for at least three generations. The diaries detailed social encounters which revealed that knowing other people and being known are crucial to an embodied belonging-in-place. Taking photos alongside the diaries enabled specific places of importance to the respondents to be discussed and these revealed that places can be passed on, as inalienable gifts, from one generation, or one life phase, to the next. Inalienable traces of previous generations of Wiganers are present in the material place. The phenomenological methodology and the mix of qualitative methods enabled an inductive analysis which disclosed the everyday life-world of these people in this place. Diaries, both written and photographic, together with other respondent directed methods could be used more widely to explore seemingly mundane aspects of social life from the perspective of the participants. The research found that place is not merely a backdrop to social life but is an integral part of the social practices carried out by embodied and emplaced people. A greater emphasis on both place and materiality as they impact social life could enhance much sociological research.

The accurate detection and quantification of human diabetic peripheral neuropathy are important to define at-risk patients, anticipate deterioration and assess new therapies. Two emerging ophthalmic techniques, namely, corneal confocal microscopy and corneal aesthesiometry, demonstrate the ability to diagnose, quantify severity and assess therapeutic benefit in diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Corneal confocal microscopy allows quantification of corneal nerve morphology and non-contact corneal aesthesiometry assesses corneal sensitivity. The present review provides a detailed critique of the rationale, practical application in terms of the instruments used to capture images and the basis on which images are interpreted and analysed. We also critically evaluate how these two new non-invasive ophthalmic tests can be deployed to diagnose diabetic and other peripheral neuropathies.

Determination of cDNA, gene structure and chromosomal localization of the novel human 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 7
We have identified human 17??-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 7 {(17??-HSD} 7). The novel human {cDNA} encodes a 37 {kDa} protein that shows 78 and 74\% amino acid identity with rat and mouse {17??-HSD} 7, respectively. These enzymes are responsible for estradiol production in the corpus luteum during pregnancy, but are also present in placenta and several steroid target tissues (breast, testis and prostate) as revealed by {RT-PCR.} The human {17??-HSD} 7 gene {(HSD17B7)} consists of nine exons and eight introns, spanning 21.8 kb and maps to chromosome 10p11.2 close to susceptibility loci for tumor progression, obesity and diabetes. The {HSD17B7} promoter (1.2 kb) reveals binding sites for brain-specific and lymphoid transcription factors corresponding to additional expression domains in hematopoietic tissues and the developing brain as identified by in silico Northern blot.

A modular version of Klyachko's theorem on Lie representations of the general linear group
Klyachko, in 1974, considered the tensor and Lie powers of the natural module for the general linear group over a field of characteristic 0 and showed that nearly all of the irreducible submodules of the $r$th tensor power also occur up to isomorphism as submodules of the $r$th Lie power. Here we prove an analogue for infinite fields of prime characteristic by showing, with some restrictions on $r$, that nearly all of the indecomposable direct summands of the $r$th tensor power also occur up to isomorphism as summands of the $r$th Lie power.

Towards a mechanistic understanding of corrosion mechanisms in zirconium alloys
Understanding the key corrosion mechanisms in a light water reactor primary water environment is critical to developing and exploiting improved zirconium alloy fuel cladding. In this paper, we report recent research highlights from a new collaborative research programme involving 3 U.K. universities and 5 partners from the nuclear industry. A major part of our strategy is to use the most advanced analytical tools to characterise the oxide and metal/oxide interface microstructure, residual stresses, as well as the transport properties of the oxide. These techniques include three-dimensional atom probe (3DAP), advanced transmission electron microscopy (TEM), synchrotron X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and in situ electro-impedance spectroscopy. Synchrotron X-ray studies have enabled the characterisation of stresses, tetragonal phase fraction, and texture in the oxide as well as the stresses in the metal substrate. It was found that in the thick oxide (here, Optimized-ZIRLO, a trademark of the Westinghouse Electric Company, tested at 415°C in steam) a significant stress profile can be observed, which cannot be explained by metal substrate creep alone but that local delamination of the oxide layers due to crack formation must also play an important role. It was also found that the oxide stresses in the monoclinic and tetragonal phases grown on Zircaloy-4 (autoclave testing at 360°C) first relax during the pre-transition stage. Just before transition, the compressive stress in the monoclinic phase suddenly rises, which is interpreted as indirect evidence of significant tetragonal to monoclinic phase transformation taking place at this stage. TEM studies of pre- and post-transition oxides grown on ZIRLO, a trademark of the Westinghouse Electric Company, have used Fresnel contrast imaging to identify nano-sized pores along the columnar grain boundaries that form a network interconnected once the material goes through transition. The development of porosity during transition was further confirmed by in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies. 3DAP analysis was used to identify a ZrO sub-oxide layer at the metal/oxide interface and to establish its three-dimensional morphology. It was possible to demonstrate that this sub-oxide structure develops with time and changes dramatically around transition. This observation was further confirmed by in situ EIS studies, which also suggest thinning of the sub-oxide/barrier layer around transition. Finally, 3DAP analysis was used to characterise segregation of alloying elements near the metal/oxide interface and to establish that the corroding metal near the interface (in this case ZIRLO) after 100 days at 360°C displays a substantially different chemistry and microstructure compared to the base alloy with Fe segregating to the Zr/ZrO interface.

Surface heat flux estimation with the ensemble Kalman smoother: Joint estimation of state and parameters
1 The estimation of surface heat fluxes based on the assimilation of land surface temperature (LST) has been achieved within a variational data assimilation (VDA) framework. Variational approaches require the development of an adjoint model, which is difficult to derive and code in the presence of thresholds and discontinuities. Also, it is computationally expensive to obtain the background error covariance for the variational approaches. Moreover, the variational schemes cannot directly provide statistical information on the accuracy of their estimates. To overcome these shortcomings, we develop an alternative data assimilation (DA) procedure based on ensemble Kalman smoother (EnKS) with the state augmentation method. The unknowns of the assimilation scheme are neutral turbulent heat transfer coefficient (that scales the sum of turbulent heat fluxes) and evaporative fraction, EF (that represents partitioning among the turbulent fluxes). The new methodology is illustrated with an application to the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project Field Experiment (FIFE) that includes areal average hydrometeorological forcings and flux observations. The results indicate that the EnKS model not only provides reasonably accurate estimates of EF and turbulent heat fluxes but also enables us to determine the uncertainty of estimations under various land surface hydrological conditions. The results of the EnKS model are also compared with those of an optimal smoother (a dynamic variational model). It is found that the EnKS model estimates are less than optimal. However, the degree of suboptimality is small, and its outcomes are roughly comparable to those of an optimal smoother. Overall, the results from this test indicate that EnKS is an efficient and flexible data assimilation procedure that is able to extract useful information on the partitioning of available surface energy from LST measurements and eventually provides reliable estimates of turbulent heat fluxes.

A Review of Piggy Bank and How it Compares to SADIe (SADie Technical Report)
The Semantic Web vision is one where information and presentation are separated in order for automated tools and computer agents to find and extract the information that the user wants more accurately.  To be able to do this, machines will need to be able to freely access data and information contained within web documents and for these documents to be reasoned over.  Piggy Bank is a tool which attempts to extract pure data from a web page in order to provide users with some of the information retrieval power of the Semantic Web without fully adopting the tools and technologies that will be required for the Semantic Web to come into existence.  SADIe is a tool that uses the structure of the web page in order to transcode it so that it better suits the accessibility needs of the user.  This paper will look at what Piggy bank can do with the data it extracts from a web page and how this compares with SADIe.

[infection, fungal, diagnosis, systemic]

New perspectives in the diagnosis of systemic fungal infections.
Profound and prolonged neutropenia following chemotherapy is a major risk factor for systemic fungal infections. Mortality associated with disseminated fungal infection is high, and treatment with conventional amphotericin B is complicated by renal toxicity. Candida and Aspergillus are among the major pathogens in these patients. Many patients remaining neutropenic over a prolonged period of time will receive empirical antifungal therapy. The clinical and laboratory diagnoses of these infections are neither sensitive nor specific and are generally limited in the early detection of invasive fungal infection. However, several new approaches to diagnosis are being developed, which should be translated into routine practice, based on a greater understanding of the pathogenesis of systemic fungal infection and virulence determinants of fungal pathogens. These include antigen detection and polymerase chain reaction. Patients with presumed fungal infection require more intense and accurate monitoring for signs of disseminated infection. Early diagnosis may guide appropriate treatment and prevent mortality. Continued development of commercial tests should help achieve the objective of definitive diagnostic tests for systemic fungal infections.

The effect of flavin electron shuttles in microbial fuel cells current production
The effect of electron shuttles on electron transfer to microbial fuel cell (MFC) anodes was studied in systems where direct contact with the anode was precluded. MFCs were inoculated with Shewanella cells, and flavins used as the electron shuttling compound. In MFCs with no added electron shuttles, flavin concentrations monitored in the MFCs' bulk liquid increased continuously with FMN as the predominant flavin. The maximum concentrations were 0.6 mu M for flavin mononucleotide and 0.2 mu M for riboflavin. In MFCs with added flavins, micro-molar concentrations were shown to increase current and power output. The peak current was at least four times higher in MFCs with high concentrations of flavins (4.5-5.5 mu M) than in MFCs with low concentrations (0.2-0.6 mu M). Although high power outputs (around 150 mW/m(2)) were achieved in MFCs with high concentrations of flavins, a Clostridium-like bacterium along with other reactor limitations affected overall coulombic efficiencies (CE) obtained, achieving a maximum CE of 13\%. Electron shuttle compounds (flavins) permitted bacteria to utilise a remote electron acceptor (anode) that was not accessible to the cells allowing current production until the electron donor (lactate) was consumed.

Cav1 suppresses tumor growth and metastasis in a murine model of cutaneous SCC through modulation of MAPK/AP-1 activation.
Caveolin-1 (Cav1) is a scaffolding protein that serves to regulate the activity of several signaling molecules. Its loss has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several types of cancer, but its role in the development and progression of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) remains largely unexplored. Herein, we use the keratinocyte cell line PAM212, a murine model of cSCC, to determine the function of Cav1 in skin tumor biology. We first show that Cav1 overexpression decreases cell and tumor growth, whereas Cav1 knockdown increases these attributes in PAM212 cells. In addition, Cav1 knockdown increases the invasive ability and incidence of spontaneous lymph node metastasis. Finally, we demonstrate that Cav1 knockdown increases extracellular signaling-related kinase 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase/activator protein-1 pathway activation. We attribute the growth and invasive advantage conferred by Cav1 knockdown to increased expression of activator protein-1 transcriptional targets, including cyclin D1 and keratin 18, which show inverse expression in PAM212 based on the expression level of Cav1. In summary, we demonstrate that loss of Cav1 affects several characteristics associated with aggressive human skin tumors and that this protein may be an important modulator of tumor growth and invasion in cSCC.

User-Centered Design of a Visual Data Mapping Tool
Understanding the meaning and the type of a business document received by a company is important in order to determine an appropriate response. We have developed a visual tool allowing ordinary users to express mappings between arriving documents and their elements on one side and the different document types on the other. The tool is used to set up and continuously update an automatic semantic analysis mechanism which determines the document type from a set of information items contained in the document, thus allowing automatic processing associated with the types to be applied to the arriving document instances. The activities performed by end users within the visual data mapping tool are quite complex and require user-centric design to ensure tool is useful and usable. In this paper we describe the user-centric process informing the design of the tool. We conducted two workshops to discover the mental models of our users regarding the information content in their documents and their requirements towards the design of the tool. Subsequently, these findings were used to design and implement the visual data mapping tool. The resulting system was evaluated by target end users who proficiently demonstrated the usability of the developed concepts and features.

Efficacy and safety of the peripheral kappa agonist fedotozine versus placebo in the treatment of functional dyspepsia.
BACKGROUND: Peripheral kappa receptor agonists may provide a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of functional dyspepsia. AIMS: To evaluate, in a large multicentre trial, the use of the kappa receptor agonist fedotozine to improve symptoms associated with functional dyspepsia. METHODS: Two or more of the following persistent symptoms were required for inclusion: epigastric pain, early satiety, epigastric fullness or distension, nausea, vomiting, and a feeling of slow digestion. On completing a two week placebo washout, 271 patients were randomised into two groups to receive 30 mg fedotozine three times daily or placebo for six weeks under double blind conditions. RESULTS: The improvement in the overall intensity of dyspeptic symptoms (main efficacy criterion) was significantly more pronounced in the fedotozine group (p = 0.002) compared with placebo, as was epigastric pain (p = 0.004) and nausea (p = 0.01); the improvement in postprandial fullness was nearly significant (p = 0.052). Inability to finish a meal and slow digestion were unaffected. The patient global score, the average of the five individual symptoms, was notably ameliorated with fedotozine (p = 0.021). The safety of fedotozine was excellent. CONCLUSIONS: Fedotozine at 30 mg three times daily is safe and more effective than placebo for the relief of key symptoms associated with functional dyspepsia.

Sedation & immunomodulation.
The management of critically ill patients necessitates the use of sedatives and analgesics to provide patient comfort and cooperation. These drugs exert profound effects on all organ systems, not only the central nervous system, and this article describes the immunologic effects of the commonly used critical care sedatives: propofol, the benzodiazepines, opioids, and alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists. Benzodiazepines, opioids, and possibly even propofol worsen outcome in animal models of infection, whereas preliminary evidence suggests that the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist, dexmedetomidine, may improve outcomes in the setting of infection. Given the burden of sepsis and secondary infections in critical care, choice of sedation may need to be carefully considered to preserve immune responses in critically ill patients.

Short versus conventional term glucocorticoid therapy in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - the "REDUCE" trial.
BACKGROUND: International guidelines advocate a 10 to 14-day course of systemic glucocorticoid therapy in the management of COPD exacerbations. The optimal duration of therapy is unknown and glucocorticoids have serious adverse effects. The aim of this trial is to demonstrate non-inferiority of a five-day compared to a 14-day course of systemic glucocorticoids with respect to COPD outcome, thereby significantly reducing steroid exposure and side effects in patients with COPD exacerbations. METHODS: This is a randomised, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority multicentre trial. Patients with acute COPD exacerbation are randomised to receive 40 mg of prednisone-equivalent daily for 14 days (conventional arm) or glucocorticoid treatment for 5 days, followed by placebo for another 9 days (intervention arm). Follow-up is 180 days. The primary endpoint is time to next exacerbation. Secondary endpoints include cumulative glucocorticoid dose, time to open-label glucocorticoid therapy, glucocorticoid-associated side effects and complications, duration of hospital stay, death, change in FEV1, need for assisted ventilation, clinical outcome assessed by standardised questionnaires, and suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. RESULTS: Mean age (± SD) of patients who finished the study was 70 ± 11 years. 12% had mild or moderate disease, whereas severe and very severe stages were found in 30 and 58%, respectively. At the time of inclusion, 20% of patients were under treatment with systemic glucocorticoids. CONCLUSIONS: If the strategy of significantly reducing cumulative exposure to glucocorticoids while taking advantage of their beneficial short-term effects proves to be successful, it will warrant a change in common glucocorticoid prescription practice, thereby improving the management of COPD.

For the past five years we have been using a method inspired by the just-in-time-teachingapproach to teach our first year Newtonian mechanics class, which typically contains 240-280 students. This replaced a standard course, that did not engage the students sufficiently.With such a large cohort, it is difficult to mark students' assessments quickly, and give therequired feedback in a timely manner. We discuss how we capture students‟ marks andcommon difficulties in a short period, so we can plan an example class addressing these.We explain why we have chosen a commercial e-assessment tool. We discuss the types ofassignments available, especially those which allow for algebraic answers, and show whichtypes of assessments were found most effective, and describe the underlying reasons. Wewill specifically discuss the steps that were needed to take to create a positive experiencefor the students—our initial experience was quite negative, and influenced the students'engagement.We discuss in detail the important lessons we have learned about the mechanisms of qualitycontrol that underlie the use of online mathematical assessments. The core step in ourmethod is to use student answers to test the quality of questions. The way of performingquality tests is highly non-trivial and time-consuming, but is crucially important. Finally, weshall discuss further developments that would make this type of rich assessment more usefulto the students.

Results of a phase I study of AZD4547, an inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), in patients with advanced solid tumors
Background: AZD4547 is an orally bioavailable, selective inhibitor of FGFR 1, 2, and 3, with activity in a wide range of cell lines and xenografts dependent upon FGFR signalling, including patient-derived explant models with FGFR gene amplification.Methods: A 3-part study of AZD4547 was initiated in patients with advanced solid tumors (NCT00979134): Part A to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or continuous tolerable dose (RD); Part B to characterize the pharmacokinetic and safety profile (Parts A and B unselected for FGFR amplification); Part C1 to assess safety and clinical activity of AZD4547 (80 mg bid continuous dosing) in patients with advanced solid tumors prospectively selected for amplification of FGFR 1 and 2. FGFR gene amplification status was determined using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of archival or fresh tumor tissue. Pharmacodynamic biomarkers including phosphate and FGF23 were assessed in plasma samples.Results: At data cut-off (15 January 2013), 43 patients had been treated (dose range 20-200 mg bid) in the dose-escalation phase (Part A) of this study, and the RD was determined as 80 mg bid continuous dosing. Dose-limiting toxicities included increased liver enzymes, stomatitis, renal failure, hyperphosphataemia, and mucositis. In the dose-expansion phase of the study (Part B), a total of 6 patients were treated to confirm the tolerability of the RD. In Part C1, 21 patients with FGFR 1 or 2 amplified tumors received AZD4547 80 mg bid; these patients had diverse tumor types and a range of gene copy number gain (mostly low gene copy number <6). One squamous NSCLC patient in the C1 arm, with high copy number FGFR 1 amplification and who had received 2 previous lines of anti-cancer therapy, experienced a partial response lasting 12 weeks (patient discontinued study treatment due to RECIST disease progression at 24 weeks). An additional 4 patients in Part C1 had long periods of disease stabilization (≥24 weeks; advanced breast cancer n=1, squamous NSCLC n=1 and transitional cell carcinoma n=2). Pharmacokinetic data were generally both predictable and linear. The most common adverse events (AEs) reported were hyperphosphataemia, dry skin and mucous membranes, and retinal pigmented epithelial detachment (RPED). AEs were generally mild to moderate and reversible. Parts C2 (squamous NSCLC) and C3 (gastric cancer) are ongoing.Conclusions: AZD4547 80 mg bid continuous dosing was generally tolerated. Encouraging evidence of anti-tumor activity was seen in some patients, most notably a partial response in a patient with squamous NSCLC who had a high level FGFR gene amplification. Pharmacodynamic plasma biomarker data will be presented. Studies remain ongoing in patients with tumors selected for high levels of FGFR amplification.

Modeling of monostatic bottom backscattering from three-dimensional volume inhomogeneities and comparisons with experimental data
Acoustic propagation in the ocean inevitably encounters inhomogeneities of various
types, which give rise to scattering. Acoustic scattering from rough water /bottom
interfaces comprised of exposed rocks and sea mountains gives way to volumetric
scattering in areas with fiat interfaces and thick sediment cover. The data analysis
of the ARSRP backscattering experiment revealed that random inhomogeneities in
two irregular layers beneath the seafloor were the primary contributors to oblique
backscattering in a sediment pond on the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. In
this thesis, an attempt has been made to model monostatic backscattering from 3-D
volume inhomogeneities in the sediment and to compare the results with the ARSRP
backscattering data.
A scattering process cannot be modeled correctly without a proper account of the
incident field . Several approximate propagation models have been evaluated against
the exact solution, while the appropriateness of using the equivalent surface scattering
strength in volume scattering characterizations is studied. This study concludes
that precautions need to be taken in modeling both the propagation effects and the
scattering mechanisms associated with the bottom volume scattering process.
A volume scattering model based on perturbation theory and the Born approximation
is developed incorporating contributions from both sound speed and density
fluctuations. With the propagation part handled accurately by OASES and random
fluctuations generated effectively by a new scheme modified from the spectral method,
the model is capable of simulating the monostatic backscattered field and time series
due to 3-D volumetric sediment inhomogeneities. Both the characteristic length scale
and power spectrum descriptions of the random inhomogeneities are shown to have
great impact on the backscattered field by parameter studies in a free-space scenario.
The important roles played by horizontal anisotropy and the vertical correlation of
the random field have been demonstrated. Density fluctuations are further confirmed
to be the dominant force in backscattering. The model matches the ARSRP backscattering
data very well, with the fluctuations of sound speed and density in the two
irregular layers described by a power law type of power spectrum.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution September 199

PERT: A Method for Expression Deconvolution of Human Blood Samples from Varied Microenvironmental and Developmental Conditions
The cellular composition of heterogeneous samples can be predicted using an expression deconvolution algorithm to decompose their gene expression profiles based on pre-defined, reference gene expression profiles of the constituent populations in these samples. However, the expression profiles of the actual constituent populations are often perturbed from those of the reference profiles due to gene expression changes in cells associated with microenvironmental or developmental effects. Existing deconvolution algorithms do not account for these changes and give incorrect results when benchmarked against those measured by well-established flow cytometry, even after batch correction was applied. We introduce PERT, a new probabilistic expression deconvolution method that detects and accounts for a shared, multiplicative perturbation in the reference profiles when performing expression deconvolution. We applied PERT and three other state-of-the-art expression deconvolution methods to predict cell frequencies within heterogeneous human blood samples that were collected under several conditions (uncultured mono-nucleated and lineage-depleted cells, and culture-derived lineage-depleted cells). Only PERT's predicted proportions of the constituent populations matched those assigned by flow cytometry. Genes associated with cell cycle processes were highly enriched among those with the largest predicted expression changes between the cultured and uncultured conditions. We anticipate that PERT will be widely applicable to expression deconvolution strategies that use profiles from reference populations that vary from the corresponding constituent populations in cellular state but not cellular phenotypic identity.

Listeria monocytogenes - Understanding the interaction of pathogen and host physiology during intracellular growth
Listeria monocytogenes (L.monocytogenes) are Gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic and intracellular bacilli, occupying a wide range of ecological niches and are responsible for a number of serious infections in man. Primarily transmitted to humans through contaminated food stocks, L.monocytogenes invade mammalian cells in a phagosome, escaping and growing in the cell cytoplasm. Currently, there is a great deal of information about pathogenesis of L.monocytogenes, however, much less is known about the physiology of the bacteria. In particular, very little is known about the physiology during intracellular growth and even less about host cell physiology and changes in response to infection. The focus of this research was to address these issues using a multidisciplinary approach, utilising multiple biological techniques. The catabolic metabolism of L.monocytogenes was elucidated using mutagenesis and protein purification studies. The results are not completely conclusive; however, it was shown that unlike in Escherichia coli, L.moncytogenes may not be dependent on fermentation enzymes Ldh and Pflb during anaerobic growth. Instead anaerobic respiration is hypothesised, utilising a putative fumarate reductase with fumarate as a terminal electron acceptor. The putative fumarate reductase gene was purified and confirmed to have enzymatic activity.External and internal metabolism of HeLa cells, and the effect of L.monocytogenes infection was elucidated by mass spectrometry. The external metabolomic studies proved inconclusive. The internal metabolomic studies show that a number of key amino acids are being sequestered by L.monocytogenes during the course of an infection. Also, the studies show that a large number of carbon compounds are being sequestered by L.monocytogenes, pointing to a complex carbon metabolism for L.monocytogenes during intracellular growth.  A targeted analysis of the nitrogen metabolism of L.monocytogenes has shown that L.monocytogenes may utilise a number of nitrogen compounds with glutamine and glutamate being particularly important. The ability to synthesise glutamine de novo is shown to be essential for normal intracellular growth.

Large-Scale On-Chip Dynamic Programming Network Inferences using Moderated Inter-Core Communication
The analysis of large scale, complex networks using dynamic programming is of great use in many scientific and engineering disciplines. Current applications often require the analysis of scale-free networks with many millions of nodes and edges, presenting a huge computational challenge. Employing a distributed networks-on-chip infrastructure presents a unique opportunity of delivering power efficient and massive parallel accelerations. However, bursting and asymmetric communications across cores could create instant network saturation and lead to packet loss and performance degradation. In this paper, we present a moderated communication methodology that enables a balanced channel usage and network topological adaptation for improved performance. A novel analytical communication model for NoC is developed and leads to a theoretical bound of the on-chip communication cost estimate. Performances of the many-core computation and the proposed methods are rigorously evaluated using the real 18-core Spinnaker chip. We demonstrate a 10x speed-up in analysis convergence and a 42% reduction in instantaneous Packet Injection Rate based on benchmark networks.

[cycle, menstrual, anorectal, menses, stool, phase, rectal, time, looser, physiology]

Does the menstrual cycle affect anorectal physiology?
It has been shown that during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle women excrete hard stools and have delayed transit, while at the time of menses, stools are looser and more frequent. The relationship between the menstrual cycle and anorectal physiology, and whether the timing of manometry testing should be standardized within the menstrual cycle has not been previously investigated. In this study, the anorectal responses to balloon distension during days 1-4 (menses), 8-10 (follicular phase), 18-20 (luteal phase) and 24-28 (premenstrual) of the menstrual cycle in 20 healthy female volunteers (ages 18-39 years) was measured. Stools were significantly looser during menses 2.32 (2.1-2.5); mean (95% CI) compared with the luteal phase 1.98 (1.8-2.2): F(3,30) = 3.1; P < 0.04). However, there were no changes in rectal sensitivity, distension-induced rectal motility, rectal compliance, or the volumes required to induce the initial and sustained internal aral sphincter relaxations. In conclusion, although stools become looser at the time of menses, anorectal responses to balloon distension are unaltered. This suggests that the changes in bowel habit associated with the menstrual cycle are unrelated to changes in anorectal physiology. Furthermore, routine manometric testing can be performed at any time during the menstrual cycle without fear of conflicting results.

[stroke, immune, outcome, activation, systemic, system]

Systemic immune activation shapes stroke outcome.
Stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and activation of the immune system can impact on stroke outcome. Although the majority of research has focused on the role of the immune system after stroke there is increasing evidence to suggest that inflammation and immune activation prior to brain injury can influence stroke risk and outcome. With the high prevalence of co-morbidities in the Western world such as obesity, hypertension and diabetes, pre-existing chronic 'low-grade' systemic inflammation has become a customary characteristic of stroke pathophysiology that needs to be considered in the search for new therapies. The importance of the immune system in stroke has been demonstrated in a number of ways, both experimentally and in the clinical setting. This review will focus on the effect of immune activation arising from systemic inflammatory conditions and infection, how it affects the incidence and outcomes of stroke, and the possible underlying mechanisms involved.

The mechanical environment in dupuytren's contracture determines cell contractility and associated MMP-mediated matrix remodeling.
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are expressed in Dupuytren's contracture and play a role in matrix remodeling. We tested the role of tension on contractility and MMP expression in Dupuytren's nodule and cord cells. Cells were subjected to pre-determined loading patterns of known repeatable magnitudes (static load, unloading, and overloading) and tested for MMP gene expression (MMP-1, -2, -9, -13, and TIMP-1, -2) and force generation using a tension-culture force monitor. Matrix remodeling was assessed by addition of cytochalasin D and residual matrix tension was quantified. Nodule compared to cord and control cells demonstrate greater force generation and remodeling (p < 0.05). Nodule cells subjected to a reduced load and overloading led to threefold increase of MMP-1, -2, and -9 compared to static load, whilst cord and control cells only showed a twofold increase of MMP-9. Nodule cells subjected to overloading showed a twofold increase in TIMP-2 expression, whilst cord and control cells showed a twofold increase in TIMP-1 expression. Nodule cells differ from cord cells by increased force generation in response to changes in the mechanical environment and related MMP/TIMP-mediated matrix remodeling. In turn this may lead to permanent matrix shortening and digital contracture. Interventional therapies should be aimed at nodule cells to prevent contraction and subsequent permanent matrix remodeling. © 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

[il-2, methylation, hospital, asthma, child, admission, site1, exacerbation, age]

Methylation of IL-2 promoter at birth alters the risk of asthma exacerbations during childhood.
BACKGROUND: Epigenetic modifications may have a role in asthma susceptibility. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether epigenetic modification at birth of a CpG site necessary for the regulation of IL-2 transcription (IL-2 Site1) is associated with the development of asthma during childhood. METHODS: Methylation of IL-2 Site1 was assessed in cord blood from 303 children (225 with atopic mothers); as controls, we measured methylation of a site not important in the transcription of IL-2 (IL-2 Site7) and methylation of the LINE-1 repetitive element. Children were followed to the age of 8 years. Information on severe asthma exacerbations and hospital admissions was collected from child's primary care medical record. To account for potential confounding by bronchiolitis, we used exacerbations/hospitalizations after age 1 year as primary outcomes. RESULTS: There were 49 severe exacerbations amongst 33 children, and 22 hospital admissions amongst 11 children. The risk of asthma exacerbation increased 1.07-fold (95% CI 1.01-1.14, P = 0.03) and the risk of hospital admission increased 1.12-fold (95% CI 1.04-1.20, P = 0.002) for each one per cent increase in IL-2 Site1 methylation. Children who were admitted to hospital at any time-point had significantly higher IL-2 Site1 methylation than children not admitted to hospital (P = 0.007). There was a significant interaction between age at exacerbation (P = 0.03) or hospital admission (P = 0.02) and methylation, with the effect of methylation increasing with increasing age. Methylation of the control IL-2 Site7 or LINE-1 was not a significant predictor of asthma exacerbations/hospital admission, and we found no association between IL-2 Site1 methylation and hospital admissions for other reasons (0.99 0.92-1.06). Cord blood mononuclear cell phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphoproliferative responses decreased significantly with increasing IL-2 Site1 methylation (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing methylation in cord blood of a functional CpG site in the IL-2 promoter is associated with increased likelihood of severe asthma exacerbations and hospital admissions for asthma/wheeze between ages of 2 and 8 years.

Supporting the care of children with diabetes in school: a qualitative study of nurses in the UK
Aims Intensification of diabetes management in children and young people has implications for schools. The aim of this study was to examine the role of nurses in supporting care of children with diabetes in schools and early years settings. Methods The qualitative design incorporated focus groups and individual telephone interviews with nurses who were unavailable to participate in focus groups. A purposive sample of 47 nurses from acute and community settings, participated in eight focus groups and eight telephone interviews. Data were analysed through a process of constant comparison. Results Nurses identified an ambiguous and inadequate legal and policy framework. The responses of schools were variable and unpredictable because the views of head teachers determined the level of cooperation. School staff could lack basic knowledge about Type 1 diabetes. Relationships between school staff and parents could also affect their willingness to provide support for diabetes care. The skills of negotiating appropriate support for children with diabetes were learnt by experience rather than through formal training or evidence-based guidance. Nurses' accounts demonstrated uncertainties about: what could be required of schools; how schools would respond; individual responsibilities; and about what constituted best practice. Conclusions There is a need for more evidence about how healthcare providers can influence schools and about the most cost-effective use of nurses to support the management of children with diabetes in schools.

EPIDEMIOLOGY AND CLINICAL SPECTRUM OF CUTANEOUS DISEASES MANIFESTING AMONG NEWLY DIAGNOSED HIV SEROPOSITIVE ADULTS IN NAKURU COUNTY-KENYA.
Background. The skin is exceptionally vulnerable to various diseases in people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The prevalence of skin diseases in HIV varies by country and region. In Kenya, the prevalence, patterns and distribution of HIV-related skin diseases is unknown. Estimating the burden of HIV-related skin morbidity is important in planning skin care for HIV patients in any given community. It is necessary therefore to conduct such studies in Kenya. Method. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 394 newly diagnosed HIV seropositive patients seeking care at the HIV comprehensive care centre in Rift Valley Provincial Hospital. All patients were examined for skin diseases by two dermatologists for diagnostic concurrence.&nbsp; Their CD4 cell counts were analysed by the centre&rsquo;s laboratory technologist using Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorter (FACS) system.  Results. Women outnumbered men by 1.9:1. The overall mean age was 36.5 years (SD&plusmn;9.69) and the mean CD4 cell count was 251.7cells/mm3 (SD&plusmn;261.05). 42% (166/394) of the patients presented with one or more skin diseases. Oral thrush (6.3%), pruritic papular eruption (5%), seborrheic dermatitis (4.8%), eczema (4.3%), herpes zoster (3.6%), xerosis (2.8%) and vaginal candidiasis (2.8%) were the leading diseases. Oral thrush (p&lt;.019), pruritic papular eruption (p&lt;.012) and seborrheic dermatitis (p&lt;.001) were the only diseases with a significant correlation with lower CD4 cell counts. Conclusion. Skin diseases remain common among newly diagnosed adults with HIV in Nakuru County. Most of those with skin disease are severely immunodepressed and eligible for commencement of anti-retroviral therapy.  &nbsp; KEYWORDS: Epidemiology, skin diseases, HIV seropositive &nbsp; Received for Publication: 26/02/13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Accepted for Publication: 27/03/13  Corresponding author: lemawenzi@yahoo.com

A Technique for Performing Electrical Impedance Myography in the Mouse Hind Limb: Data in Normal and ALS SOD1 G93A Animals
Objective:
To test a method for performing electrical impedance myography (EIM) in the mouse hind limb for the assessment of disease status in neuromuscular disease models.
Methods:
An impedance measuring device consisting of a frame with electrodes embedded within an acrylic head was developed. The head was rotatable such that data longitudinal and transverse to the major muscle fiber direction could be obtained. EIM measurements were made with this device on 16 healthy mice and 14 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) animals. Repeatability was assessed in both groups.
Results:
The technique was easy to perform and provided good repeatability in both healthy and ALS animals, with intra-session repeatability (mean ± SEM) of 5% ±1% and 12% ±2%, respectively. Significant differences between healthy and ALS animals were also identified (e.g., longitudinal mean 50 kHz phase was 18±0.6° for the healthy animals and 14±1.0° for the ALS animals, p = 0.0025).
Conclusions:
With this simple device, the EIM data obtained is highly repeatable and can differentiate healthy from ALS animals.
Significance:
EIM can now be applied to mouse models of neuromuscular disease to assess disease status and the effects of therapy.

ORGANIC SEMICONDUCTORS FOR SELF-ASSEMBLED MONOLAYER FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTORS
Molecular self-assembly has recently attracted significant attention for possible application in organic electronic and optoelectronic devices, such as self-assembled monolayer field-effect transistors (SAMFETs) and functional self-assembled integrated circuits. Self-assembly combines the advantages of low temperature solution processability, regio-selective monolayer adsorption and nano-scale control of film thickness. Much progress has been made in improving device performance using self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). However, most SAMFET devices reported to date showed current modulation only with submicrometre channels, with low device yields and poor reproducibility as a result of limited lateral interconnection of the semiconducting layer.In an attempt to address these issues, this thesis presents an investigation of the synthesis and properties of conjugated SAM molecules for use as the charge transporting layer in SAMFETs. Chapter 1 gives a comprehensive introduction to SAM-based surface systems, organic semiconductors and their use in OFETs and SAMFETs. Chapter 2 discusses attempts to design and synthesise p-type conjugated molecules capable of self-assembly on oxide surfaces based on a phenylene-bithiophene semiconducting core. The optical and electrochemical properties, as well as the thermal behaviour of these molecules are studied in detail. This theme is carried over to Chapter 3, which describes the synthesis, chemical and physical characterisation of two families of n-type SAM molecules. These molecules consist of NTCDI cores with hexyl or cyclohexyl chains as end-capping groups. Incorporation of a selection of materials as the active layer in OFETs or SAMFETs to evaluate the charge transport is demonstrated in Chapter 4. Monolayer films based on p-type monochlorosilane-terminated SAM molecules are made using the solution assembly technique and characterised by contact angle and AFM. OFETs made from DH-PTTP by both thermal evaporation and spin coating show high mobilities comparable to the best values reported in the literature. Top-contact SAMFETs show a hole mobility of 1.1 × 10-3 cm2V-1s-1 in air, consistent with those of solution processed DH-PTTP based OFETs. Finally, an overview of the project and some suggestions for future work are presented in Chapter 5.

Modified expression of the ADAMTS enzymes and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 during human intervertebral disc degeneration.
OBJECTIVE: Intervertebral disc degeneration is linked to loss of extracellular matrix (ECM), particularly the early loss of aggrecan. A group of metalloproteinases called aggrecanases are important mediators of aggrecan turnover. The present study was undertaken to investigate the expression of the recognized aggrecanases and their inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP-3), in human intervertebral disc tissue. METHODS: Twenty-four nondegenerated and 30 degenerated disc samples were analyzed for absolute messenger RNA (mRNA) copy number of ADAMTS 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 15 and TIMP-3 by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Thirty-six formalin-fixed embedded intervertebral disc samples of varying grades of degeneration were used for immunohistochemical analyses. In addition, samples from 8 subjects were analyzed for the presence of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)- and aggrecanase-generated aggrecan products. RESULTS: Messenger RNA for all the aggrecanases other than ADAMTS-8 was identified in intervertebral disc tissue, as was mRNA for TIMP-3. Levels of mRNA expression of ADAMTS 1, 4, 5, and 15 were significantly increased in degenerated tissue compared with nondegenerated tissue. All these aggrecanases and TIMP-3 were also detected immunohistochemically in disc tissue, and numbers of nucleus pulposus cells staining positive for ADAMTS 4, 5, 9, and 15 were significantly increased in degenerated tissue compared with nondegenerated tissue. Aggrecan breakdown products generated by MMP and aggrecanase activities were also detected in intervertebral disc tissue. CONCLUSION: The aggrecanases ADAMTS 1, 4, 5, 9, and 15 may contribute to the changes occurring in the ECM during intervertebral disc degeneration. Targeting these enzymes may be a possible future therapeutic strategy for the prevention of intervertebral disc degeneration and its associated morbidity.

Acupuncture for irritable bowel syndrome: primary care based pragmatic randomised controlled trial.
ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Acupuncture is used by patients as a treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) but the evidence on effectiveness is limited. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture for irritable bowel syndrome in primary care when provided as an adjunct to usual care. METHODS: Design: A two-arm pragmatic randomised controlled trial.Setting: Primary care in the United Kingdom.Patients: 233 patients had irritable bowel syndrome with average duration of 13 years and score of at least 100 on the IBS Symptom Severity Score (SSS).Interventions: 116 patients were offered 10 weekly individualised acupuncture sessions plus usual care, 117 patients continued with usual care alone.Measurements: Primary outcome was the IBS SSS at three months, with outcome data collected every three months to 12 months. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between groups at three months favouring acupuncture with a reduction in IBS Symptom Severity Score of -27.43 (95% CI: --48.66 to -6.21, p = 0.012). The number needed to treat for successful treatment (>=50 point reduction in the IBS SSS) was six (95% CI: 3 to 17), based on 49% success in the acupuncture group vs. 31% in the control group, a difference between groups of 18% (95% CI: 6% to 31%). This benefit largely persisted at 6, 9 and 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture for irritable bowel syndrome provided an additional benefit over usual care alone. The magnitude of the effect was sustained over the longer term. Acupuncture should be considered as a treatment option to be offered in primary care alongside other evidenced based treatments.Trial RegistrationCurrent Controlled Trials ISRCTN08827905.

Solvation pressure in a Lennard-Jones fluid by molecular dynamics simulation
<p>We present molecular dynamics simulations of a simple dimer immersed in a Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid to test the validity of the solvation pressure model in a system where we attempt to isolate the general and ubiquitous solvation pressure. The solvated dimer acts as a simple pressure gauge in a system where the cohesive energy density (CED) of the solvent is fixed. We study the dimer bond length as a function of uniform hydrostatic pressure and as a function of a scaling parameter x which changes the attractive component of the LJ solvent-solute interaction. For small x, or weak solvent-solute attractive interactions, the liquid bond lengths are dominated by repulsive interactions, but at higher values of x strong solvent-solute interactions produce a "packing effect" that is the dominant factor. We find that the change in bond length between vapor and liquid is consistent with the solvation pressure model for only a narrow range of x. Despite the simplicity of the system, departure from the solvation pressure model and an increase in the dimer bond length with increasing pressure are observed which is consistent with experimental observations of real liquids and normally attributed to masking effects. The existence and impact of these effects are explained in terms of CED, axial forces, and axial pressures.</p>

Bowel obstruction in ovarian and peritoneal malignancy: The Christie Hospital (Manchester, UK) experience.
Bowel Obstruction in Ovarian and Peritoneal Malignancy: The Christie Hospital (Manchester, UK) ExperienceBACKGROUND: Bowel obstruction is a common clinical problem in advanced ovarian and peritoneal malignancy and is associated with a poor prognosis. We previously correlated clinical & radiological factors with outcome demonstrating that significant improvements in overall survival can be gained in a minority of patients1. Here, we extend our analysis to 130 patients with biopsy-proven disease admitted between 2003-2011 with the aims of identifying patients most likely to derive benefit from palliative surgery and/or chemotherapy. RESULTS: The median time from diagnosis to inpatient admission with bowel obstruction was 493 days (range 0-5640). The most common histology was serous adenocarcinoma (44%). The median inpatient stay was 20 days (range 3-110); total parenteral nutrition was instigated in 22% (median duration 14 days). The majority of patients had high (> 5cm) tumour burden at multiple sites, radiological evidence of serosal disease and half developed bowel obstruction whilst receiving chemotherapy. Approximately 50% of patients presented with obstructive symptoms, but 25% presented with erratic bowel habit. Median survival following the first episode of bowel obstruction was 87 days (range 3-1754). Survival was similar between patients who underwent palliative surgery or chemotherapy (p=0.89). Median survival for patients presenting in bowel obstruction with platinum-sensitive (PS) and platinum-resistant (PR) disease (but not chemonaïve patients) who proceeded to chemotherapy was prolonged compared with patients unsuitable for further treatment (PS 191 vs. 24 days, p<0.0001; PR 149 vs. 50 days, p=0.06). A feasibility trial investigating the efficacy of low residue diet and intravenous dexamethasone in the prevention and treatment of malignant bowel obstruction has been initiated.CONCLUSION: Overall survival in patients with malignant bowel obstruction is poor with no significant improvement over the last decade. Bowel obstruction in patients with chemonaïve disease represents an aggressive phenotype with poor prognosis. Judicious selection of patients for surgery and/or chemotherapy can significantly increase survival.

Population-Based 20-Year Survival Among People Diagnosed With Thin Melanomas in Queensland, Australia
PURPOSE: The 20-year survival rates are unknown for the majority of melanoma patients-those with thin melanomas. We determined 20-year survival rates of patients diagnosed with thin melanomas (≤ 1.00 mm) in the general population and also determined the main prognostic factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Available clinical and histologic data from the Queensland Cancer Registry were obtained for all patients diagnosed with a single thin invasive melanoma from 1982 to 2006 and matched against national death registration data. Melanoma-specific survival estimates to December 31, 2007, were assessed, and subgroup differences in prognosis were determined by fitting multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Among 26,736 people in the state of Queensland diagnosed with thin melanomas, the 20-year survival was 96%. The most influential determinants of prognosis were tumor thickness ≥ 0.75 mm (adjusted hazard ratio HR, 4.33; 95% CI, 2.8 to 6.8 compared with tumors < 0.25 mm) and patient age at diagnosis older than 65 years (HR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.8 to 4.5) compared with age younger than 25 years. Acral lentiginous and nodular tumors, male sex, tumor site on the scalp or neck, or tumor invasion of the entire papillary dermis each independently increased the risk of dying from thin invasive melanoma. CONCLUSION: The outlook for patients with thin invasive melanoma is positive, although continued clinical vigilance is warranted for patients with nodular melanoma and those with the thickest tumors.

2,4,6-Octatrienoic acid is a novel promoter of melanogenesis and antioxidant defence in normal human melanocytes via PPAR-γ activation.
Given the importance of the tanning response in protecting human skin from the harmful effects of UV radiation, one important research priority is to identify novel molecules that are capable of promoting pigmentation and/or antioxidant defence. Parrodienes share some structural features with carotenoids and retinoids, stimulate cell antioxidant defence and counteract senescence-like phenotype in fibroblasts. We selected the parrodiene-derivative 2,4,6-octatrienoic acid (Octa) to study its impact on key parameters of melanogenesis and antioxidant defence in organ-cultured human skin and in normal human melanocytes. Octa promoted melanogenesis by up-regulating tyrosinase and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor expression. This correlated with an increase of melanin content in both human epidermis in situ and cultured human epidermal melanocytes. Moreover, Octa increased the biological antioxidant potential content and the expression and activity of catalase. Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ was necessary to evoke these effects. These data strongly encourage the systematic study of Octa as a novel candidate promoter of human skin photoprotection.

User-centred design of flexible hypermedia for a mobile guide: reflections on the hyperaudio experience
A user-centred design approach involves end-users from the very beginning. Considering users at the early stages compels designers to think in terms of utility and usability and helps develop a system based on what is actually needed. This paper discusses the case of HyperAudio, a context-sensitive adaptive and mobile museum guide developed in the late 1990s. User requirements were collected via a survey to understand visitors' profiles and visit styles in natural science museums. The knowledge acquired supported the specification of system requirements, helping define the user model, data structure and adaptive behaviour of the system. User requirements guided the design decisions on what could be implemented by using simple adaptable triggers, and what instead needed more sophisticated adaptive techniques. This is a fundamental choice when all the computation must be done on a PDA. Graphical and interactive environments for developing and testing complex adaptive systems are discussed as a further step in an iterative design process that considers the user interaction to be the central point. This paper discusses how such an environment allows designers and developers to experiment with different system behaviours and to widely test it under realistic conditions by simulating the actual context evolving over time. The understanding gained in HyperAudio is then considered from the perspective of later developments: our findings still appers to be valid despite the time that had passed.

Averaging of fish target strength functions
A general model for averaging the acoustic target strength functions of fish is stated in calculable form. It accounts for the influences of the distribution of generally coupled spatial and orientation states of fish, geometric perspective, and beam patterns on observations of target strength. The model is developed and applied to observation of fish by directional, downward‐looking sonars. A particular example is considered in which the sonar is represented by an ideal circular piston, the spatial distribution of fish is homogeneous, and the orientation distribution is spatially homogeneous and characterized by a uniformily distributed azimuthal variable and an independent, essentially normally distributed tilt angle variable. Averaged and averaged‐squared backscattering cross sections are computed from high quality gadoid target strength functions measured at two ultrasonic frequencies. Results for a sonar half‐beamwidth of 2.5 deg for three different realizations of the tilt angle distribution are expressed in the logarithmic domain and regressed linearly on fish length. The significance of species, frequency, and orientation distribution differences among the regressions is noted. Estimates of the mean ratio of averaged‐squared backscattering cross section and squared‐averaged backscattering cross section are presented.Author Posting. © Acoustical Society of America, 1980.

Drug eluting stents for the treatment of bare metal in-stent restenosis: long-term outcomes in real world practice.
AIMS: Drug eluting stents (DES) have had a great impact in reducing in-stent restenosis (ISR) in de novo lesions. However, long-term data regarding effectiveness and safety of these stents in treating bare metal stent (BMS) ISR are limited. We report long-term clinical outcomes in a cohort of patients with BMS-ISR treated with DES between April 2002 and December 2003 at our institution. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-nine consecutive patients with significant BMS-ISR were treated with DES implantation. Sirolimus DES were used in 43 patients and paclitaxel DES in 26. All patients were followed up to determine the incidence of major adverse cardiac event (MACE) rates (all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularisation TVR), angina class and the need for clinically driven angiography. The mean age of the cohort was 58.6 ± 10.8 years; 68% were male, 33% were diabetic, 50% had hypertension, 78% were on statin therapy and 59% were current (19%) or previous (41%) smokers. The clinical presentation of ISR was with chronic stable angina in 54 patients, 12 had a non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome and three presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Multivessel stenting was performed in 21 patients and bifurcation stenting in seven patients. Over a mean follow period of 4.9 years, the first event MACE rate was 20% (17 events in 14 patients - eight deaths of which three were cardiac, two non-fatal myocardial infarctions and seven TVR). Excluding non-cardiac death, the adjusted MACE rate was 14.5% (12 events in 10 patients). At long-term follow-up, mean Canadian angina class decreased from 2.3 ± 0.7 pre-procedure to 1.2 ± 0.4, 65% of patients were angina free and 80% were free of MACE. No differences in long-term outcomes were observed between patients receiving paclitaxel and sirolimus DES. CONCLUSIONS: The use of DES for the treatment of BMS-ISR is safe and effective over a mean follow-up period of nearly five years. To our knowledge, this represents the longest follow-up data of real world patients treated in a single interventional centre.

High-spin isomeric structures in exotic odd-odd nuclei: Exploration of the proton drip line and beyond
<p>We investigate the role of two-quasiparticle isomeric states along the proton drip line, using configuration-constrained potential-energy-surface calculations. In contrast to even-even nuclei, odd-odd nuclei can have coexisting low-lying two-quasiparticle states. The low excitation energy and high angular momentum can lead to long-lived isomers. Also, because of the hindrance by spin selection, the probabilities of <i>beta</i> and proton decays from high-spin isomers can be reduced significantly. The present calculations reproduce reasonably well the available data for observed isomers in such nuclei. Unobserved high-spin isomers are predicted, which could be useful for future experimental studies of exotic nuclei at and beyond the proton drip line.</p>

[rfm, placental, fetal, placenta, structure, woman, function, movement, insufficiency, maternal]

Maternal perception of reduced fetal movements is associated with altered placental structure and function.
BACKGROUND: Maternal perception of reduced fetal movement (RFM) is associated with increased risk of stillbirth and fetal growth restriction (FGR). DFM is thought to represent fetal compensation to conserve energy due to insufficient oxygen and nutrient transfer resulting from placental insufficiency. To date there have been no studies of placental structure in cases of DFM. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether maternal perception of reduced fetal movements (RFM) is associated with abnormalities in placental structure and function. DESIGN: Placentas were collected from women with RFM after 28 weeks gestation if delivery occurred within 1 week. Women with normal movements served as a control group. Placentas were weighed and photographs taken. Microscopic structure was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining and image analysis. System A amino acid transporter activity was measured as a marker of placental function. Placentas from all pregnancies with RFM (irrespective of outcome) had greater area with signs of infarction (3.5% vs. 0.6%; p<0.01), a higher density of syncytial knots (p<0.001) and greater proliferation index (p<0.01). Villous vascularity (p<0.001), trophoblast area (p<0.01) and system A activity (p<0.01) were decreased in placentas from RFM compared to controls irrespective of outcome of pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of abnormal placental morphology and function in women with RFM and supports the proposition of a causal association between placental insufficiency and RFM. This suggests that women presenting with RFM require further investigation to identify those with placental insufficiency.

[lung, ltk63, infection, cell, immunity]

Innate imprinting by the modified heat-labile toxin of Escherichia coli (LTK63) provides generic protection against lung infectious disease.
In a healthy individual, the lung contains few lymphoid cells. However, amplified immune responses, as exemplified during lung infection, can cause extensive tissue damage. We have previously demonstrated that one lung infection modulates the immunopathological outcome to a subsequent unrelated pathogen. Mimicking heterologous immunity may provide a means of enhancing both innate and acquired immunity. We now show that prior lung administration of a modified heat-labile toxin from Escherichia coli (LTK63) enhances immunity to respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. Treatment with LTK63 decreased lung inflammation and tissue damage and improved the ability to resolve the infection. APCs expressing the activation markers MHC class II, CD80, and CD40 increased in number in the lung. LTK63 treatment increased the pathogen-specific IgA response in the nasal mucosa and simultaneously decreased inflammatory cytokine production (IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha) after infection. The number of activated CD8(+)CD44(+) T cells and the respiratory syncytial virus- or influenza-specific CD8-proliferative responses increased, although the total inflammatory infiltrate was reduced. LTK63 treatment matured lung APCs (LTK63 prevented efficient presentation of whole OVA to DO11.10 cells, whereas OVA peptide presentation was unaffected), enhanced immunity in both a Th1 and Th2 environment, was long lasting, and was not pathogen or host strain specific; the protective effects were partially independent of T and B cells. Innate imprinting by toxin-based immunotherapeutics may provide generic protection against infectious disease in the lung, without the need for coadministered pathogen-specific Ag.

Scalable communications for a million-core neural processing architecture
The design of a new high-performance computing platform to model biological neural networks requires scalable, layered communications in both hardware and software. SpiNNaker???s hardware is based upon Multi-Processor System-on-Chips (MPSoCs) with flexible, power-efficient, custom communication between processors and chips. The architecture scales from a single 18-processor chip to over 1 million processors and to simulations of billion-neuron, trillion-synapse models, with tens of trillions of neural spike-event packets conveyed each second. The communication networks and overlying protocols are key to the successful operation of the SpiNNaker architecture, designed together to maximise performance and minimise the power demands of the platform. SpiNNaker is a work in progress, having recently reached a major milestone with the delivery of the first MPSoCs. This paper presents the architectural justification, which is now supported by preliminary measured results of silicon performance, indicating that it is indeed scalable to a million-plus processor system.

[suicide, ward, in-patient, patient, psychiatric, clinical]

Suicide amongst psychiatric in-patients who abscond from the ward: a national clinical survey.
BACKGROUND: Suicide prevention by mental health services requires an awareness of the antecedents of suicide amongst high risk groups such as psychiatric in-patients. The goal of this study was to describe the social and clinical characteristics of people who had absconded from an in-patient psychiatric ward prior to suicide, including aspects of the clinical care they received. METHODS: We carried out a national clinical survey based on a 10-year (1997-2006) sample of people in England and Wales who had died by suicide. Detailed data were collected on those who had been in contact with mental health services in the year before death. RESULTS: There were 1,851 cases of suicide by current psychiatric in-patients, 14% of all patient suicides. 1,292 (70%) occurred off the ward. Four hundred and sixty-nine of these patients died after absconding from the ward, representing 25% of all in-patient suicides and 38% of those that occurred off the ward. Absconding suicides were characterised by being young, unemployed and homeless compared to those who were off the ward with staff agreement. Schizophrenia was the most common diagnosis, and rates of previous violence and substance misuse were high. Absconders were proportionally more likely than in-patients on agreed leave to have been legally detained for treatment, non-compliant with medication, and to have died in the first week of admission. Whilst absconding patients were significantly more likely to have been under a high level of observation, clinicians reported more problems in observation due to either the ward design or other patients on the ward. CONCLUSION: Measures that may prevent absconding and subsequent suicide amongst in-patients might include tighter control of ward exits, and more intensive observation of patients, particularly in the early days of admission. Improving the ward environment to provide a supportive and less intimidating experience may contribute to reduced risk.

Seasonal photosynthetic responses of European oaks to drought and elevated daytime temperature
Oaks are commonly considered as drought- and heat-tolerant trees that might benefit from a warmer and drier climate. Their tolerance to drought has been frequently studied in the past, whereas studies dealing with elevated temperature or its combination with drought are very limited in number. In this study we investigated seasonal photosynthetic patterns in three European oak species (Quercus robur, Q. petraea, Q. pubescens) exposed in lysimeter-based open-top chambers (OTC) to elevated daytime temperature, drought and their combination. Stomatal and non-stomatal traits of photosynthesis were followed over an entire growing season and related to changes in daytime temperature, soil moisture and pre-dawn leaf water potential (ΨPD). Elevated daytime temperature enhanced net photosynthesis (PN) in a season-dependent manner, with higher mid-summer rates than in controls exposed to ambient temperature. Drought imposed in early and mid-summer reduced the soil moisture content and caused a gradual decline in ΨPD, stomatal conductance (gS) and PN. Drought effects on ΨPD and PN were exacerbated when drought was combined with elevated daytime temperature. In general, PN tended to be more affected by low soil moisture content or low ΨPD in Q. robur than in Q. petraea and Q. pubescens. Non-stomatal limitations may have contributed to the drought-induced decline of PN in Q. robur, as indicated by a down-regulation of PSII photochemistry (FV/FM) and decreased chlorophyll content. Taken together, our findings show that European oaks may benefit from elevated temperature, but detrimental effects can be expected when elevated temperature occurs simultaneously with drought.

Evidence accumulation in multiobjective data clustering
Multiobjective approaches to data clustering return sets of solutions that correspond to trade-offs between different clustering objectives. Here, an established ensemble technique (evidence-accumulation) is applied to the identification of shared features within the set of clustering solutions returned by the multiobjective clustering method MOCK. We show that this approach can be employed to achieve a four-fold reduction in the number of candidate solutions,whilst maintaining the accuracy of MOCK’s best clustering solutions. We also find that the resulting knowledge provides a novel design basis for the visual exploration and comparison of different clustering solutions. There are clear parallels with recent work on ‘innovization’, where it was suggested that the design-space analysis of the solution sets returned by multiobjective optimization may provide deep insight into the core design principles of good solutions.

Identification of steroid sensitive responders versus non-responders in the treatment of keloid disease.
Intralesional corticosteroid injection is a well-recognised treatment modality for keloid disease (KD). Approximately 50 % of KD cases are considered non-responders (or steroid resistant) with no consensus or indicators in detecting steroid-sensitive cases. In view of the undesirable side effects, uncertainty in timing and regularity of steroid treatment, we planned to identify responders and non-responders to target treatment more effectively. A scar injection proforma was developed capturing a detailed history focusing on symptoms and signs (redness, appearance, contour, texture, distortion and severity) associated with KD. The cause, site, number of keloid scars and scar recurrence were recorded as the lesions were injected on a monthly basis. A detailed description of response to steroid injection was documented and photographs were taken. Demographic data were collected on 65 patients (11 to 74 years with mean age 34.7 years, 60 % were females, 50 % were Caucasian). 77 % (n = 50) were classified as steroid responders and showed improvement in symptoms and signs within 3 months. There was a statistically significant correlation between patients with higher contour scores of KD prior to treatment (p = 0.013) and frequency of injections (p = 0.003). Thus, the odds of being a responder were greater for patients with more than one injection and with higher contour scores. This preliminary case series has provided early evidence in enabling identification of steroid responders versus non-responders within a 3-month period. Selection of KD non-responders to steroid treatment can avoid potentially painful injection, its subsequent side effects and unnecessary continuation of redundant therapy and follow-up.

A Conceptual Analysis of Environmental Justice Approaches: Procedural Environmental Justice in the EIA Process in South Africa and Zambia
The Abstract of thesis submitted to the School of Law of The University of Manchester by Pamela Towela Sambo 7160514 for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in April 2012 is entitled “A Conceptual Analysis of Environmental Justice Approaches: Procedural Environmental Justice in the EIA Process in South Africa and Zambia.”This study argues that the basis of all environmental justice variations is the consideration of fairness, equity and justice in the environmental processes that resolve environmental problems. A Procedural Environmental Justice Model (PEJM) has been developed for the purpose of evaluating the procedural environmental justice content of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) legislation in South Africa and Zambia. EIA as a tool for mitigating adverse environmental impacts arising from development activities aims at identifying, predicting, evaluating and mitigating the bio-physical, social, and other relevant effects of development proposals prior to major decisions being taken. This makes it an apt case study for evaluating how procedural environmental justice works. The PEJM developed in this thesis is important because it can be used as a mechanism for evaluating how procedural environmental justice works in practice. Apart from developing the PEJM, this research provides an in- depth evaluation of procedural environmental justice and proceeds, in a novel manner, to focus on South Africa and Zambia. The concept of environmental justice originates from the civil liberties campaigns of the 1960s and the more recent Environmental Justice Movement in the United States. It was historically concerned with widespread distributive inequalities which manifested as discrimination mainly on the basis of race and economic status in environmental matters. In more recent years, environmental justice concerns have become more profound owing to the diversity and gravity of global environmental problems such as global warming and climate change, natural resources depletion and widespread air and water pollution. The effects of these global environmental problems have been predicted to affect inhabitants of developing countries more than those of the developed ones, thereby emphasising procedural environmental justice concerns.This research shows that in the present day environmental parlance, environmental justice should be increasingly used to connote inclusiveness in addressing global, national and grassroots environmental problems. There has been a distinct tendency to move beyond the traditional description of environmental justice as being distributive, or primarily concerned with the allocation of environmental advantages and disadvantages. This is due to the realisation that distributive environmental justice aspects are inadequate in addressing historical and present day environmental challenges. This research emphasises that environmental justice incorporates procedural, corrective and social aspects of justice. The promotion of inclusive participation or procedural environmental justice transcends all conceptions of the concept. Therefore, in order to promote environmental justice, environmental legislation must focus on procedural features that incorporate effective public participation mechanisms.

The role of magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment of suspected extrinsic tracheobronchial compression due to vascular anomalies.
AIMS: To evaluate the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the assessment of children with suspected extrinsic tracheobronchial compression due to vascular anomalies. METHODS: Retrospective case note review in a tertiary referral centre. Twenty nine children who underwent dynamic laryngotracheobronchoscopy (DLTB) and were found to have a clinical suspicion of extrinsic tracheobronchial compression were evaluated. All subsequently underwent thoracic MRI within 10 days. The findings on endoscopy were compared to those of MRI, and where performed, echocardiography, aortography, and surgery. RESULTS: There were 17 males and 12 females (mean age 5 months, range 28 weeks gestation to 60 months). The most common presenting features were stridor and cyanotic episodes. MRI showed abnormalities in 21 patients. There were five vascular rings (three double aortic arches and two right aortic arches) and 11 cases of innominate artery compression. Other vascular anomalies noted included aberrant right subclavian artery and aneurysmal left pulmonary artery. Echocardiography was generally found to be unhelpful in the diagnosis of extra-cardiac vascular abnormalities. Angiography was subsequently conducted in eight children; findings agreed with those shown on MRI. Surgery was performed on all five vascular rings, one innominate artery compression, and one aneurysmal left pulmonary artery. Surgical findings were also compatible with the preoperative MRI. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the successful use of MRI as the initial imaging modality in endoscopically suspected extrinsic vascular compression of the upper airway. It enables accurate delineation of vascular anomalies and, unlike aortography, is non-invasive and does not require the use of contrast media.

CD154 plays a central role in regulating dendritic cell activation during infections that induce Th1 or Th2 responses.
We compared splenic DC activation during infection with either the Th2 response-inducing parasite Schistosoma mansoni or with the Th1 response-inducing parasite Toxoplasma gondii. CD8alpha(+) DC from schistosome-infected mice exhibited a 2- to 3-fold increase in the expression of MHC class II, CD80, and CD40 (but not CD86) compared with DC from uninfected control animals, while CD8alpha(-) DC exhibited a 2- to 3-fold increase in the expression of MHC class II and CD80 and no alteration, compared with DC from uninfected mice, in the expression of CD86 or CD40. Intracellular staining revealed that DC did not produce IL-12 during infection with S. mansoni. In contrast, infection with T. gondii resulted in a more pronounced increase in the expression of activation-associated molecules (MHC class II, CD80, CD86, and CD40) on both CD8alpha(-) and CD8alpha(+) splenic DC and promoted elevated IL-12 production by DC. Analysis of MHC class I and of additional costimulatory molecules (ICOSL, ICAM-1, OX40L, 4-1BBL, and B7-DC) revealed a generally similar pattern, with greater indication of activation in T. gondii-infected mice compared with S. mansoni-infected animals. Strikingly, the activation of DC observed during infection with either parasite was not apparent in DC from infected CD154(-/-) mice, indicating that CD40/CD154 interactions are essential for maintaining DC activation during infection regardless of whether the outcome is a Th1 or a Th2 response. However, the ability of this activation pathway to induce IL-12 production by DC is restrained in S. mansoni-infected, but not T. gondii-infected, mice by Ag-responsive CD11c(-) cells.

Authigenic uranium in foraminiferal coatings : a proxy for ocean redox chemistry
The rate of uranium accumulation in oceanic sediments from seawater is controlled by bottom water oxygen concentrations and organic carbon fluxes—two parameters that are linked to deep ocean storage of CO2. To investigate glacial-interglacial changes in what is known as authigenic U, we have developed a rapid method for its determination as a simple addition to a procedure for foraminiferal trace element analysis. Foraminiferal calcite acts as a low U substrate (U/Ca < 15 nmol/mol) upon which authigenic U accumulates in reducing sediments. We measured a downcore record of foraminiferal U/Ca from ODP Site 1090 in the South Atlantic and found that U/Ca ratios increase by 70–320 nmol/mol during glacial intervals. There is a significant correlation between U/Ca records of benthic and planktonic foraminiferal species and between U/Ca and bulk sediment authigenic U. These results indicate that elevated U/Ca ratios are attributable to the accumulation of authigenic U coatings in sediments. Foraminiferal Mn/Ca ratios were lower during the glacial intervals, suggesting that the observed U accumulation on the shells is not directly linked to U incorporation into secondary manganese phases. Thus, foraminiferal U/Ca ratios may provide useful information on past changes in sediment redox conditions.Author Posting. © American Geophysical Union, 2012.

[light, photoreceptor, retinal, clock, response, melanopsin, iprgc]

How rod, cone, and melanopsin photoreceptors come together to enlighten the mammalian circadian clock.
In mammals, a small number of retinal ganglion cells express melanopsin, an opsin photopigment, allowing them to be directly photoreceptive. A major function of these so-called intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) is to synchronize (entrain) endogenous circadian clocks to the external light:dark cycle. Thanks to their intrinsic light response, ipRGCs can support photoentrainment even when the other retinal photoreceptors (rods and cones) are absent or inactive. However, in the intact retina the ipRGC light response is a composite of extrinsic (rod/cone) and intrinsic (melanopsin) influences. As a result all three photoreceptor classes contribute to the retinal pathways providing light information to the clock. Here, we consider what each photoreceptor type contributes to the clock light response. We review electrophysiological and behavioral data pertinent to this question, primarily from laboratory rodents, drawing them together to provide a conceptual model in which each photoreceptor class plays a distinct role in encoding the light environment. We finally use this model to highlight some of the important outstanding questions in this field.

Fibroblasts from the growing margin of keloid scars produce higher levels of collagen I and III compared with intralesional and extralesional sites: clinical implications for lesional site-directed therapy.
BACKGROUND: Overproduction of collagen and its abnormal assembly are hallmarks of keloid scars. Type I/III collagen ratios are altered in keloids compared with normal skin. Fibroblasts from different sites in keloid tissue, perilesional compared with intralesional and extralesional sites, show differential apoptosis and contraction. Additionally, early vs. later cell culture passages display differential collagen expression. We therefore hypothesize that keloid fibroblasts from the growing margin of the keloid express higher levels of collagen type I and III, and that collagen production is altered by extended cell culture passage. OBJECTIVES: (i) To measure collagen I and III at mRNA and protein levels quantitatively in keloid fibroblasts, growth media and tissue sections; and (ii) to perform tissue staining for collagen I and III expression in different lesional sites. METHODS: Keloid fibroblast cultures from intralesional, perilesional and extralesional sites (n = 8 separate keloid cases, yielding 64 biopsy samples) were established from passage 0 to passage 3. Collagen I and III mRNA was quantified using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We also measured the protein levels quantitatively by developing a highly specific and sensitive capture sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A novel in-cell Western blotting was carried out in addition to haematoxylin and eosin and Herovici staining on keloid tissue sections for collagen I and III. RESULTS: Collagen types I and III were significantly higher (P < 0·03) in fibroblasts from the growing margin (perilesional site) compared with extralesional and intralesional keloid biopsy sites. As the passage number increased, the amount of collagen I significantly (P < 0·05) decreased and the collagen I/III ratio also decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that cells from the growing margin of keloid scars have a higher production of collagen I and III compared with other lesional sites. Additionally, temporal extension of cell passage affects collagen production. Clinically these findings may influence selection and interpretation of extended cell passage and provide future direction for lesional site-specific therapy in keloid scars.

Quantification of coral heat shock proteins from individual coral polyps
The induction and regulation of heat shock proteins (hsps) is a significant defense mechanism that can preserve metabolic function and foster recovery from short-term stress events. Present coral sampling methodologies that involve hsp analysis often require the harvesting of large samples of live coral colonies that may already be stressed or in poor health. In the present study, 3 novel protocols were developed to: (1) extract single coral polyps, minimizing colony trauma; (2) purify protein from single coral polyps (approximately 12 mm3); and (3) develop a more sensitive protein quantification method. The preliminary testing of 5 separate protein preparation methods resulted in a range of total protein yields from 47 to 77 µg coral polyp–1. The optimized methods were able to recover, on average, 44 ± 12 µg protein polyp–1 (n = 20). Subsequent SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis of single coral polyps resolved as little as 87 pg hsp70 coral polyp–1. This minimally invasive sampling protocol reduces coral damage and, thus, reduces stress and diseases caused by sampling.Author Posting. © Inter-Research, 2009.

The aim of this studyis the investigation of the sorption competition between some divalent and trivalent metal ions(Ni2+, Co2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Cr3+ and Eu3+) onto montmorillonite. The parameters that haveconsidered are contact time, pH, metal ion concentration and adsorbent amount.The study shows that no effect oftime on the uptake of divalent and trivalentmetal ions uptake. The Cr3+ and Eu3+ ionshave the same sorption (100%)throughout the experiment (20 min - 2days). The divalent metal ions give lesssorption: Zn2+ (64%) > Ni2+  2+(55%) > Cd2+ (43%). The effect of pH wasstudied in the presence and in the absenceof humic acid and the uptake was found tobe increase with increasing the pH from 2to 7 2. Again the trivalent metal ionsgave higher uptake than that for thedivalent ions.Increasing the metal ion concentration (2-10 mg.L-1) resulted in a decrease in thesorption affinity (Kd) for the divalent metal ions, whilst it was constant for Eu3+ and Cr3+ inthe presence and absence of humic acid. The uptake of the divalent metal ions increases as theadsorbent amount increases in the presence of humic acid, whilst there is no effect on thesorption of the trivalent ions. In the absence of humic acid, the uptake of both trivalent anddivalent metal ions decreases with increasing adsorbent amount. The concentration isothermresults showed that the binding strength follows the order: Eu3+ > Cr3+ 2+ > Zn2+

Knowledge extraction from neural networks
<p>In the past, neural networks have been viewed as classification and regression systems whose internal representations were incomprehensible. It is now becoming apparent that algorithms can be designed which extract comprehensible representations from trained neural networks, enabling them to be used for data mining, i.e. the discovery and explanation of previously unknown relationships present in data. This paper reviews existing algorithms for extracting comprehensible representations from neural networks and describes research to generalize and extend the capabilities of one of these algorithms. The algorithm has been generalized for application to bioinformatics datasets, including the prediction of splice site junctions in human DNA sequences. Results generated on this dataset are compared with those generated by a conventional data mining technique (C5), and conclusions are drawn regarding the application of the neural network based technique to other fields of interest.</p>

Dissociative disorders in DSM-5
Background: We present recommendations for revision of the diagnostic criteria for the Dissociative Disorders (DDs) for DSM-5. The periodic revision of the DSM provides an opportunity to revisit the assumptions underlying specific diagnoses and the empirical support, or lack of it, for the defining diagnostic criteria. Methods: This paper reviews clinical, phenomenological, epidemiological,cultural, and neurobiological data related to the DDs in order to generate an up-to-date, evidence-based set of DD diagnoses and diagnostic criteria for DSM-5. First, we review the definitions of dissociation and the differences between the definitions of dissociation and conceptualization of DDs in the DSM-IV-TR and the ICD-10, respectively. Also, we review more general conceptual issues in defining dissociation and dissociative disorders. Based on this review, we propose a revised definition of dissociation for DSM-5 and discuss the implications of this definition for understanding dissociative symptoms and disorders. Results: We make the following recommendations for DSM-5: 1. Depersonalization Disorder (DPD) should derealization symptoms as well. 2. Dissociative Fugue should become a subtype of Dissociative Amnesia (DA). 3. The diagnostic criteria for DID should be changed to emphasize the disruptive nature of the dissociation and amnesia for everyday as well as traumatic events. The experience of possession should be included in the definition of identity disruption. 4. Should Dissociative Trance Disorder should be included in the Unspecified Dissociative Disorder (UDD) category. Conclusions: There is a growing body of evidence linking the dissociative disorders to a trauma history, and to specific neural mechanisms.

[opsin, optogenetic, jellyop, tool, rod, light]

Reproducible and sustained regulation of Gαs signalling using a metazoan opsin as an optogenetic tool.
Originally developed to regulate neuronal excitability, optogenetics is increasingly also used to control other cellular processes with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. Optogenetic modulation of all major G-protein signalling pathways (Gq, Gi and Gs) has been achieved using variants of mammalian rod opsin. We show here that the light response driven by such rod opsin-based tools dissipates under repeated exposure, consistent with the known bleaching characteristics of this photopigment. We continue to show that replacing rod opsin with a bleach resistant opsin from Carybdea rastonii, the box jellyfish, (JellyOp) overcomes this limitation. Visible light induced high amplitude, reversible, and reproducible increases in cAMP in mammalian cells expressing JellyOp. While single flashes produced a brief cAMP spike, repeated stimulation could sustain elevated levels for 10s of minutes. JellyOp was more photosensitive than currently available optogenetic tools, responding to white light at irradiances ≥1 µW/cm(2). We conclude that JellyOp is a promising new tool for mimicking the activity of Gs-coupled G protein coupled receptors with fine spatiotemporal resolution.

Second Generation Antipsychotics improve Sexual Dysfunction in Schizophrenia: a Randomised Controlled Trial
The impact of antipsychotic drug treatment on sexual function was investigated during a randomised trial comparing first generation antipsychotics (FGAs) to (nonclozapine) second generation antipsychotics (SGAs). Sexual function and quality of life were (rater-blind) assessed in 42 patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia (aged 18–65) using the self-report version of the Derogatis Interview for Sexual Function (DISF-SR) and the Heinrichs Quality of Life Scale (QLS), prior to, and 12 weeks following, a change in medication from an FGA drug to either an FGA or SGA drug. SGAs significantly improved sexual function compared to FGAs.Change in sexual function was associated with change in quality of life.Where impaired sexual functioning is a distressing adverse effect of treatment with an FGA agent, consideration should be given to switching to an SGA.

Inhibition of T1/ST2 during respiratory syncytial virus infection prevents T helper cell type 2 (Th2)- but not Th1-driven immunopathology.
T cells secreting interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5 (T helper cell type 2 Th2 cells) play a detrimental role in a variety of diseases, but specific methods of regulating their activity remain elusive. T1/ST2 is a surface ligand of the IL-1 receptor family, expressed on Th2- but not on interferon (IFN)-gamma-producing Th1 cells. Prior exposure of BALB/c mice to the attachment (G) or fusion (F) protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) increases illness severity during intranasal RSV challenge, due to Th2-driven lung eosinophilia and exuberant Th1-driven pulmonary infiltration, respectively. We used these polar models of viral illness to study the recruitment of T1/ST2 cells to the lung and to test the effects of anti-T1/ST2 treatment in vivo. T1/ST2 was present on a subset of CD4(+) cells from mice with eosinophilic lung disease. Monoclonal anti-T1/ST2 treatment reduced lung inflammation and the severity of illness in mice with Th2 (but not Th1) immunopathology. These results show that inhibition of T1/ST2 has a specific effect on virally induced Th2 responses and suggests that therapy targeted at this receptor might be of value in treating Th2-driven illness.

Minimal Radiative Neutrino Mass Mechanism for Inverse Seesaw Models
We study a minimal one-loop radiative mechanism for generating small Majorana neutrino masses in inverse seesaw extensions of the Standard Model with two singlet fermions per family. The new feature of this radiative mechanism is that the one-loop induced left-handed neutrino mass matrix is directly proportional to the Majorana mass matrix of the right-handed neutrinos. This is a very economical scenario without necessitating the existence of non-standard scalar or gauge fields.

Effect of hyperventilation on distal colonic motility and rectal sensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome.
Hyperventilation is associated with some symptoms suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome and has been implicated in provoking excessive oesophageal contractility. Sixteen patients with irritable bowel syndrome were therefore studied in order to assess the effect of hyperventilation on distal colonic motility and rectal sensitivity. No significant change in either the amplitude or frequency of colonic contractile activity was noted following hyperventilation, nor was any alteration in rectal sensitivity observed. This study shows that acute hyperventilation does not affect colonic motor activity or visceral sensitivity and suggests that hyperventilation and irritable bowel syndrome are not causally related.

Site-bond modelling of porous quasi-brittle media
Geological repositories' designs employ a multi-barrier approach.  The materials, which include wasteforms, backfill, and host rock, are typically porous quasi-brittle.  Mechanical damage, e.g. nucleation and growth of microcracks, can result in significant changes in permeability.  A knowledge of how the permeability is affected is critical to accurate modelling of radionuclide transport.  This work proposes a novel 3D lattice-type model for the damage evolution in such materials, referred to as the site-bond model.  Its advantages over previous models are that the shape of the lattice cell is physically realistic and that any macroscopic elastic response can be represented, including those of cementitious and geological materials.  Damage accumulates as bonds fail upon reaching prescribed failure strengths.  These are dictated by a predefined pore size distribution.  Concrete is used as a study material.  It is demonstrated that the model can predict the macroscopic stress-strain response under unconfined tension and compression with emergent non-linearity due to damage evolution.  Ongoing work on the prediction of permeability changes with damage is discussed.  This is based on the interaction between the model proposed here and a lattice model of the pore space.

Evaluation of a new disposable "tampon like" electrostimulation technology (Pelviva®) for the treatment of urinary incontinence in women: A 12-week single blind randomized controlled trial.
AIMS: To test the null hypothesis that a novel disposable "tampon like" electrostimulation device (Pelviva®) is no better than unsupervised pelvic floor muscle exercise for treatment of urinary incontinence in women. METHODS: Pre/post-intervention assessor blinded, single center RCT. A total of 123 community dwelling self referred women with symptoms of stress, urge, or mixed incontinence were randomly assigned to one of two 12-week duration treatments: Pelviva® used for 30 min a day plus unsupervised pelvic floor muscle exercise or unsupervised exercises alone. Outcome measures included ICIQ-UI (primary), ICIQ FLUTSex and global impression of severity and improvement (secondary) completed at recruitment, after 4 weeks of unsupervised exercise and immediately post-treatment. Diary of exercise frequency/type, overall impression, and usage of device was completed mid- and post-treatment. RESULTS: Pelviva® plus exercise produced significantly better outcome than unsupervised exercise alone: 5 points (45%) versus 1 point (10%) for ICIQ-UI (P = 0.014); 67% versus 33% for leak frequency (P = 0.005); 40% versus 20% for leak interference with life (P = 0.018). Incontinence was less bothersome during sex to a greater extent in the Pelviva® group (P = 0.026). Women were enthusiastic about the device, found it comfortable/easy to use and experienced no adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The Pelviva® device plus unsupervised exercise is more successful than unsupervised pelvic floor muscle exercise alone in treating urinary incontinence. The device is easy/comfortable to use, there are no apparent adverse incidents, and women can manage their incontinence in the privacy of their own home. The product will be launched 2013. Neurourol.

Investigation of 2D and 3D electrospun scaffolds intended for tendon repair.
Two-dimensional (2D) electrospun fibre mats have been investigated as fibrous sheets intended as biomaterials scaffolds for tissue repair. It is recognised that tissues are three-dimensional (3D) structures and that optimisation of the fabrication process should include both 2D and 3D scaffolds. Understanding the relative merits of the architecture of 2D and 3D scaffolds for tendon repair is required. This study investigated three different electrospun scaffolds based on poly(ε-caprolactone) fibres intended for repair of injured tendons, referred to as; 2D random sheet, 2D aligned sheet and 3D bundles. 2D aligned fibres and 3D bundles mimicked the parallel arrangement of collagen fibres in natural tendon and 3D bundles further replicated the tertiary layer of a tendon's hierarchical configuration. 3D bundles demonstrated greatest tensile properties, being significantly stronger and stiffer than 2D aligned and 2D random fibres. All scaffolds supported adhesion and proliferation of tendon fibroblasts. Furthermore, 2D aligned sheets and 3D bundles allowed guidance of the cells into a parallel, longitudinal arrangement, which is similar to tendon cells in the native tissue. With their superior physical properties and ability to better replicate tendon tissue, the 3D electrospun scaffolds warrant greater investigation as synthetic grafts in tendon repair.

Enabling Visualization of Massive Datasets Through MPP Database Architecture
We are developing a novel visualization architecture which is specifically designed to render very large (terabyte scale) datasets. Our method differs from the classic visualization pipeline of Harber and McNabb. In particular we eliminate the need to create geometric objects, for example surfaces composed of polygons, as a stage before rendering. Such objects require specialist HPC servers for their creation and manipulation; our solution eliminates the need for such servers. We replace the geometric objects by structures stored and tagged in a database next to the original dataset; we call these Spatially Registered Data Structures (SRDS). Such structures are linked to a single rendering pipeline through the on-the-fly creation of a Feature Embedded Spatial Volume (FESVo). This solution exploits recently developed capabilities of in-database Massive Parallel Processing (MPP) and parallel data streaming, together with the rapidly developing capabilities of GPUs. We describe an early prototype of an architecture applied to seismic data from the oil and gas industry.

Erectile dysfunction after open versus angioplasty aortoiliac procedures: a questionnaire survey.
Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common complication after aortoiliac surgery. The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of ED in patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease or aneurysm and evaluate the effect of revascularization by means of open surgery or iliac angioplasty/stenting upon erectile function by using the new International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire. All male patients who had previously undergone open aortoiliac reconstruction or iliac angioplasty/stenting and who were alive at the time of this study were first contacted by telephone. Those who agreed to take part in the study were sent anonymous IIEF questionnaires. Patients were asked to recall their sexual function before and 3 months after the procedure. ED was defined as IIEF score of <11. After telephone interview, a total of 116 patients agreed to take part in the study. The response rate was 61%. Two patients, one in each group, had ED preoperatively. The preoperative IIEF scores were no different in surgery and angioplasty/stenting groups (p=0.3). Overall, 46/63 patients reported worsening erectile function postoperatively. In the surgery group (n=37), 32 patients reported deterioration of their sexual function, 3 no change, and 2 improvement, while in the angioplasty/stenting group (n=26), 14 patients had deterioration, 11 no change, and 1 improvement. In both groups, the IIEF score decreased significantly postintervention; however, the deterioration was much more pronounced after open surgery (p<0.001). Of the 61 patients with "normal" erectile function (IIEF > or =11), 10 patients (28%) developed ED following surgery, but none after angioplasty/stenting (p=0.003). As judged by the IIEF, a significant proportion of patients undergoing open and endovascular procedures experience worsening sexual function.

Larval dispersal between hydrothermal vent habitats
Hydrothermal vents are isolated, short-term habitats that support unique biotic
assemblages with relatively high biomass utilizing an unusual energy source. How these
communities establish themselves and maintain species identity despite their isolation
and impermanence is a significant question in vent ecology. Planktonic larval forms
provide a dispersive life stage for many species, but the exact mechanism and controls of
dispersal are unknown.
A description of larval distribution patterns, for which reliable identification of
vent larvae is necessary, is critical to understanding larval dispersal. In gastropod
species, the retention of the larval shell on the adult allows identification without the
necessity of culturing larvae or using species-specific molecular probes, both techniques
that are still difficult with vent organisms. At one site (9°N, East Pacific Rise), eleven
species of vent gastropod larvae were identified from the water column up to 200 m off
the seafloor. The species-specific level of these identifications is important, as there may
be species-level differences in species distributions that influence dispersal.
Finding vent larvae high in the water column above the source populations
suggests that some mechanism must exist to raise larvae off the sea floor. Literature on
related species indicates that larval behaviors such as swimming or buoyancy control
could not be responsible for such significant vertical movement over a reasonable time
period. Passive movement via entrainment into buoyant plumes rising from smoker vents
provides a pathway for larvae to get high above the bottom, and has implications for
larval dispersal because vertical shear in flows above vents can cause trajectories in the
plume to deviate considerably from those along the seafloor. The distance that vent
communities extend around smokers is limited, so 28-97% of the larvae produced may be
entrained into the rising plume. Buoyant plumes have the potential to transport a
substantial proportion of the larvae produced by hydrothermal vent communities.
Larvae may follow several different paths in dispersing between vents. Near-bottom
flows tend to be topographically constrained to parallel the ridge crest, and
advection in near-bottom currents is one potential larval dispersal mechanism.
Entrainment into a buoyant plume and lateral advection hundreds of meters above the sea
floor is a feasible alternative or additional dispersal mechanism. However, in deep-sea
habitats it is difficult to directly test these hypotheses. Ecological modeling offers an
alternative to experimental approaches to hypothesis testing. By creating a realistic
model simulation, insight can be gained into which factors: vent spacing and instability
(geological); flow regime (physical); or fecundity, larval mortality, and adult maturation
time (biological), most strongly influence the patterns of species distributions along mid-ocean
ridges. The results of model simulations suggest"that long distance dispersal (as
might be provided by plume flow) is vital to long-term persistence of vent populations,
and that fecundity and larval mortality interact with habitat spacing and vent lifespan to
influence the stability of the overall population.
Larval transport, establishment of vent communities and specie$ persistence are
key factors in hydrothermal vent ecology. This thesis examines the potential for larval
dispersal and species survival under various flow regimes, and identifies and observes the
distribution of vent larvae in the water column. Its significance lies in the potential to
further understanding of endemic species dispersal in a patchy, ephemeral habitat.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution January 199

A multi-parametric flow cytometric assay to analyze DNA–protein interactions
Interactions between DNA and transcription factors (TFs) guide cellular function and development, yet the complexities of gene regulation are still far from being understood. Such understanding is limited by a paucity of techniques with which to probe DNA–protein interactions. We have devised magnetic protein immobilization on enhancer DNA (MagPIE), a simple, rapid, multi-parametric assay using flow cytometric immunofluorescence to reveal interactions among TFs, chromatin structure and DNA. In MagPIE, synthesized DNA is bound to magnetic beads, which are then incubated with nuclear lysate, permitting sequence-specific binding by TFs, histones and methylation by native lysate factors that can be optionally inhibited with small molecules. Lysate protein–DNA binding is monitored by flow cytometric immunofluorescence, which allows for accurate comparative measurement of TF-DNA affinity. Combinatorial fluorescent staining allows simultaneous analysis of sequence-specific TF-DNA interaction and chromatin modification. MagPIE provides a simple and robust method to analyze complex epigenetic interactions in vitro.

Quasi-resonances in sound-insulating coatings
This paper is concerned with the radiation of sound waves from a submerged cylindrical body which is coated by an imperfect elastic layer; that is, the coating only covers part of the cylinder. The focus of the study is to quantify the effect of the gap in the elastic layer on the radiated acoustic power. A finite element method is employed to determine the acoustic pressure field in the fluid and the displacement field in the coupled layer. This reveals that the effect of a modest sized gap in the coating does not markedly alter the radiated field except at distinct frequencies, at which values the coating exhibits strong fluid-coupled oscillations. We develop a simple analytical model to explain the resonance phenomenon and show that quasi-resonances arise when the wavelength of the deformation pattern 'matches' the azimuthal length of the surface of the coating. This resonant behaviour is conveniently captured by a single parameter Q, which is the ratio of the typical inertial fluid pressure induced by the wall oscillation to the stiffness of the elastic coating. For each choice of material parameters, there is shown to be an infinite set of values of Q corresponding to distinct quasi-resonance mode numbers. The effects on the radiated field due to variations in various physical parameters, such as acoustic wavenumber and elastic layer inertia, are also discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Angina-like chest pain: a joint medical and psychiatric investigation.
Sixty three patients with chest pain typical of angina and who had normal coronary angiograms were investigated for left ventricular, oesophageal and psychiatric abnormalities. An additional 21 patients, age and sex matched, who had angina and significant coronary artery disease were also studied. Eighty six per cent of the 63 patients without evidence of coronary artery disease could be demonstrated to have a physical abnormality (left ventricular dysfunction in 35%, oesophageal disorder 51%). There was, however, a wide variation in the incidence of psychiatric morbidity between the diagnostic subgroups-18% in left ventricular dysfunction, 29% in those with coronary artery disease and 59% in patients with oesophageal disorders (P less than 0.01). Thus failure to identify left ventricular dysfunction and inclusion of such subjects in psychological assessments of 'angiogram-negative' chest pain might give misleading results. This study confirms that patients with angina and normal coronary angiography have a high incidence of oesophageal disorders. However psychiatric illness is also common in this group of subjects and management needs to take both these factors into account.

Investigation of the damage imparted to human hair through semi-permanent thermal straightening using synergistic FTIR-techniques
Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) techniques are widely used to investigate the chemical composition of hair and textile fibres.  Absorption spectra can be used measure physical and chemical changes in fibre lipids and fibre proteins.  In the present study we investigate the effects of two semi-permanent hair straighteners, and of thermal straightening, on hair using both ATR-FTIR and transmission-FTIR. The ATR-FTIR was used to measure changes in cysteic acid levels at the cuticle surface.  In contrast, transmission-FTIR was employed to investigate changes in cysteic acid throughout the whole cross-section of the hair.  Since the hair cortex makes-up ca. 85% of the fibre structure, we assumed that changes seen with transmission-FTIR are mostly linked to cortex effects.
The FTIR spectra were recorded using a Nicolet 5700 FTIR spectrometer. The spectra were collected within the range of 4000 to 400 cm-1, using a 64 scan rate. All spectra were normalised using the CH2 vibration (~1450 cm-1); this vibration is common to all spectra and shows a stable wave number. A second derivative analysis was then performed on each absorption spectrum in order to define the position of hidden peaks.  Arithmetic means of the cysteic acid minima from the second derivative curves were then used to compare the relative amounts of cysteic acid in each hair sample. For a quantitative comparison between ATR- and transmission- spectra, it was important to apply an ATR-correction factor to the ATR spectra. This took into account the different penetration depths of the infrared beam.
ATR-FITR measurements showed overall significantly raised levels of cysteic acid in the cuticle surface after chemical and thermal treatments in comparison to transmission-FTIR. Both methods allow us to see changes in the overall fibre chemical structure. 

This study has found that ATR-FTIR and transmission- FTIR can distinguish between cortex and cuticle changes. The synergism of the two methods allows us to differentiate the effects of various straightening treatments on each of these structures.

Excited structures in the proton-rich nucleus 140Dy were established following the decay of a 7.3+-1.5 ms, Kv = 8- isomer.  The isomer decays into the yrast line at the 8+ state, revealing a rotational band with a deduced deformation of b2 = 0.24(3).  The isotope 140Dy is the daughter of the deformed proton emitter 141Ho.  The new information obtained here supports the role of deformation in proton emission and the previous assignments of single-particle configurations to the two proton emitting states in 141Ho.  In addn., the reduced hindrance factor measured for the isomer is consistent with the trend obsd. in the N = 74 isotones and shows no deviation which could be attributed to the proximity of 140Dy to the proton drip line. on SciFinder (R)

Metabolic modeling and analysis of the metabolic switch in Streptomyces coelicolor
Background: The transition from exponential to stationary phase in Streptomyces coelicolor is accompanied by a major metabolic switch and results in a strong activation of secondary metabolism. Here we have explored the underlying reorganization of the metabolome by combining computational predictions based on constraint-based modeling and detailed transcriptomics time course observations.Results: We reconstructed the stoichiometric matrix of S. coelicolor, including the major antibiotic biosynthesis pathways, and performed flux balance analysis to predict flux changes that occur when the cell switches from biomass to antibiotic production. We defined the model input based on observed fermenter culture data and used a dynamically varying objective function to represent the metabolic switch. The predicted fluxes of many genes show highly significant correlation to the time series of the corresponding gene expression data. Individual mispredictions identify novel links between antibiotic production and primary metabolism.Conclusion: Our results show the usefulness of constraint-based modeling for providing a detailed interpretation of time course gene expression data. ?? 2010 Alam et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Mapping the differential distribution of proteoglycan core proteins in the adult human retina, choroid, and sclera.
PURPOSE: To examine the presence and distribution of proteoglycan (PG) core proteins in the adult human retina, choroid, and sclera. METHODS: Postmortem human eye tissue was dissected into Bruch's membrane/choroid complex, isolated Bruch's membrane, or neurosensory retina. PGs were extracted and partially purified by anion exchange chromatography. Trypsinized peptides were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry and PG core proteins identified by database search. The distribution of PGs was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy on human macular tissue sections. RESULTS: The basement membrane PGs perlecan, agrin, and collagen-XVIII were identified in the human retina, and were present in the internal limiting membrane, blood vessel walls, and Bruch's membrane. The hyalectans versican and aggrecan were also detected. Versican was identified in Bruch's membrane, while aggrecan was distributed throughout the retina, choroid, and sclera. The cartilage link protein HAPLN1 was abundant in the interphotoreceptor matrix and sclera, while HAPLN4 (brain link protein 2) was found throughout the retina and choroid. The small leucine-rich repeat PG (SLRP) family members biglycan, decorin, fibromodulin, lumican, mimecan, opticin, and prolargin were present, with different patterns of distribution in the retina, choroid, and sclera. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of proteomics and immunohistochemistry approaches has provided for the first time a comprehensive analysis of the presence and distribution of PG core proteins throughout the human retina, choroid, and sclera. This complements our knowledge of glycosaminoglycan chain distribution in the human eye, and has important implications for understanding the structure and functional regulation of the eye in health and disease.

Perception of quality of care: Comparison of the views of patients’ with lung cancer and their family member.
Aims and objectives.  To explore potential differences within dyads of patients’ with lung cancer and family members’ judgment of different aspects of quality of care and relationships between quality of care and personal and health-related characteristics.Background.  High quality of care is important for acceptable quality of life in patients in palliative care. If patients are unable to participate in quality of care assessments or decision-making, family members might often act as proxies, despite the complicated nature of their own situation.Design.  Cross-sectional survey design.Method.  A patient and family member version of the abbreviated questionnaire Quality from Patients’ Perspective, with additional items about perceived health and opinions about care, was mailed to members of the Swedish lung cancer Patient Organisation. Wilcoxon’s signed rank test was used to identify potential differences within 51 patient–family member dyads’ quality of care ratings. Relationships between Quality from Patients’ Perspective dimensions and demographic and health-related variables were examined with Spearman’s correlations.Results.  Patient–family member dyads had high levels of agreement in ratings of perceived reality of quality of care. Family members generally rated the subjective importance of individual items higher than did the patient in the dyad, with significant difference in the dimension ‘socio-cultural approach’. Older patients were found to rate the physical–technical conditions higher than younger patients, in relation to perceived reality but not subjective importance. Women family members were found to rate the subjective importance of medical–technical competence, identity-oriented approach and socio-cultural approach significantly higher than men did.Conclusions.  Patients with lung cancer and their family members agree in ratings of the perceived reality, but they differ more in ratings of the subjective importance of quality of care. When patients are unable to communicate their preferences, family members’ opinions could be used as proxies concerning concrete aspects of quality of care. Concerning more subjective aspects, family members’ ratings should be interpreted with precaution, as it could diverge from patients’ own opinion.Relevance to clinical practice.  The perceptions of the importance of different aspects of quality of care were less related to health status than were judgments of quality of care received. This might suggest that the care patients received fulfilled neither the patients’ nor family members’ expectations, which is an important message to healthcare professionals and which would demand further exploration.

Mn-doped Ga(As,P) and (Al,Ga)As ferromagnetic semiconductors: Electronic structure calculations
A remarkable progress towards functional ferromagnetic semiconductor materials for spintronics has been achieved in p-type (Ga,Mn)As. Robust hole-mediated ferromagnetism has, however, been observed also in other III-V hosts such as antimonides, GaP, or (Al,Ga)As, which opens a wide area of possibilities for optimizing the host composition towards higher ferromagnetic Curie temperatures. Here we explore theoretically hole-mediated ferromagnetism and Mn incorporation in Ga(As,P) and (Al,Ga)As ternary hosts. While alloying (Ga,Mn)As with Al has only a small effect on the Curie temperature we predict a sizable enhancement of Curie temperatures in the smaller lattice constant Ga(As,P) hosts. Mn-doped Ga(As,P) is also favorable, as compared to (Al,Ga)As, with respect to the formation of carrier and moment compensating interstitial Mn impurities. In (Ga,Mn) (As,P) we find a marked decrease of the partial concentration of these detrimental impurities with increasing P content.

Gas hydrate pingoes: Deep seafloor evidence of focused fluid flow on continental margins
Gas hydrates in the shallow subsurface form one of the largest reservoirs of methane in the global organic carbon cycle. Seafloor seeps and associated features represent the venting points of methane released from the shallow lithosphere to the hydrosphere and atmosphere. Here we document the discovery of seep-related seafloor mounds in the Kwanza Basin, offshore Angola, and employ high-resolution three-dimensional seismic analysis to unravel the subsurface plumbing system and the origin of mounds. Mounds with distinct morphologies and geophysical signatures illustrate different development stages associated with the formation and dissociation of shallow gas hydrate, linked to thermogenic fluid migration along salt diapir flanks draining deeply buried salt minibasins. The mounds are more than an order of magnitude larger than previously described submarine hydrate pingoes, and comparable to hydraulic pingoes commonly found in terrestrial periglacial environments, suggesting hydrate volumes of individual mounds up to 1.1 × 106 m3 (equivalent to 2.0 × 108 m3 of methane gas). The interpretation of seismically well-defined seep-related seafloor mounds brings new insight to the occurrence and development of concentrated near-surface gas hydrate accumulations and their relationship with thermogenic fluid migration and host sediment properties along continental margins.

Carbonate as sputter target material for rapid 14C AMS
This paper describes a technique for measuring the 14C content of carbonate samples by
producing C-ions directly in the negative ion sputter source of an accelerator mass
spectrometer (AMS) system. This direct analysis of carbonate material eliminates the
time and expense of graphite preparation. Powdered carbonate is mixed with titanium
powder, loaded into a target cartridge, and compressed. Beam currents for optimally sized carbonate targets (0.09-0.15 mg C) are typically 10-20% of those produced by
optimally-sized graphite targets (0.5-1 mg C). Modern (>0.8 Fm) samples run by this
method have standard deviations of 0.009 Fm or less, and near-modern samples run as
unknowns agree with values from traditional hydrolysis/graphite to better than 2%.
Targets with as little as 0.06 mg carbonate produce useable ion currents and results, albeit
with increased error and larger blank. In its current state, direct sputtering is best applied
to problems where a large number of analyses with lower precision are required. These
applications could include age surveys of deep-sea corals for determination of historic
population dynamics, to identify samples that would benefit from high precision analysis,
and for growth rate studies of organisms forming carbonate skeletons.Author Posting. © The Author(s), 2012.  This is the author's version of the work.

Nanotopography of graphene
Microscopically clean graphene surfaces are scrutinized via atomic resolution high angle dark field imaging and electron energy loss spectroscopy for presence of adsorbed atoms. Carbon ad-atoms can be observed in dark field images, whereas hydrogen is revealed in electron loss spectra. Spectrum images show the spatial distribution of hydrogen in pristine and deliberately H-dosed graphene; hydrogen is found on all graphene surfaces but the coverage is higher and more uniform in dosed samples. On clean surfaces the energy loss is characteristic of the ground level excitation in atomic hydrogen, whereas a spread in the hydrogen energy levels is found in hydrocarbon deposits. A rippling effect in the graphene sheets is revealed when lattice images are processed using fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques. This contrast effect originates from changes in the bond length projection, due to inclinations of the sheet. It is suggested that point defects - vacancies and ad-atomes - influence the ripple patterns. (C) 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim

[theophylline, serum]

Theophylline prescribing, serum concentrations, and toxicity.
Slow-release theophylline preparations have been prescribed increasingly at the Brompton Hospital, and a serum theophylline assay is requested about once for every ten prescriptions. In a period of eighteen months 1913 such assays were performed, and their influence on management was assessed by retrospective analysis in two groups--113 outpatients on stable dosage with no recent exacerbations of disease; and 28 inpatients and outpatients with concentrations exceeding 25 mg/l. In those with stable treatment, there was only a loose relation between dose and serum theophylline level. High serum levels were associated with abnormal liver function, diuretic use, and duplicate prescribing. When serum theophylline levels were reported high, dosage was always reduced, whereas a low serum theophylline prompted dosage increase in only one-third of patients. Of the patients with very high serum theophylline concentrations (over 25 mg/l), 18 had been receiving oral theophylline and 10 aminophylline by infusion. 3 had seizures, of whom 2 died, and 1 patient was resuscitated after cardiac arrest. Unsuspected theophylline toxicity may be responsible for considerable hidden morbidity.

Trial protocol OPPTIMUM- Does progesterone prophylaxis for the prevention of preterm labour improve outcome?
ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Preterm birth is a global problem, with a prevalence of 8 to 12% depending on location.. Several large trials and systematic reviews have shown progestogens to be effective in preventing or delaying preterm birth in selected high risk women with a singleton pregnancy (including those with a short cervix or previous preterm birth). Although an improvement in short term neonatal outcomes has been shown in some trials these have not consistently been confirmed in meta-analyses. Additionally data on longer term outcomes is limited a single trial where no difference in outcomes was demonstrated at four years of age of the child, despite those in the "progesterone" group having a lower incidence of preterm birth. METHODS: The OPPTIMUM study is a double blind randomized placebo controlled trial to determine whether progesterone prophylaxis to prevent preterm birth has long term neonatal or infant benefit. Specifically it will study whether, in women with singleton pregnancy and at high risk of preterm labour, prophylactic vaginal natural progesterone, 200 mg daily from 22 - 34 weeks gestation, compared to placebo, improves obstetric outcome by lengthening pregnancy thus reducing the incidence of preterm delivery (before 34 weeks), improves neonatal outcome by reducing a composite of death and major morbidity and leads to improved childhood cognitive and neurosensory outcomes at two years of age. Recruitment began in 2009 and is scheduled to close in Spring 2013. As of May 2012, over 800 women had been randomized in 60 sites. DISCUSSION: OPPTIMUM will provide further evidence on the effectiveness of vaginal progesterone for prevention of preterm birth and improvement of neonatal outcomes in selected groups of women with singleton pregnancy at high risk of preterm birth. Additionally it will determine whether any reduction in the incidence of preterm birth is accompanied by improved childhood outcome. Trial registration ISRCTN14568373.

[trial, stroke, patient, acute, datum, ischaemic, rtpa]

Update on the third international stroke trial (IST-3) of thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke and baseline features of the 3035 patients recruited.
BACKGROUND: Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) is approved in Europe for use in patients with acute ischaemic stroke who meet strictly defined criteria. IST-3 sought to improve the external validity and precision of the estimates of the overall treatment effects (efficacy and safety) of rtPA in acute ischaemic stroke, and to determine whether a wider range of patients might benefit. DESIGN: International, multi-centre, prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial of intravenous rtPA in acute ischaemic stroke. Suitable patients had to be assessed and able to start treatment within 6 hours of developing symptoms, and brain imaging must have excluded intracranial haemorrhage and stroke mimics. RESULTS: The initial pilot phase was double blind and then, on 01/08/2003, changed to an open design. Recruitment began on 05/05/2000 and closed on 31/07/2011, by which time 3035 patients had been included, only 61 (2%) of whom met the criteria for the 2003 European approval for thrombolysis. 1617 patients were aged over 80 years at trial entry. The analysis plan will be finalised, without reference to the unblinded data, and published before the trial data are unblinded in early 2012. The main trial results will be presented at the European Stroke Conference in Lisbon in May 2012 with the aim to publish simultaneously in a peer-reviewed journal. The trial result will be presented in the context of an updated Cochrane systematic review. We also intend to include the trial data in an individual patient data meta-analysis of all the relevant randomised trials. CONCLUSION: The data from the trial will: improve the external validity and precision of the estimates of the overall treatment effects (efficacy and safety) of iv rtPA in acute ischaemic stroke; provide: new evidence on the balance of risk and benefit of intravenous rtPA among types of patients who do not clearly meet the terms of the current EU approval; and, provide the first large-scale randomised evidence on effects in patients over 80, an age group which had largely been excluded from previous acute stroke trials.

[cell, immune, protein, organization]

The protean immune cell synapse: a supramolecular structure with many functions.
Heterogeneity in the supramolecular organization of immunological synapses arises from the involvement of different cells, distinct environmental stimuli, and varying levels of protein expression. There may also be heterogeneity in the types and amounts of cell surface proteins and lipids that transfer between lymphocytes during immune surveillance. In addition, immune cells can be involved in the assembly of a 'viral synapse', such that micrometer-scale organization of proteins at intercellular contacts occurs during transmission of a virus between T cells. Thus, while there may be unity in molecular mechanisms underlying the organization of cell surface receptors at immune cell synapses, there is diversity in their function.

Female mediated causes and consequences of status change in a social fish.
In highly social species, dominant individuals often monopolize reproduction, resulting in reproductive investment that is status dependent. Yet, for subordinates, who typically invest less in reproduction, social status can change and opportunities to ascend to dominant social positions are presented suddenly, requiring abrupt changes in behaviour and physiology. In this study, we examined male reproductive anatomy, physiology and behaviour following experimental manipulations of social status in the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish, Neolamprologus pulcher. This unusual fish species lives in permanent social groups composed of a dominant breeding pair and 1–20 subordinates that form a linear social dominance hierarchy. By removing male breeders, we created 18 breeding vacancies and thus provided an opportunity for subordinate males to ascend in status. Dominant females play an important role in regulating status change, as males successfully ascended to breeder status only when they were slightly larger than the female breeder in their social group. Ascending males rapidly assumed behavioural dominance, demonstrated elevated gonadal investment and androgen concentrations compared with males remaining socially subordinate. Interestingly, to increase gonadal investment ascending males appeared to temporarily restrain somatic growth. These results highlight the complex interactions between social status, reproductive physiology and group dynamics, and underscore a convergent pattern of reproductive investment among highly social, cooperative species.

<p>Activated processes such as protein unfolding are highly sensitive to heterogeneity in the environment. We study a highly simplified model of a protein in a random heterogeneous environment, a model of the in vivo environment. It is found that if the heterogeneity is sufficiently large, the total rate of the process is essentially a random variable; this may be the cause of the species-to-species variability in the rate of prion protein conversion found by Deleault et al.</p>

Systems Biology of HIF Metabolism in Cancer
Lay AbstractThe University of ManchesterFaculty of Engineering and Physical SciencesLay Abstract of thesis entitled ‘Systems Biology of HIF Metabolism in Cancer’Submitted by Emily Grace Armitage for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, September 2012Cancer is one of the most devastating human diseases that cause a vast number of mortalities worldwide each year. Cancer research is one of the largest fields in the life sciences and despite many astounding breakthroughs and contributions over the past few decades, there is still a considerable amount to unveil on the function of cancer that would improve diagnostics, prognostics and therapy. Since cancer is known to involve a wide range of processes, applying methods to study it as a whole system could reveal new properties of cancer. Systems biology is becoming an increasingly popular tool in the life sciences. The approach has been applied to many biological and biomedical analyses drawing upon recent advancements in technology. When tumours grow, their oxygen supply becomes scarce and they need to employ mechanisms to overcome this for survival. In this thesis, tumour metabolism has been investigated with particular emphasis on how tumours respond to low oxygen. This has involved the analysis small molecules using state of the art techniques to determine which molecules are caused by and appear to promote survival in tumour cells in low oxygen. These molecules have also been imaged in cross sections of tumours to see where they occur and to hypothesise the function of these molecules based on their position with respect to oxygen availability. Using the data from each analysis it has been possible to link together knowledge about the molecules revealed to consider how tumours survive in low oxygen as a whole system.

Carcinomatous meningitis in solid tumours.
Carcinomatous meningitis (CM) is an uncommon but devastating complication of malignancy. The management is controversial and clear recommendations cannot be made because: 1) Most series include patients with CM that has arisen from different primary malignancies which are associated with different median survival intervals. 2) There have been no prospective randomised investigations of treatment modalities in patients with CM from a particular tumour type. 3) The definition of response varies from one report to another so that some response rates refer to cytological changes in the CSF while others take clinical, cytological and biochemical parameters into account. 4) Reports include patients with and without parenchymal metastases and the natural history of carcinomatous meningitis in the two situations may differ. The median survival of solid tumour carcinomatous meningitis (excluding leukaemia and lymphoma) is approximately 2-3 months and patients with breast cancer have the longest survival (median 3 months). Currently patients are treated with radiotherapy to part or all of the neuraxis with either intrathecal or intravenous chemotherapy but the relative contribution of these modalities to survival or quality of life remains unknown. Approximately 50% of patients with carcinomatous meningitis die from other causes, including systemic disease. The two most important endpoints for the patient, neurological improvement and overall survival, are seldom used in isolation in the literature. Many reports have focused on surrogate markers of response, namely biochemical and cytological data points but the correlation between clinical status and these parameters is poor because of differences between lumbar and ventricular CSF and disturbances of CSF flow in CM. The current literature does not provide clear guidelines for the treatment of this condition. Multicentre, prospective, randomised trials should be conducted that address questions of most relevance to the patient, namely neurological status and overall survival.

However, substation protection and control systems, also known assecondary systems, are changed more frequently, especially electronic orcomputer based systems. One way to overcome the lifecycle-coordinationproblem is to develop a new architecture for substation secondary systems bydeploying new technology such as standard interface modules, the bay processbus and IEC 61850 communication protocol.IEC 61850-9-2 “process bus” has proposed an Ethernet based communicationnetwork to replace traditional hardwiring and cabling, for communication ofanalogue and binary signals with Ethernet messages. The application of processbus in substations is able to reduce the life-time cost of the secondary systemsand improve flexibility and functionality. Sufficient confidence must bedemonstrated in the application of this new technology.This thesis describes the design and performance evaluation of a prototypeprotection scheme suitable for application on a corner of a mesh transmissionsubstation of the type used in the UK on the transmission network.

The autophagic tumor stroma model of cancer: Role of oxidative stress and ketone production in fueling tumor cell metabolism.
A loss of stromal Cav-1 in the tumor fibroblast compartment is associated with early tumor recurrence, lymph-node metastasis, and tamoxifen-resistance, resulting in poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients. Here, we have used Cav-1 (-/-) null mice as a pre-clinical model for this "lethal tumor micro-environment." Metabolic profiling of Cav-1 (-/-) mammary fat pads revealed the upregulation of numerous metabolites (nearly 100), indicative of a major catabolic phenotype. Our results are consistent with the induction of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and autophagy/mitophagy. The two most prominent metabolites that emerged from this analysis were ADMA (asymmetric dimethyl arginine) and BHB (beta-hydroxybutyrate; a ketone body), which are markers of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, respectively. Transcriptional profiling of Cav-1 (-/-) stromal cells and human tumor stroma from breast cancer patients directly supported an association with oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and autophagy/mitophagy, as well as ADMA and ketone production. MircoRNA profiling of Cav-1 (-/-) stromal cells revealed the upregulation of two key cancer-related miR's, namely miR-31 and miR-34c. Consistent with our metabolic findings, these miR's are associated with oxidative stress (miR-34c) or activation of the hypoxic response/HIF1a (miR-31), which is sufficient to drive authophagy/mitophagy. Thus, via an unbiased comprehensive analysis of a lethal tumor micro-environment, we have identified a number of candidate biomarkers (ADMA, ketones, and miR-31/34c) that could be used to identify high-risk cancer patients at diagnosis, for treatment stratification and/or for evaluating therapeutic efficacy during anti-cancer therapy. We propose that the levels of these key biomarkers (ADMA, ketones/BHB, miR-31, and miR-34c) could be (1) assayed using serum or plasma from cancer patients, or (2) performed directly on excised tumor tissue. Importantly, induction of oxidative stress and autophagy/mitophagy in the tumor stromal compartment provides a means by which epithelial cancer cells can directly "feed off" of stromal-derived essential nutrients, chemical building blocks (amino acids, nucleotides), and energy-rich metabolites (glutamine, pyruvate, ketones/BHB), driving tumor progression and metastasis. Essentially, aggressive cancer cells are "eating" the cancer-associated fibroblasts via autophagy/mitophagy in the tumor micro-environment. Lastly, we discuss that this "Autophagic Tumor Stroma Model of Cancer Metabolism" provides a viable solution to the "Autophagy Paradox" in cancer etiology and chemo-therapy.

QRA: A Quality Requirements Analysis Approach for Service Systems
Although quality requirements (QRs) are considered as being of crucial importance in today’s service-oriented systems, existing approaches almost exclusively deal with QRs from the service providers’ perspective (namely late QRs). The motivation for this paper is to address the analysis of QRs from the service customers’ perspective (namely early QRs). The work presented in this paper focuses on the way that early QRs may be modeled and evaluated and demonstrates this approach on a stock trading service system – a real-world practice taken from an international firm in the financial sector. We focus on three QRs that are critical to service systems and especially that of stock trading, namely performance, availability and security. We introduce a modeling paradigm that extends the well-known UML Activity Diagram by explicitly representing these three QRs as an integral part of business process modeling and augments this modeling with quantitative and qualitative reasoning that together provide the means for enhanced decision making by service customers.

Cochlear implantation in children with Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome - a cautionary tale.
OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Jervell and Lange-Nielsen (JLN) syndrome is a rare cause of congenital profound hearing loss associated with a prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram. Children presenting for cochlear implantation with this condition may be asymptomatic but are at risk of sudden death. SCREENING AND SUBSEQUENT: careful management is therefore required to ensure a successful outcome. We present our experience of cochlear implantation in children with JLN syndrome, including two who died unexpectedly, and suggest a protocol for management of such cases. Clinical presentation Four cases of cochlear implantation in JLN syndrome are described. None had any previous cardiological family history. Two were diagnosed pre-operatively but, despite appropriate management under a cardiologist, died from cardiac arrest; the first in the perioperative period following reimplantation for infection, and the second unrelated to his cochlear implant surgery. The other two patients were diagnosed only subsequent to their implantation and continue to use their implants successfully. CONCLUSION: These cases highlight the variation in presentation of JLN syndrome, and the spectrum of disease severity that exists. Our protocol stresses the importance of careful assessment and counselling of parents by an experienced implant team.

Electrical stimulation and swallowing: how much do we know?
Consequences of dysphagia substantially reduce quality of life, increase the risk of medical complications and mortality, and pose a substantial cost to healthcare systems. As a result, it is of no wonder that the clinical and scientific communities are showing interest in new avenues for dysphagia rehabilitation. Electrical stimulation (e-stim) for the treatment of swallowing impairments is among the most studied swallowing interventions in the published literature, yet many unanswered questions about its efficacy remain. In the meantime, many speech-language pathologists who treat dysphagia are attending educational and training sessions to obtain certifications to use this technique. Here, we review the values and limitations of the published literature on the topic of e-stim for swallowing to assist clinicians in decision making in their clinical practice. The discussion provides a review of swallowing anatomy and physiology, the fundamentals of e-stim, and information essential for the readers' independent critique of these studies--all of which are crucial for evaluating the possible effects of e-stim.

[aging, cancer, mitochondrial, cell, metabolism, tumor, metabolic, host]

Is cancer a metabolic rebellion against host aging? In the quest for immortality, tumor cells try to save themselves by boosting mitochondrial metabolism.
Aging drives large systemic reductions in oxidative mitochondrial function, shifting the entire body metabolically towards aerobic glycolysis, a.k.a, the Warburg effect. Aging is also one of the most significant risk factors for the development of human cancers, including breast tumors. How are these two findings connected? One simplistic idea is that cancer cells rebel against the aging process by increasing their capacity for oxidative mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS). Then, local and systemic aerobic glycolysis in the aging host would provide energy-rich mitochondrial fuels (such as L-lactate and ketones) to directly "fuel" tumor cell growth and metastasis. This would establish a type of parasite-host relationship or "two-compartment tumor metabolism", with glycolytic/oxidative metabolic-coupling. The cancer cells ("the seeds") would flourish in this nutrient-rich microenvironment ("the soil"), which has been fertilized by host aging. In this scenario, cancer cells are only trying to save themselves from the consequences of aging, by engineering a metabolic mutiny, through the amplification of mitochondrial metabolism. We discuss the recent findings of Drs. Ron DePinho (MD Anderson) and Craig Thomspson (Sloan-Kettering) that are also consistent with this new hypothesis, linking cancer progression with metabolic aging. Using data mining and bioinformatics approaches, we also provide key evidence of a role for PGC1a/NRF1 signaling in the pathogenesis of (1) two-compartment tumor metabolism, and (2) mitochondrial biogenesis in human breast cancer cells.

HOMA-S is associated with greater HbA1c reduction with a GLP-1 analogue in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Exenatide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue, is an effective glucoregulator for treating overweight individuals, not at target HbA1 c. This prospective study aimed to determine whether estimates of beta cell function (HOMA-B) and insulin sensitivity (HOMA-S) predict response to Exenatide treatment.Prospective data on 43 type 2 diabetes patients were collected for up to 2.8 years in UK primary care. HOMA-B and HOMA-S were estimated prior to initiating Exenatide, with monitoring of cardio-metabolic risk factors.Mean (SD) age and BMI pre-treatment were 54.1±10.5 years and 35.7±7.5 kg/m2 respectively. HbA1c decreased (mean reduction 0.9%, p=0.04; p for trend=0.01) in 61% of patients. In univariate analyses, HOMA-S as a measure of insulin sensitivity was inversely (β=- 0.41, p 0.009) related to change in HbA1c, with no relation for HOMA-B.In a random effects regression model that included age at baseline, weight, LDL-C, HDL-C and triglycerides, change in HbA1c (β= - 0.14, p<0.001) and HDL-C (β= - 0.52, p=0.011) were independently associated with increasing insulin sensitivity (r2=0.52). Thus patients with greater measured insulin sensitivity achieved greater reduction in HbA1c independent of the factors described above.In logistic regression those in the highest tertile of log-HOMA-S were 45% more likely to have a fall in HbA1c with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.55 (95% CI 0.47-0.66) p<0.0001 (log likelihood ratio for the model χ2=71.6, p<0.0001).Patients with greater measured insulin sensitivity achieve greater reduction in HbA1c with Exenatide. Determination of insulin sensitivity may assist in guiding outcome expectation in overweight patients treated with GLP-1 analogues.

Randomised phase II trial of 4 dose levels of single agent docetaxel in performance status (PS) 2 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): DOC PS2 trial. Manchester lung cancer group.
BACKGROUND: The role of chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC patients and ECOG PS2 remains controversial. We evaluated 4 doses of 3-weekly docetaxel to identify a less toxic, clinically effective dose. METHODS: Seventy-three patients with stage III (22%) (unsuitable for radical surgery/radiotherapy) and IV (78%) NSCLC were randomized to receive 4 doses of 3-weekly docetaxel, for 4 cycles: arm (A) 40 mg/m(2) (n=17), arm (B) 50 mg/m(2) (n=17), arm (C) 60 mg/m(2) (n=19), arm (D) 50 mg/m(2) escalated by 10 mg/m(2) to a maximum of 70 mg/m(2) (n=19). Primary endpoints: maximum tolerated dose, RR, duration of response, symptom improvement, toxicity and QoL. Secondary endpoint: overall survival (OS). Patients and disease characteristics were well balanced. Median age was 67 (range 45-81), there were 32 male and 41 female, histology subtype: squamous/adenocarcinoma/mixed/NOS=42%/49%/4%/5%. RESULTS: Seven patients did not receive any treatment because of deterioration in PS or death. 50% of patients in arm D, who received more than one cycle, received dose escalation. There was no statistical difference in the number of cycles administered (arms A, B and D: median 2 cycles and arm C: median 3 cycles) and no difference in RR: arm A=6%, arm B=6%, arm C=10%, and arm D=0%. There was no statistically significant difference in grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia between the four arms. No difference was observed in hospitalization rate, blood transfusions, antibiotics administration and non-haematological toxicity. QoL: no difference in total scores between baseline and cycles 1-4. There was a significant decrease in pain scores from baseline to post cycles 2 and 3 (p=0.025 and p=0.002, respectively). There was no difference in OS (p=0.992). Median survival and 6-month survival were 61, 86, 88 and 97 days and 29%, 33%, 21% and 26% for arms A, B, C, and D, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical efficacy of docetaxel was observed at all dose levels. Higher dose levels were not associated with increased toxicities, use of IV antibiotics or hospitalization rates. However, the median survival observed is shorter than historical data and do not support further evaluation of these doses of single agent docetaxel in this population.

[stat3, dna, pathway, damage]

STAT3 modulates the DNA damage response pathway.
The STAT3 transcription factor is well known to function as an anti-apoptotic factor, especially in numerous malignancies. Recently we showed that STAT3 is cytoprotective and that cells lacking STAT3 are more sensitive to oxidative stress. A key feature of oxidative stress involves activation of the DNA damage pathway. However, a role for STAT3 or its contribution in response to DNA damage has not been described. In the present study we show that cells lacking STAT3 are less efficient in repairing damaged DNA. Moreover, STAT3 deficient cells show reduced activity of the ATM-Chk2 and ATR-Chk1 pathways, both important pathways in sensing DNA damage. Finally we show that MDC1, a regulator of the ATM-Chk2 pathway and facilitator of the DNA damage response, is modulated by STAT3 at the transcriptional level. These findings demonstrate that STAT3 is necessary for efficient repair of damaged DNA, partly by modulating the ATM-Chk2 and ATR-Chk1 pathways.

<p>The acceptance of this lack of innovation in the design of such a truly global, mass-produced, multi-purpose technological artefact has had an enormous effect on the conception, perception and consumption of the computer, and possibly of information technology itself.

Competitiveness and Technological Upgrading in Global Value Chains: Evidence from the Indonesian Electronics and Garment Sectors
Indonesia is a rapidly growing and internationally competitive economy that is well integrated into globalised production systems. The global value chain (GVC) model has proven a popular analytical framework to explain how global lead firms structure and organise global production through dispersed global suppliers. Indonesia’s leading export sectors, garments and electronics, are well integrated into GVCs. Engagement in GVCs, often led by leading global brands, is seen as a basis for local producers to become globally competitive and to grow. It also comes with challenges – local producers must meet the demanding pressures from lead firms on prices, on-time delivery, product quality, and social, environmental and labour standards. The possibilities for local producers to learn, acquire new capabilities and upgrade to enhance their competitiveness are often conditioned by the nature of ties that they have with their global lead firms. Yet, this paper argues, the GVC model fails to recognise agency on the part of local firms in this learning process. Moreover, particular forms of governance arrangements within GVC ties can restrict prospects for local producers to enhance capabilities and upgrade. Drawing on selected case study evidence from the Indonesian garments and electronics sectors, the paper explores the relationship between distinct types of GVC engagements and firm level learning and upgrading, and considers how some GVC ties may restrict upgrading.

Larval therapy for leg ulcers (VenUS II): randomised controlled trial.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical effectiveness of larval therapy with a standard debridement technique (hydrogel) for sloughy or necrotic leg ulcers. DESIGN: Pragmatic, three armed randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Community nurse led services, hospital wards, and hospital outpatient leg ulcer clinics in urban and rural settings, United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: 267 patients with at least one venous or mixed venous and arterial ulcer with at least 25% coverage of slough or necrotic tissue, and an ankle brachial pressure index of 0.6 or more. INTERVENTIONS: Loose larvae, bagged larvae, and hydrogel. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was time to healing of the largest eligible ulcer. Secondary outcomes were time to debridement, health related quality of life (SF-12), bacterial load, presence of meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, adverse events, and ulcer related pain (visual analogue scale, from 0 mm for no pain to 150 mm for worst pain imaginable). RESULTS: Time to healing was not significantly different between the loose or bagged larvae group and the hydrogel group (hazard ratio for healing using larvae v hydrogel 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.76 to 1.68; P=0.54). Larval therapy significantly reduced the time to debridement (2.31, 1.65 to 3.2; P<0.001). Health related quality of life and change in bacterial load over time were not significantly different between the groups. 6.7% of participants had MRSA at baseline. No difference was found between larval therapy and hydrogel in their ability to eradicate MRSA by the end of the debridement phase (75% (9/12) v 50% (3/6); P=0.34), although this comparison was underpowered. Mean ulcer related pain scores were higher in either larvae group compared with hydrogel (mean difference in pain score: loose larvae v hydrogel 46.74 (95% confidence interval 32.44 to 61.04), P<0.001; bagged larvae v hydrogel 38.58 (23.46 to 53.70), P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Larval therapy did not improve the rate of healing of sloughy or necrotic leg ulcers or reduce bacterial load compared with hydrogel but did significantly reduce the time to debridement and increase ulcer pain.

[node, sinus, human, pacemaker, distribution, heart, right, area, anatomical, atrium]

Computer three-dimensional anatomical reconstruction of the human sinus node and a novel paranodal area.
We have previously shown in rabbit that the pacemaker of the heart (the sinus node) is widespread and matches the wide distribution of the leading pacemaker site within the right atrium. There is, however, uncertainty about the precise location of the pacemaker in human heart, and its spatial relationships with the surrounding right atrial muscle. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate the distribution of the sinus node tissue in a series of healthy human hearts and, for one of the hearts to construct a computer three-dimensional anatomical model of the sinus node, including the likely orientation of myocytes. A combination of experimental techniques--diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI), histology, immunohistochemistry, image processing and computer modelling--was used. Our data show that the sinus node was larger than in previous studies and, most importantly, we identified a previously unknown area running alongside the sinus node (the "paranodal area"), which is even more extensive than the sinus node. This area possesses properties of both nodal and atrial tissues and may have a role in pacemaking. For example, it could explain the wide spread distribution of the leading pacemaker site in human right atrium, a phenomenon known as the wandering pacemaker observed in clinics. In summary, a novel 3D anatomical reconstruction presents a new picture of the distribution of nodal cells within the human right atrium.

Complete and robust bandgap switching in double-inverse-opal photonic crystals
<p>The authors theoretically demonstrate a practical scheme for robust and complete photonic bandgap switching using a three-dimensional double-inverse-opal photonic crystal. The investigated structure consists of a close-packed face-centered-cubic arrangement of spherical air pores, interconnected via air channels and embedded in a high-index (tin disulfide) backbone. We show that by placing lower-index movable dielectric scatterers (titania) inside the air pores, a complete photonic bandgap opens for certain positions of the scatterers, which altogether closes for other positions. Our analysis reveals that this switching scheme is robust to geometric imperfections and allows for sizeable bandgap switching. (c) 2008 American Institute of Physics.</p>

Support surfaces for treating pressure injury: a Cochrane systematic review.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects on healing of pressure relieving support surfaces in the treatment of pressure injury. DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Cochrane Wound Group Specialised Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL. The reference sections of included trials were searched for further trials. REVIEW METHODS: Randomised controlled trials, published or unpublished, assessing the effect of support surfaces in treating all pressure injuries were sought. All included studies had to have reported objective measures of pressure injury healing. Where possible, findings from individual trials were calculated using risk ratio estimates or mean difference with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Eighteen eligible trials involving 1309 participants were identified. There was no statistically significant effect on pressure injury size with low air loss devices compared with foam alternatives. One small trial at high risk of bias found that sheepskin positioned under the legs significantly reduced redness and a very small subgroup analysis favoured a profiling bed when compared with a standard bed in terms of the healing of grade 1 pressure injuries. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there was an absence of good evidence to support the superiority of any pressure relieving device in the treatment of pressure injuries. This review highlights that the current evidence base requires improving by undertaking robust trials to ascertain which support surfaces are most effective for the treatment of pressure injuries.

Excitonic Signatures in the Photoluminescence and Terahertz Absorption of a GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs Multiple Quantum Well
<p>Measurements of the THz absorption and the time-resolved photoluminescence have been performed on the same GaAs quantum well sample. The strength of the absorption at the internal 1s-2p exciton transition frequency is used as a measure of the density of excitons in the sample. When the interband pump laser is resonant with the Is exciton frequency, induced absorption at the 1s-2p frequency is clearly seen. If the same density of carriers is created pumping in the continuum, no significant 1s-2p absorption is seen in a time window of 450 ps. Complementary time-resolved photoluminescence experiments, detecting the emission at the exciton energy under the same pump conditions, show the PL intensity in resonant and nonresonant cases to be similar. The counter-intuitive existence of luminescence at the exciton energy simultaneously with the absence of the 1s-2p absorption is consistent with the recent theoretical predictions of Kira et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 3263 (1998).</p>

Nitrogen dynamics in oak model ecosystems subjected to air warming and drought on two different soils
Being tolerant to heat and drought, oaks are promising candidates for future forestry in view of climate change in Central Europe. Air warming is expected to increase, and drought decrease soil N availability and thus N supply to trees. Here, we conducted a model ecosystem experiment, in which mixed stands of young oaks (Quercus robur, Q. petraea and Q. pubescens) were grown on two different soils and subjected to four climate treatments during three growing seasons: air warming by 1–2 °C, drought periods (average precipitation reduction of 43–60%), a combination of these two treatments, and a control. In contrast to our hypotheses, neither air warming nor drought significantly affected N availability, whereas total amounts, vertical distribution and availability of soil N showed substantial differences between the two soils. While air warming had no effect on tree growth and N accumulation, the drought treatment reduced tree growth and increased, or tended to increase, N accumulation in the reduced biomass, indicating that growth was not limited by N. Furthermore, 15N-labelling revealed that this accumulation was associated with an increased uptake of nitrate. On the basis of our results, climate change effects on N dynamics are expected to be less important in oak stands than reduced soil water availability.

The cardiovascular manifestations of influenza: A systematic review.
Influenza accounts for 3 to 5million cases of severe illness and up to 300,000 deaths annually, presenting a considerable burden to healthcare services. A spectrum of cardiovascular complications has been reported in association with influenza infection. This can occur through direct effects of the virus on the myocardium or through exacerbation of existing cardiovascular disease. Direct myocardial involvement presenting as myocarditis is not uncommon during influenza infection. Clinical presentation may vary from asymptomatic to fulminant myocarditis resulting in cardiogenic shock and death. Cardiovascular mortality is also increased during influenza epidemics in patients with pre-existing coronary artery disease. Rates of myocardial infarction have been shown to increase following influenza outbreaks, whilst decreases in cardiovascular mortality have been demonstrated following influenza vaccination in high risk patients. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of cardiovascular complications, their presentation, clinical course and the management options available following influenza infection.

Carboxylic acid reductase is a versatile enzyme for the conversion of fatty acids into fuels and chemical commodities
Aliphatic hydrocarbons such as fatty alcohols and petroleum-derived alkanes have numerous applications in the chemical industry. In recent years, the renewable synthesis of aliphatic hydrocarbons has been made possible by engineering microbes to overaccumulate fatty acids. However, to generate end products with the desired physicochemical properties (e.g., fatty aldehydes, alkanes, and alcohols), further conversion of the fatty acid is necessary. A carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) from Mycobacterium marinum was found to convert a wide range of aliphatic fatty acids (C6–C18) into corresponding aldehydes. Together with the broad-substrate specificity of an aldehyde reductase or an aldehyde decarbonylase, the catalytic conversion of fatty acids to fatty alcohols (C8–C16) or fatty alkanes (C7–C15) was reconstituted in vitro. This concept was applied in vivo, in combination with a chain-length-specific thioesterase, to engineer Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strains that were capable of synthesizing fatty alcohols and alkanes. A fatty alcohol titer exceeding 350 mg·L−1 was obtained in minimal media supplemented with glucose. Moreover, by combining the CAR-dependent pathway with an exogenous fatty acid-generating lipase, natural oils (coconut oil, palm oil, and algal oil bodies) were enzymatically converted into fatty alcohols across a broad chain-length range (C8–C18). Together with complementing enzymes, the broad substrate specificity and kinetic characteristics of CAR opens the road for direct and tailored enzyme-catalyzed conversion of lipids into user-ready chemical commodities.

[placental, shape]

A Stochastic Model for Early Placental Development
In the human, placental structure is closely related to placental function and consequent pregnancy outcome. Studies have noted abnormal placental shape in small-for-gestational age infants which extends to increased lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease. The origins and determinants of placental shape are incompletely understood and are difficult to study in vivo. In this paper we model the early development of the placenta in the human, based on the hypothesis that this is driven by dynamics dominated by a chemo-attractant effect emanating from proximal spiral arteries in the decidua. We derive and explore a two-dimensional stochastic model for these events, and investigate the effects of loss of spiral arteries in regions near to the cord insertion on the shape of the placenta. This model demonstrates that placental shape is highly variable and disruption of spiral arteries can exert profound effects on placental shape, particularly if this disruption is close to the cord insertion. Thus, placental shape reflects the underlying maternal vascular bed. Abnormal placental shape may reflect an abnormal uterine environment, which predisposes to pregnancy complications.

Pilot study of intense pulsed light for the treatment of systemic sclerosis-related telangiectases.
BACKGROUND: Telangiectases represent microvascular changes inherent in the systemic sclerosis (SSc) disease process. Intense pulsed light (IPL) is an effective treatment for non-SSc-related cutaneous telangiectases. OBJECTIVES: This pilot study aimed to examine the efficacy, safety and tolerability of IPL treatment in an open study of patients with SSc. METHODS: Patients underwent three treatments of IPL at monthly intervals and attended follow-up examinations at 1, 6 and 12 months after final treatment. Photographs, laser Doppler imaging (LDI) and thermography were used to measure changes at each visit. RESULTS: Seventeen patients completed the study. Photographs were graded (compared with baseline) as: at 1-month follow-up, four 'no change', four 'improved' and eight 'much improved'; at 6-month follow-up, four 'no change', eight 'improved'; and four 'much improved'; and at 12-month follow-up (eight images were available), three 'no change', two 'improved' and three 'much improved'. Perfusion as measured by LDI (perfusion units) was significantly reduced, compared with baseline median 2·66, interquartile range (1·78-3·93), at 1 month 1·70 (1·07-2·55), P = 0·006 and 6 months 2·05 (1·42-2·36), P = 0·008 post-treatment, but not at 12 months 1·61 (1·14-3·22), P =0·088. No differences were found in skin temperature between baseline and follow-up visits. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study (the first of IPL treatment for SSc-related telangiectases) most patients improved after IPL treatment. However, the degree of improvement was not maintained in all patients at 6-12 months, suggesting that further treatments may be necessary. Longer term studies of this novel treatment approach are now required.

Spin-half paramagnetism in graphene induced by point defects
The possibility to induce a magnetic response in graphene by the introduction of defects has been generating much interest, as this would expand the already impressive list of its special properties and allow novel devices where charge and spin manipulation could be combined. So far there have been many theoretical studies (for reviews, see refs 1-3) predicting that point defects in graphene should carry magnetic moments mu similar to mu(B) and these can in principle couple (anti) ferromagnetically(1-12). However, experimental evidence for such magnetism remains both scarce and controversial(13-16). Here we show that point defects in graphene-(1) fluorine adatoms in concentrations x gradually increasing to stoichiometric fluorographene CFx=1.0 (ref. 17) and (2) irradiation defects (vacancies)-carry magnetic moments with spin 1/2. Both types of defect lead to notable paramagnetism but no magnetic ordering could be detected down to liquid helium temperatures. The induced paramagnetism dominates graphene's low-temperature magnetic properties, despite the fact that the maximum response we could achieve was limited to one moment per approximately 1,000 carbon atoms. This limitation is explained by clustering of adatoms and, for the case of vacancies, by the loss of graphene's structural stability. Our work clarifies the controversial issue of graphene's magnetism and sets limits for other graphitic compounds.

Coatings of thicknesses between 2 and 8 monolayers (ML) are analyzed using energy-loss spectroscopic profiling (ELSP), by studying the variations in the plasmon excitations across the coated nanotube, as a function of the coating thickness. We find a change in the ELSP for coatings above 5 ML thickness, which we interpret in terms of a change in its dielectric properties.</p>

Long-scale modulation of electron beam energy in free electron lasers
The effects of pre-conditioned electron beams on free electron laser (FEL) behaviour are considered in simulations. Under consideration is modulation of the electron beam energy, using long-scale modulation period relative to the resonant FEL wavelength. Structure can be generated in the radiation field and electron beam with extent of significantly less than the FEL co-operation length, without applying spatio-temporal shifts between the radiation and electron beam.

Model-based prognosis for intergranular corrosion
Among the advantages of Aluminium-based alloys for structural use is their corrosion resistance. However, while Aluminium alloys are highly resistant to uniform (general) corrosion, they are much more susceptible to types of localised corrosion, especially intergranular corrosion, which is a localised attack along the grain boundaries which leaves the grains themselves largely unaffected. In order to estimate the progress of such corrosion in a given sample, it is considered possible to generate a numerical model of some sort. While there has been much effort spent in the development of electrochemistry-based models, the use of grey and black-box models remains largely unexplored. One exception to this is the use of Cellular Automata (CA) models which have recently been exploited to model the progression of uniform corrosion. The object of the current paper is to apply the CA methodology to the case of intergranular corrosion. The first phase of the work has been concerned with generating appropriate CA rules which can qualitatively reproduce observed physics, and this work is reported here. A model is proposed which shows qualitative agreement with experimental data on the advance of the corrosion front.

Area efficient asynchronous SDM routers using 2-stage Clos switches
Asynchronous on-chip networks are good candidates for multi-core applications requiring low-power consumption. Asynchronous spatial division multiplexing (SDM) routers provide better throughput with lower area overhead than asynchronous virtual channel routers; however, the area overhead of SDM routers is still significant due to their high-radix central switches. A new 2-stage Clos switch is proposed to reduce the area overhead of asynchronous SDM routers. It is shown that replacing the crossbars with the 2-stage Clos switches can significantly reduce the area overhead of SDM routers when more than two virtual circuits are used. The saturation throughput is slightly reduced but the area to throughput efficiency is improved. Using Clos switches increases the energy consumption of switches but the energy of buffers is reduced.

Solution stability, neutral evolution and variability in a simple model of globular proteins
<p>It is well known among molecular biologists that proteins with a common ancestor and that perform the same function in similar organisms, can have rather different amino-acid sequences. Mutations have altered the amino-acid sequences without affecting the function. A simple model of a protein in which the interactions are encoded by sequences of bits is introduced, and used to study how mutations can change these bits, and hence the interactions, while maintaining the stability of the protein solution. This stability is a simple minimal requirement on our model proteins which mimics part of the requirement on a real protein to be functional. The properties of our model protein, such as its second virial coefficient, are found to vary significantly from one model protein to another. It is suggested that this may also be the case for real proteins in vivo.</p>

[polysaccharide, product, pectin, residue, nab, wall, radical, cell]

Fingerprinting of polysaccharides attacked by hydroxyl radicals in vitro and in the cell walls of ripening pear fruit.
Hydroxyl radicals (*OH) may cause non-enzymic scission of polysaccharides in vivo, e.g. in plant cell walls and mammalian connective tissues. To provide a method for detecting the action of endogenous *OH in vivo, we investigated the products formed when polysaccharides were treated with *OH (generated in situ by ascorbate-H(2)O(2)-Cu(2+) mixtures) followed by NaB(3)H(4). Treatment with *OH increased the number of NaB(3)H(4)-reacting groups present in citrus pectin, homogalacturonan and tamarind xyloglucan. This increase is attributed partly to the formation of glycosulose and glycosulosuronic acid residues, which are then reduced back to the original (but radioactive) sugar residues and their epimers by NaB(3)H(4). The glycosulose and glycosulosuronic acid residues were stable for >16 h at 20 degrees C in ethanol or buffer (pH 4.7), but were destroyed in alkali. Driselase-digestion of the radiolabelled polysaccharides yielded characteristic patterns of (3)H-products, which included galactose and galacturonate from pectin, and isoprimeverose, galactose, glucose and arabinose from xyloglucan. Pectin yielded at least eight (3)H-labelled anionic products, separable by electrophoresis at pH 3.5. The patterns of radioactive products form useful 'fingerprints' by which *OH-attacked polysaccharides may be recognized. Applied to the cell walls of ripening pear (Pyrus communis) fruit, the method gave evidence for progressive *OH radical attack on polysaccharides during the softening process.

[dd, xiaflex, fibroblast, collagenase, disease]

In vitro study of novel collagenase (XIAFLEX®) on Dupuytren's disease fibroblasts displays unique drug related properties.
Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a benign, fibroproliferative disease of the palmar fascia, with excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and over-production of cytokines and growth factors, resulting in digital fixed flexion contractures limiting hand function and patient quality of life. Surgical fasciectomy is the gold standard treatment but is invasive and has associated morbidity without limiting disease recurrence. Injectable Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH)--Xiaflex®--is a novel, nonsurgical option with clinically proven in vivo reduction of DD contractures but with limited in vitro data demonstrating its cellular and molecular effects. The aim of this study was to delineate the effects of CCH on primary fibroblasts isolated from DD and non-DD anatomical sites (using RTCA, LDH, WST-1, FACS, qRT-PCR, ELISA and In-Cell Quantitative Western Blotting) to compare the efficacy of varying concentrations of Xiaflex® against a reagent grade Collagenase, Collagenase A. Results demonstrated that DD nodule and cord fibroblasts had greater proliferation than those from fat and skin. Xiaflex® exposure resulted in dose- and time-dependent inhibition of cellular spreading, attachment and proliferation, with cellular recovery after enzyme removal. Unlike Collagenase A, Xiaflex® did not cause apoptosis. Collagen expression patterns were significantly (p<0.05) different in DD fibroblasts across anatomical sites - the highest levels of collagen I and III were detected in DD nodule, with DD cord and fat fibroblasts demonstrating a smaller increase in both collagen expression relative to DD skin. Xiaflex® significantly (p<0.05) down-regulated ECM components, cytokines and growth factors in a dose-dependent manner. An in vitro scratch wound assay model demonstrated that, at low concentrations, Xiaflex® enabled a faster fibroblast reparatory migration into the wound, whereas, at high concentrations, this process was significantly (p<0.05) inhibited. This is the first report elucidating potential mechanisms of action of Xiaflex® on Dupuytren fibroblasts, offering a greater insight and a better understanding of its effect in DD.

[metamorphism, belt, rock, cordierite, greenstone, apprx, peak, biotite, terrane, barberton]

Amphibolite facies metamorphism in the Schapenburg schist belt: a record of the mid-crustal response to .apprx.3.23 Ga terrane accretion in the Barberton greenstone belt.
The Schapenburg Schist Belt (South Africa) is one of several large greenstone remnants exposed in the granitoid-dominated terrane to the south of the Barberton greenstone belt and is unique in that it contains a well-developed metasedimentary sequence in addn. to the typical mafic-ultramafic volcanic rocks. Detrital zircons within the metasediments have ages as young as .apprx.3.24 Ga and consequently, these rocks correlate with Fig Tree Group sediments exposed in the central portions of the Barberton greenstone belt some 60km to the north, where they are metamorphosed to greenschist facies conditions. The Schapenburg metasediments are relatively K2O-poor, and are commonly characterized by the peak metamorphic assemblage garnet + cordierite + gedrite + biotite + quartz +- plagioclase. Other assemblages recorded are garnet + cummingtonite + biotite + quartz, cordierite + biotite + sillimanite + quartz and cordierite + biotite + anthophyllite. In all cases the peak assemblages are texturally very well equilibrated and the predominantly almandine garnets from all rock types show almost flat zonation patterns for Fe, Mg, Mn and Ca. Anal. using FMASH reaction relations; as well as a variety of geothermometers and barometers, has constrained the peak metamorphic pressure-temp. conditions to 640 +- 40 DegC and 4.8 +- 1.0 kbar. The max. age of metamorphism is defined by the .apprx.3.23 Ga age of a syntectonic tonalite intrusion into the central portion of the schist belt. Thus, sedimentation, burial to mid-crustal depths, and amphibolite facies equilibration were achieved in a time span similar to .apprx.15 Ma. The strong bedding-parallel foliation in the metasediments dips to the east at an angle of 75 to 85 Deg. In this foliation plane elongated cordierite rods produced during prograde metamorphism define a close to vertical mineral lineation. The metasedimentary succession youngs to the east and in this direction is overlain by older Onverwacht Group rocks. Thus, the cordierite lineation might represent a transposed lineation developed during thrust stacking. Post kinematic static recrystn. has largely obscured the prograde history of the rocks. However, the pressure-temp. conditions of peak metamorphism, the age of metamorphism, the rapidity of metamorphism following sedimentation, the presence of cordierite on the prograde, path, as well as the timing of metamorphism relative to deformation strongly suggest that metamorphism occurred in an arc-style collisional setting. Thus, the rocks of this study most likely represent an exhumed mid-crustal terrane equilibrated during the proposed .apprx.3230 Ma terrane accretion event in the Barberton Greenstone Belt, and records an apparent geothermal gradient typical for portions of modern orogenic belts of this type. on SciFinder (R)

Discrete Mode Tuning in Terahertz Quantum Cascade Lasers
A holographically designed, aperiodic distributed feedback grating is used as a multi-resonance filter and embedded within an existing Fabry-Pérot (FP) terahertz (THz) quantum cascade laser (QCL) cavity. Balancing the feedback strengths of the filter resonances and the FP cavity creates a system capable of a high degree of single-mode selectivity, which is sensitive to changes in driving current. Multi-moded QCLs operating around 2.9 THz are thus modified to achieve purely electronic discrete tuning spanning over 160 GHz with an average tuning resolution of 30 GHz. Applying the same multi-resonance filter to QCLs with gain peaks around 2.65 and 2.9 THz leads to dual-mode lasing with an electrically controlled frequency separation of between 190 and 267 GHz. A phase sensitive mode selection mechanism is experimentally confirmed by the observation of divergent fine-tuning of the lasing modes.

Visual Performance and Optical Quality with Soft toric Contact Lenses and Rigid Gas Permeable Lenses in Keratoconus Patients
Purpose: To assess visual performance and higher-order ocular aberrations in keratoconic patients using toric soft contact lenses (SCL), rigid-gas-permeable (RGP) contact lenses and spectacle lens correction.
Methods: Twenty-two keratoconus patients (16 RGP lens wearers and 6 spectacle wearers) were fitted with toric SCL. Ocular aberrations were measured with and without the patient’s habitual RGP lenses and with the SCL in place. In the spectacle wearers, aberrations were measured with and without the SCL. Visual performance (high- and low-contrast visual acuity) was evaluated with the patient’s habitual correction and with the SCL.
Results: Both the habitual lenses and the toric SCL significantly reduced coma, trefoil, 3rd-order, 4th-order cylinder and higher-order root-mean-square (RMS) aberrations (p ≤ 0.015) in RGP lens wearers. In the spectacle wearers the toric SCL significantly reduced coma, 3rd-order and higher-order RMS aberrations (p ≤ 0.01). The patients’ habitual RGP lenses gave better low-contrast acuity (p ≤ 0.006) compared to the toric SCL; however, no significant difference was found between lens types for high-contrast acuity (p = 0.10). No significant differences in visual performance measurements were found between the patients’ spectacles and the toric SCL (p ≥ 0.06) in spectacle lens wearers.
Conclusions: The results show that RGP lenses provided superior visual performances and greater reduction of 3rd-order aberrations compared to toric SCL in this group of keratoconic patients. In the spectacle-wearing group, visual performance with the toric SCL was found to be comparable to that measured with spectacles. Nonetheless, with the exception of spherical aberration, the toric SCL were successful in significantly reducing uncorrected higher-order aberrations.

Secondary teachers' perceptions of the effectiveness of their pre-service education and strategies to improve pre-service education for teachers: A school based training route in England
This study aims to provide a deeper understanding of the impact of an EBITT course on teachers' early professional development, identify strengths of the course and also the ways in which the training could be improved. Data collected was recorded during individual face- to- face interviews using a structured interview schedule. In devising our approach we utilised the model suggested by Sharon Feiman-Nemser in her article How do Teachers Learn to Teach?  in Cochran - Smith et. al.  (2008) Handbook of Research on Teacher Education
The data was analysed to explore (after 2-4 years reflection):
•	which elements of initial training were valuable and less valuable 
•	what they have learned since the course
•	which aspects of the course the teachers feel should be improved
It was cross referenced against findings from national surveys of teachers in their post qualifying year of teaching (induction year) and early years of teaching conducted by the TDA. These findings were presented as part of a common wider international study on the same theme in four countries (UK, Spain, Australia, and Ireland).

A critical role for OX40 in T cell-mediated immunopathology during lung viral infection.
Respiratory infections are the third leading cause of death worldwide. Illness is caused by pathogen replication and disruption of airway homeostasis by excessive expansion of cell numbers. One strategy to prevent lung immune-mediated damage involves reducing the cellular burden. To date, antiinflammatory strategies have affected both antigen-specific and naive immune repertoires. Here we report a novel form of immune intervention that specifically targets recently activated T cells alone. OX40 (CD134) is absent on naive T cells but up-regulated 1-2 d after antigen activation. OX40-immunoglobulin fusion proteins block the interaction of OX40 with its ligand on antigen-presenting cells and eliminate weight loss and cachexia without preventing virus clearance. Reduced proliferation and enhanced apoptosis of lung cells accompanied the improved clinical phenotype. Manipulation of this late costimulatory pathway has clear therapeutic potential for the treatment of dysregulated lung immune responses.

Neuroendocrine and epithelial phenotypes in small-cell lung cancer: implications for metastasis and survival in patients.
Background:Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) has a very aggressive clinical course with early metastasis. This study investigated how the distinctive neuroendocrine characteristics contribute to disease progression and invasion in human SCLC.Methods:The neuroendocrine phenotype (pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)) was quantified by ELISA in blood samples from 43 SCLC patients. The neuroendocrine (POMC, chromogranin A, neuron-specific enolase, NCAM) and epithelial (cytokeratin and E-cadherin) phenotypes were investigated, using ELISA and immunocytochemistry/immunohistochemistry.Results:In SCLC patients, 16% had elevated circulating POMC, which was associated with significantly worse survival (P=0.02) and liver metastases (P=0.004). In addition, POMC correlated with epithelial-positive circulating tumour cells (P=0.0002). In a panel of SCLC cell lines, all POMC-secreting cell lines expressed cytokeratin (40% of total). Even after cloning, DMS 79 cells expressed both neuroendocrine and epithelial markers. DMS 79 xenografts secreted POMC into the blood, which mirrored the tumour volume. These xenografts expressed both neuroendocrine and epithelial phenotypes in all tumours, with both phenotypes prevalent in cells invading the surrounding tissue.Conclusion:Both neuroendocrine and epithelial phenotypes coexist in human SCLC tumours in vitro and in vivo and this persists in invading tumour cells. In patients, POMC secretion predicts poor survival and liver metastases, suggesting a crucial role of the neuroendocrine phenotype.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 21 March 2013; doi:10.1038/bjc.2013.112 www.bjcancer.com.

Can Damaged Tendons be Repaired using Electrospun Biopolymer Nanofibres?
Title: Can damaged tendons be repaired using electrospun biopolymer nanofibres? Author(s): Lucy A Bosworth, Sandra DownesAffiliation(s): School of Materials, University of Manchester, Grosvenor Street, Manchester, M1 7HS, UKAbstract:Tendon disease and injuries are caused by trauma, sport injuries and orthopaedic pathology.  Current therapies are often ineffective with on-going pain, scarring and tissue degeneration.  With no other synthetic, biodegradable tendon repair device available for clinical use, we have developed an electrospun 3D fibrous scaffold, with purposeful orientation, which mimics the tendon hierarchical tissue structure.Polycaprolactone (PCL) dissolved in acetone was electrospun using pre-determined parameters.  Fibres were collected on a fine-edged mandrel rotating at high speed (aligned fibres) and low speed (random fibres).  3D fibrous bundles were fabricated by manipulating 2D mats of aligned fibres.  Physicochemical characterisation of the three different scaffolds (2D aligned and random mats, and 3D bundles) was performed, including; tensile properties, fibre morphology and crystallinity.  Cellular interactions of tendon cells seeded onto each scaffold were similarly determined by assessing; cell proliferation, contact guidance and matrix expression.  Results determined 3D bundles to have superior tensile properties and, similar to aligned 2D mats, demonstrated cellular orientation comparable to cells within natural tendon.  As a pilot study, 3D bundles were successfully implanted into the Achilles tendons??? of mice for three weeks.  Normal ambulation returned within 48hrs and all mice survived.  Research into longer-term in vivo studies and scaling of single 3D bundles to create hierarchical fibrous structures is currently on-going.  We believe biodegradable 3D electrospun bundles, made from PCL, could provide an alternative therapy for the repair and regeneration of damaged tendons.Biographical statement:Lucy Bosworth is interested in electrospinning applications for tissue regeneration and in vitro models, and is currently continuing her PhD research, ???3D Electrospun Bundles of Polycaprolactone for Tendon Regeneration???, funded by a Proof of Principle grant.

Is Cholesterol Sulfate Deficiency a Common Factor in Preeclampsia, Autism, and Pernicious Anemia?
In a recent paper, we proposed that a contributing factor in autism is a deficiency in cholesterol sulfate supply. In this paper, we investigate a link between preeclampsia and subsequent autism in the child, and we hypothesize that both conditions can be attributed to a severe depletion of cholesterol sulfate. Through studies on the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database, we demonstrate a strong statistical relationship among the signs and symptoms associated with autism and those associated with preeclampsia, pernicious anemia, and serious adverse reactions to vaccines. We show that VAERS reports associated with symptoms typical of pernicious anemia produce both a set of symptoms that are highly correlated with preeclampsia and another set highly correlated with autism. We explain this observation via an argument that, in a severe reaction, the cascade of events subsequent to vaccination reflects a profuse production of nitric oxide (NO) and consequential destruction of both red blood cells (RBCs) and cobalamin. This may explain the diverse signs and symptoms associated with both preeclampsia and severe vaccine adverse reactions. We argue that excess NO synthesis, induced by the aluminum and antigen in vaccines, results in hemolysis of RBCs, which allows hemoglobin to scavenge the excess NO, converting it to nitrate. The NO is also scavenged by cobalamin, leading to its inactivation and contributing to subsequent pernicious anemia. Finally, we demonstrate that severe adverse reactions to vaccines can be associated with life-threatening conditions related to the heart and brain, as well as stillbirth, when the vaccine is administered to a woman in the third-trimester of pregnancy, as demonstrated by statistical analysis of the Gardasil records.

The role of skin substitutes in the management of chronic cutaneous wounds.
Chronic wounds, including diabetic and venous ulcers, represent disruption of normal healing processes resulting in a pathological state of nonhealing cutaneous inflammation. They place an increasingly significant economic burden on healthcare providers as their prevalence is rising in keeping with an aging population. Current treatment modalities are slow acting and resource intensive. Bioengineered skin substitutes from autogenic, allogenic, or xenogenic sources have emerged as a new and alternative therapeutic option. A range of such products is licensed for clinical use, which differ in terms of structure and cellular content. Placed directly onto a prepared wound bed, skin substitutes may stimulate or accelerate healing by promoting revascularization, cellular migration, and repopulation of wound fields through provision of an appropriate scaffold material to facilitate these processes. Products containing fetal or autologous cells also benefit from early release of bioactive molecules including growth factors and cytokines. To date, limited numbers of randomized controlled trials studying skin substitutes have been published but evidence from case series and case-control studies is encouraging. This review discusses chronic wound biology, the influence that skin substitutes can exert on this environment, the products currently available, and examines the evidence for their use in chronic wound management.

p21CIP1 mediates reciprocal switching between proliferation and invasion during metastasis.
Cell proliferation and invasion are critical for malignant progression, yet how these processes relate to each other and whether they regulate one another during metastasis is unknown. We show that invasiveness of breast cancer cells is associated with growth arrest due to p21CIP1 upregulation. Knockdown of p21CIP1 increases cell proliferation and suppresses invasion. Since p21CIP1 acts to inhibit cyclin E during cell-cycle progression, we demonstrated that a constitutively active form of cyclin E had similar effects to p21CIP1 inhibition resulting in enhanced cell growth and suppressed invasiveness. We tested these findings in vivo in the Polyoma middle T mammary tumor model in which p21CIP1 was deleted. p21CIP1 knockout mice exhibited dramatic suppression of metastasis, independent of tumor growth, which was rescued by p21CIP1. Metastasis suppression by p21CIP1 ablation was associated with striking cytoskeletal reorganization leading to a non-invasive and highly proliferative state. Thus, p21CIP1 regulates metastasis by mediating reciprocal switching between invasion and proliferation.

Epigallocatechin-3-gallate inhibits STAT-1 activation and protects cardiac myocytes from ischemia/reperfusion-induced apoptosis.
We have previously demonstrated that STAT-1 plays a critical role in promoting apoptotic cell death in cardiac myocytes following ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major constituent of green tea, has recently been reported to inhibit STAT-1 activity in noncardiac cells. In the present study, we have assessed the protective effects of EGCG and green tea extract (GTE) infusion on both cultures of cardiac myocytes and the isolated rat heart. EGCG reduced STAT-1 phosphorylation and protected cardiac myocytes against I/R-induced apoptotic cell death. Moreover, EGCG reduced the expression of a known STAT-1 pro-apoptotic target gene, Fas receptor. More interestingly, oral administration of GTE as well as EGCG infusion limited the extent of infarct size and attenuated the magnitude of myocyte apoptosis in the isolated rat heart exposed to I/R injury. This reduction cell death was associated with improved hemodynamic recovery and ventricular function in the ischemic/reperfused rat heart. This is the first report to show that consumption of green tea is able to mediate cardioprotection and enhance cardiac function during I/R injury. Because GTE-mediated cardioprotection is achieved, at least in part, through inhibition of STAT-1 activity, we may postulate that a similar action can be implemented in the clinical setting to minimize STAT-1 activation levels in patients with acute coronary artery disease (CAD).

Republished: A systematic literature review of strategies promoting early referral and reducing delays in the diagnosis and management of inflammatory arthritis.
BACKGROUND: Despite the importance of timely management of patients with inflammatory arthritis (IA), delays exist in its diagnosis and treatment. OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic literature review to identify strategies addressing these delays to inform an American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) taskforce. METHODS: The authors searched literature published between January 1985 and November 2010, and ACR and EULAR abstracts between 2007-2010. Additional information was obtained through a grey literature search, a survey conducted through ACR and EULAR, and a hand search of the literature. RESULTS: (1) From symptom onset to primary care, community case-finding strategies, including the use of a questionnaire and autoantibody testing, have been designed to identify patients with early IA. Several websites provided information on IA but were of varying quality and insufficient to aid early referral. (2) At a primary care level, education programmes and patient self-administered questionnaires identified patients with potential IA for referral to rheumatology. Many guidelines emphasised the need for early referral with one providing specific referral criteria. (3) Once referred, early arthritis clinics provided a point of early access for rheumatology assessment. Triage systems, including triage clinics, helped prioritise clinic appointments for patients with IA. Use of referral forms standardised information required, further optimising the triage process. Wait times for patients with acute IA were also reduced with development of rapid access systems. CONCLUSIONS: This review identified three main areas of delay to care for patients with IA and potential solutions for each. A co-ordinated effort will be required by the rheumatology and primary care community to address these effectively.

Probabilistic assignment of formulas to mass peaks in metabolomics experiments
Motivation: High-accuracy mass spectrometry is a popular technology for high-throughput measurements of cellular metabolites (metabolomics). One of the major challenges is the correct identification of the observed mass peaks, including the assignment of their empirical formula, based on the measured mass. Results: We propose a novel probabilistic method for the assignment of empirical formulas to mass peaks in high-throughput metabolomics mass spectrometry measurements. The method incorporates information about possible biochemical transformations between the empirical formulas to assign higher probability to formulas that could be created from other metabolites in the sample. In a series of experiments, we show that the method performs well and provides greater insight than assignments based on mass alone. In addition, we extend the model to incorporate isotope information to achieve even more reliable formula identification. ?? The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press.

Pediatric asthma and development of atopy.
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is ongoing controversy about the relationship between atopy and asthma. RECENT FINDINGS: In clinical practice, specific IgE and skin test results should not be reported as 'positive' or 'negative', but as the level of IgE and the size of skin test wheal diameter. In assessment of children with severe asthma, these tests are not mutually exclusive but complementary, and both should be carried out and quantified. In the near future, their diagnostic accuracy in children with wheezing may be improved by the measurement of allergen-specific IgG. It is becoming increasingly clear that asthma is not a single disease, but a collection of several diseases with similar/same symptoms. These distinct disease entities (endotypes) may share similar observable characteristics (phenotypes), but arise via different pathophysiological mechanisms. Observable phenotypic features (e.g. sputum inflammatory phenotypes) are not stable in children with asthma. The discovery of novel, latent endotypes of asthma will require integration of a time component to take into account the phenotype instability and longitudinal changes. Not only asthma, but also 'atopy' encompasses a number of different endotypes which differ in their association with asthma. SUMMARY: Novel endotypes of atopy and asthma which better reflect the unique pathophysiological processes underlying different diseases in the atopy and asthma syndromes can be defined through the fusion of computational thinking and novel mathematical approaches with biomedical science. These novel endotypes may be more relevant for epidemiological, genetic and therapeutic studies.

Evaluation of the utility of probiotics for the prevention of infections in a model of the skin
Probiotics have been defined as “live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host”. The beneficial effects of probiotics in the gut are well described and roles including immunomodulation and colonisation resistance have been documented. Recent reports suggest that topical use of probiotic bacteria may be an effective strategy to promote skin health or inhibit disease. Therefore, in this thesis the potential of probiotics to protect skin from pathogenic bacteria was assessed using primary keratinocytes as a model system, and the skin pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus. The ability of three probiotics, L. reuteri ATCC 55730, L. rhamnosus AC413 and L. salivarius UCC118 to inhibit the growth of S. aureus was tested using well-diffusion assays and spot on the lawn assays. All three probiotics inhibited the growth of S. aureus in well-diffusion assays, though this property was dependent on growth medium. Inhibition of S. aureus growth was principally via the production of organic acids rather than bacteriocin production. Next, to determine whether probiotics could protect keratinocytes, confluent normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) were infected with S. aureus (106 CFU/ml) in the presence or absence of the probiotic (108 CFU/ml). NHEK viability was measured using trypan blue exclusion assays. L. reuteri had a significant protective effect on NHEK when applied 1h prior to (P=0.0003), or simultaneously with S. aureus (P=0.002). L. reuteri did not however protect NHEK when applied 1h after S. aureus addition. There was no change in the number of viable S. aureus in cell culture assays. To determine whether the protective effect was due to the inhibition of adhesion, NHEK were either pre-exposed to the probiotic for 1h, simultaneously exposed to the probiotic and S. aureus for 1h, or exposed to the probiotic 30 minutes after S. aureus addition for 1h. Pre-exposure of NHEK to L. reuteri (exclusion) and simultaneous exposure to L. reuteri and S. aureus (competition) resulted in significantly less staphylococci adhering to NHEK (P=0.03 and P=0.008 respectively). However when L. reuteri was added after S. aureus (displacement), the number of adherent staphylococci was not reduced. The necessity of S. aureus adherence for the inactivation of NHEK was demonstrated using a α5β1 integrin blocking antibody. Finally, to compare the innate response of NHEK to probiotics with S. capitis and S. aureus, TLR-2, antimicrobial peptide (AMP) expression and IL-8 production were measured. TLR-2 protein (but not mRNA) expression was reduced in the presence of S. aureus (P=0.018). NHEK pre-exposed to S. capitis prior to S. aureus infection however, exhibited elevated TLR-2 protein and mRNA expression (P<0.0001 and P=0.009 respectively). NHEK pre-exposed to L. reuteri prior to S. aureus had no significant change in TLR-2 expression compared to untreated controls. ELISAs demonstrated that IL-8 production was significantly increased in NHEK pre-exposed to L. reuteri prior to S. aureus infection (P=0.0001). In conclusion, L. reuteri protected NHEK from the toxic effects of S. aureus at least partly through competitive exclusion of binding sites on NHEK. Finally, NHEK innate responses to probiotic bacteria were akin to those to the skin commensal, S. capitis. L. reuteri induced expression of a neutrophil chemoattractant, suggesting it could be of importance in priming the innate immune response against S. aureus infections. Taken together, these results suggest that probiotic bacteria could be used prophylactically within skin creams and soaps to prevent S. aureus colonisation and infection in skin.

Topobiology of Human Pigmentation: P-Cadherin Selectively Stimulates Hair Follicle Melanogenesis.
P-cadherin serves as a major topobiological cue in mammalian epithelium. In human hair follicles (HFs), it is prominently expressed in the inner hair matrix that harbors the HF pigmentary unit. However, the role of P-cadherin in normal human pigmentation remains unknown. As patients with mutations in the gene that encodes P-cadherin show hypotrichosis and fair hair, we explored the hypothesis that P-cadherin may control HF pigmentation. When P-cadherin was silenced in melanogenically active organ-cultured human scalp HFs, this significantly reduced HF melanogenesis and tyrosinase activity as well as gene and/or protein expression of gp100, stem cell factor, c-Kit, and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), both in situ and in isolated human HF melanocytes. Instead, epidermal pigmentation was unaffected by P-cadherin knockdown in organ-cultured human skin. In hair matrix keratinocytes, P-cadherin silencing reduced plasma membrane β-catenin, whereas glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) and phospho-β-catenin expression were significantly upregulated. This suggests that P-cadherin-GSK3β/Wnt signaling is required for maintaining the expression of MITF to sustain intrafollicular melanogenesis. Thus, P-cadherin-mediated signaling is a melanocyte subtype-specific topobiological regulator of normal human pigmentation, possibly via GSK3β-mediated canonical Wnt signaling.Journal of Investigative Dermatology advance online publication, 28 February 2013; doi:10.1038/jid.2013.18.

[adhesive, science, biomaterial, function, adhesion, context]

Adhesives and Sealants
In the context of biomaterials, adhesion science and technology assume high importance. It is useful to commence with the slightly wider concept of bonding. It is evident that many biomaterial devices are structured from multiple components, and these need to retain their mutual integrity during clinical service. In this context, the bonds in question may include metallic welds, although these would not be considered within the domain of adhesion, any more than screw attachments that have a role in some implants.The most challenging issue is the creation of a durable interfacial bond between a biomaterial and its host tissue. In addition to the function of bonding, per se, anadhesive biomaterial may be required to fulfil a space-filling role – replacing some or all of any lost natural tissue. In the former case, the function may be termedgrouting. This is, for example, the primary function of bone cements in orthopedics. A further ideal function of an adhesive is that of sealing; that is, the preventionof ingress of moisture, air, biological fluids, bacteria or other species through the adhesively bonded zone.Adhesive is a general term, and in specific contexts may be replaced by designations such as cement, glue, paste, fixative, and bonding agent. Some adhesives may be designed to exhibit further functions, such as antibacterialaction, delivery of drugs or beneficial ions, such as the antibacterial ion Ag+ or fluoride (F−). Fluoride is a component of dental preventative treatments which initiates the partial replacement of hydroxyapatite (HA) – the tooth enamel’s normal crystalline composition – with fluorapatite (a related crystal which incorporates F−).Fluorapatite is more resistant to decay than HA. Sometimes the converse of adhesion, namely abhesion, is necessary in clinical treatment. This “non-stick” feature is required with blood-compatible biomaterials,and is exhibited by non-fouling surfaces covered with polyethylene glycol (PEG).During the past half-century there has been a strong convergence of the ancient technologies of adhesives and the modern science of adhesion – based especiallyon advances in surface science and the understanding of molecular adhesive mechanisms. This progress has been stimulated by widespread industrial uses and biomedical applications of adhesives. The former have been driven by advances in polymer science, and the adoption of lightweight alloy and non-metallic composite materials in the aerospace and automobile industries. Nevertheless, the stringent biomedical requirements for adhesives have led to some specialized developments.The diverse biomedical contexts (host environments) of adhesives each require appropriate materials and techniques. Biological hosts differ principally as to whether they consist of hard or soft tissues. Connected with this are the timescales required for adhesive/bonding durability. These may vary from days, in the case of wound-closure adhesives, to decades of years, in the cases of bonecements and dental restorations. The aim of this chapter is to give a sound introduction to the physico-chemical and materials science aspects of adhesives and sealants, together with a description of current systems utilized ina range of surgical practice. It does not attempt a detailed study of the molecular biological interactions of adhesives.

Managing Burstiness and Scalability in Event-Driven Models on the SpiNNaker Neuromimetic System
Neural networks present a fundamentally different model of computation from the conventional sequential digital model, for which conventional hardware is typically poorly matched. However, a combination of model and scalability limitations has meant that neither dedicated neural chips nor FPGA’s have offered an entirely satisfactory solution. SpiNNaker introduces a different approach, the “neuromimetic” architecture, that maintains the neural optimisation of dedicated chips while offering FPGA-like universal configurability. This parallel multiprocessor employs an asynchronous event-driven model that uses interrupt-generating dedicated hardware on the chip to support real-time neural simulation. Nonetheless, event handling, particularly packet servicing, requires careful and innovative design in order to avoid local processor congestion and possible deadlock. We explore the impact that spatial locality, temporal causality and burstiness of traffic have on network performance, using tunable, biologically similar synthetic traffic patterns. Having established the viability of the system for real-time operation, we use two exemplar neural models to illustrate how to implement efficient event-handling service routines that mitigate the problem of burstiness in the traffic. Extending work published in ACM Computing Frontiers 2010 with on-chip testing, simulation results indicate the viability of SpiNNaker for large-scale neural modelling, while emphasizing the need for effective burst management and network mapping. Ultimately, the goal is the creation of a library-based development system that can translate a high-level neural model from any description environment into an efficient SpiNNaker instantiation. The complete system represents a general-purpose platform that can generate an arbitrary neural network and run it with hardware speed and scale.

Detection and Characterisation of Low-Concentration Components in Drugs and Drug Formulations; Exploring the Value of Soft X-ray Synchrotron Radiation Techniques for the Pharmaceutical Industry
Surface properties affect pharmaceuticals by influencing physical behaviour, which can cause problems for both formulation and medication. Poorly water soluble compounds are often modified with polymer surfactants. The presence of amorphous material, due to its effect on dissolution rate, can modify the bioavailability of a compound. This thesis reports the novel application of X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) and X- ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) to surface related pharmaceutical problems. XAS is sensitive to bond angles, local symmetry and oxidation states and XPS provides information on local chemical environment. Both have a probing depth <10 nm in the soft X-ray range.It is shown that XAS and XPS are capable of determining the physicalcoverage of ultra-thin polymer coatings. In situ XAS confirmed they formraft-like structures on the drug surface. Adsorbed water could also be de-tected on the surface and this corresponds to improvement in dissolutionrate, which implies an improvement in bioavailability. XAS was capableof distinguishing between amorphous and crystalline batches of two drugsat the surface. It was also able to detect a nanoscale amorphous overlayerin predominantly crystalline micronised batches of the drug. High relativehumidity was shown to recrystallise both the amorphous and micronisedbatches. X-ray PhotoElectron Emission Microscopy (XPEEM) of pharma-ceutical compounds was attempted but, due to the higher beamflux required,sample damage and charging effects were too great to draw any meaningfulconclusions at this time.

Inhomogeneous Broadening and the Kosterlitz-Thouless Transition
Torsional-oscillator studies of very thin He-4 films have found nonuniversal behavior of the superfluid response as a function of coverage. The temperature width of the superfluid transition region is nonmonotonic in the areal density n and exhibits cusplike variations at half of the layering period. We explore the assumption that this additional broadening is caused by macroscopic inhomogeneities in the substrate potential; such a theory for inhomogeneous broadening can be constructed from the Kosterlitz-Nelson relation between the superfluid areal density n(s) and the transition temperature T(c) by determining the theoretical ''sensitivity'' S of n(s) to variations in the strength of the substrate potential. For substrate models that are atomically uniform, a simple microscopic hypernetted-chain calculation (without either ''elementary diagrams'' or three-body correlations, but with an optimized Jastrow function) finds this sensitivity always to be of the same sign, and yields reasonable order-of-magnitude agreement with experiment. However, models for which the sensitivity does not change sign appear to be incapable of yielding either the cusps or the half-periodicity of the data. We suggest that these properties may occur with a more recently developed (and more sophisticated) version of hypernetted-chain theory, wherein ''elementary diagrams'' and three-body correlations are incorporated.

Targeted anti-vascular therapies for ovarian cancer: current evidence.
Ovarian cancer presents at advanced stage in around 75% of women, and despite improvements in treatments such as chemotherapy, the 5-year survival from the disease in women diagnosed between 1996 and 1999 in England and Wales was only 36%. Over 80% of patients with advanced ovarian cancer will relapse and despite a good chance of remission from further chemotherapy, they will usually die from their disease. Sequential treatment strategies are employed to maximise quality and length of life but patients eventually become resistant to cytotoxic agents. The expansion in understanding of the molecular biology that characterises cancer cells has led to the rapid development of new agents to target important pathways but the heterogeneity of ovarian cancer biology means that there is no predominant defect. This review attempts to discuss progress to date in tackling a more general target applicable to ovary cancer-angiogenesis.

First we will discuss the 4 operationalized psychodynamic diagnostics (OPD) axes: illness experience and treatment assumptions, relationships, mental conflicts, and structure, then clinical applications will be outlined. Focus psychodynamic formulations can be employed both with inpatients and with outpatients. Studies show good reliability in a research context and acceptable reliability for clinical purposes. Validity will be separately summarized as content, criterion, and construct validity. Validity studies indicate good validity for the individual axes. Numerous studies on the OPD indicate areas of possible improvement, for example for clinical purposes the OPD should be more practically formulated.

Serum cystatin C is independently associated with renal impairment and high sensitivity C-reactive protein in systemic lupus erythematosus.
OBJECTIVES: In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR) is usually estimated using the modiﬁed Cockcroft-Gault (mCG) and Modiﬁcation of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equations. We aimed to study cystatin C (sCysC) in SLE to assess its agreement with standard renal indices and investigate factors affecting sCysC in SLE. METHODS: SLE patients (≥4 ACR criteria) and healthy women from Greater Manchester were recruited and clinical assessments were undertaken. SCysC was measured using R & D Systems' ELISA. Agreement between renal measures was assessed using Deming plots and factors associated with sCysC in SLE were examined by multiple linear regression analyses. RESULTS: 178 patients and 68 controls had median (IQR) ages of 53 (46-61) and 50 (39-60) years, respectively. In an age-adjusted analysis, SLE patients had higher sCysC (1.16 0.98-1.36 vs. 0.950 0.73-1.13 mg/l; p<0.0001) and within SLE those with a history of lupus nephritis had higher sCysC (1.31 1.10-1.66 vs. 1.11 0.95-1.29 mg/l; p<0.005). SCysC correlated positively with serum creatinine, and inversely to renal measures (r=-0.530; p<0.0001 mCG, and r=-0.620; p<0.0001 MDRD). There was closer agreement between the two eGFR measures than between either eGFR measures and sCysC. In addition to age and serum creatinine, a multivariate analysis (β, p) found that high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (0.03, 0.026) was also independently associated with sCysC in SLE. CONCLUSIONS: In SLE, sCysC may be influenced by low grade inﬂammation as well as by renal dysfunction. Therefore, SCysC should not supplant current assessment of renal dysfunction in SLE.

[gradient, transmural, protein, adult, mrna, endocardium, case, apd, change]

Postnatal development of transmural gradients in expression of ion channels and Ca²⁺-handling proteins in the ventricle.
Transmural gradients in myocyte action potential duration (APD) and Ca(2+)-handling proteins are argued to be important for both the normal functioning of the ventricle and arrhythmogenesis. In rabbit, the transmural gradient in APD (left ventricular wedge preparation) is minimal in the neonate. During postnatal development, APD increases both in the epicardium and the endocardium, but the prolongation is more substantial in the endocardium leading to a significant transmural gradient. We have investigated changes in the expression of ion channels and also Ca(2+)-handling proteins in the subepicardial and subendocardial layers of the left ventricular free wall in neonatal (2-7 days of age) and adult male (~6 months of age) New Zealand White rabbits using quantitative PCR and also, when possible, in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry. In the adult, there were significant and substantial transmural gradients in Ca(v)1.2, KChIP2, ERG, K(v)LQT1, K(ir)2.1, NCX1, SERCA2a and RyR2 at the mRNA and, in some cases, protein level-in every case the mRNA or protein was more abundant in the epicardium than the endocardium. Of the eight transmural gradients seen in the adult, only three were observed in the neonate and, in two of these cases, the gradients were smaller than those in the adult. However, in the neonate there were also transmural gradients not observed in the adult: in HCN4, Na(v)1.5, minK, K(ir)3.1 and Cx40 mRNAs - in every case the mRNA was more abundant in the endocardium than the epicardium. If the postnatal changes in ion channel mRNAs are used to predict changes in ionic conductances, mathematical modelling predicts the changes in APD observed experimentally. It is concluded that many of the well known transmural gradients in the ventricle develop postnatally.

Characterizing wave- and current- induced bottom shear stress : U.S. middle Atlantic continental shelf
Waves and currents create bottom shear stress, a force at the seabed that influences sediment texture distribution, micro-topography, habitat, and anthropogenic use. This paper presents a methodology for assessing the magnitude, variability, and driving mechanisms of bottom stress and resultant sediment mobility on regional scales using numerical model output. The analysis was applied to the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB), off the U.S. East Coast, and identified a tidally-dominated shallow region with relatively high stress southeast of Massachusetts over Nantucket Shoals, where sediment mobility thresholds are exceeded over 50% of the time; a coastal band extending offshore to about 30 m water depth dominated by waves, where mobility occurs more than 20% of the time; and a quiescent low stress region southeast of Long Island, approximately coincident with an area of fine-grained sediments called the “Mud Patch”. The regional high in stress and mobility over Nantucket Shoals supports the hypothesis that fine grain sediment winnowed away in this region maintains the Mud Patch to the southwest. The analysis identified waves as the driving mechanism for stress throughout most of the MAB, excluding Nantucket Shoals and sheltered coastal bays where tides dominate; however, the relative dominance of low-frequency events varied regionally, and increased southward toward Cape Hatteras. The correlation between wave stress and local wind stress was lowest in the central MAB, indicating a relatively high contribution of swell to bottom stress in this area, rather than locally generated waves. Accurate prediction of the wave energy spectrum was critical to produce good estimates of bottom shear stress, which was sensitive to energy in the long period waves.This paper is not subject to U.S. copyright.

Retail‘s “New Normal”?: Flexibilisation, De-skilling, and the Social World of Work in an American Hypermart
Beginning in 2003, Hometown Market, Ltd. —one of the largest and traditionally highest-paying retail employers in the formerly industrial town of Flint, Michigan—embarked on a company-wide efficiency campaign to cut costs and re-brand its public image.  These measures were the most drastic set of changes to take place during the company’s 41-year history.  Through its campaign, company leadership downsized managers and hourly workers by the thousands, outsourced in-store operations, amalgamated departments, and all but eliminated full-time hourly work.  In my research based on over 50 interviews and three months of participant-observation, I found that the consequences of labour flexibilisation reverberated in ethnographically palpable ways throughout the social world of the workplace, affecting not only the role and status of workers, but also their relationships to each other and to the work that they do.  This paper suggests that while in some cases workers have responded to de-skilling and the fragmentation of workplace community by generating surprising new forms of social solidarity, overall the cuts have brought about a drastic reduction in job quality.  Ultimately, I suggest that Hometown’s participation in this ‘race to the bottom’ raises serious questions about the inevitability of these changes and the future of blue-collar jobs in deindustrialised America.

Internal carotid artery occlusion in association with Crohn's disease.
A 38-year-old white male with small bowel Crohn's disease presented with an acute right-sided cerebrovascular accident. He died 36 hr later and postmortem revealed thrombosis over the whole length of an otherwise completely normal left internal carotid artery. Histological examination of the artery revealed no abnormalities and in particular no evidence of arteritis. This brings the total number of such cases reported to three, but this is the first with postmortem data. The occurrence of such an event in a young person with normal carotid arteries and no other risk factors would suggest an association with his Crohn's disease, possibly as a result of a coagulation abnormality.

Dynamic Mechanisms of Cell Rigidity Sensing: Insights from a Computational Model of Actomyosin Networks
Cells modulate themselves in response to the surrounding environment like substrate elasticity, exhibiting structural reorganization driven by the contractility of cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton is the scaffolding structure of eukaryotic cells, playing a central role in many mechanical and biological functions. It is composed of a network of actins, actin cross-linking proteins (ACPs), and molecular motors. The motors generate contractile forces by sliding couples of actin filaments in a polar fashion, and the contractile response of the cytoskeleton network is known to be modulated also by external stimuli, such as substrate stiffness. This implies an important role of actomyosin contractility in the cell mechano-sensing. However, how cells sense matrix stiffness via the contractility remains an open question. Here, we present a 3-D Brownian dynamics computational model of a cross-linked actin network including the dynamics of molecular motors and ACPs. The mechano-sensing properties of this active network are investigated by evaluating contraction and stress in response to different substrate stiffness. Results demonstrate two mechanisms that act to limit internal stress: (i) In stiff substrates, motors walk until they exert their maximum force, leading to a plateau stress that is independent of substrate stiffness, whereas (ii) in soft substrates, motors walk until they become blocked by other motors or ACPs, leading to submaximal stress levels. Therefore, this study provides new insights into the role of molecular motors in the contraction and rigidity sensing of cells.

msCompare: A framework for quantitative analysis of label-free LC-MS data for comparative candidate biomarker studies
Data processing forms an integral part of biomarker discovery and contributes significantly to the ultimate result. To compare and evaluate various publicly available open source label-free data processing workflows, we developed msCompare, a modular framework that allows the arbitrary combination of different feature detection/quantification and alignment/matching algorithms in conjunction with a novel scoring method to evaluate their overall performance. We used msCompare to assess the performance of workflows built from modules of publicly available data processing packages such as SuperHirn, OpenMS, and MZmine and our in-house developed modules on peptide-spiked urine and trypsin-digested cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. We found that the quality of results varied greatly among workflows, and interestingly, heterogeneous combinations of algorithms often performed better than the homogenous workflows. Our scoring method showed that the union of feature matrices of different workflows outperformed the original homogenous workflows in some cases. msCompare is open source software (https://trac.nbic.nl/ mscompare), and we provide a web-based data processing service for our framework by integration into the Galaxy server of the Netherlands Bioinformatics Center (http://galaxy.nbic.nl/galaxy) to allow scientists to determine which combination of modules provides the most accurate processing for their particular LC-MS data sets.

We show that previous influenza virus infection of mice: (a) protects against weight loss, illness, and lung eosinophilia; (b) attenuates recruitment of inflammatory cells; and (c) reduces cytokine secretion caused by RSV attachment protein without affecting RSV clearance. This protective effect can be transferred via influenza-immune splenocytes to naive mice and is long lived. Previous immunity to lung infection clearly plays an important and underestimated role in subsequent vaccination and infection. The data have important implications for the timing of vaccinations in certain patient groups, and may contribute to variability in disease susceptibility observed in humans.

Formation and characterization of carbon nanowires
<p>This article reports on the formation and electronic characteristics of conducting carbon nanowires produced by swift heavy ion irradiation of a fullerene thin film. This study shows that it is possible to create arrays of carbon nanowires, which are perfectly parallel to each other and perpendicular to the substrate. As-deposited fullerene films exhibit poor field emission characteristics with breakdown fields as high as 51 V/mu m, whereas low dose ion irradiated fullerene film produces a threshold field as low as 9 V/mu m. The present approach of making conducting carbon nanowires by ion irradiation for potential field emitters and large area applications is also discussed.</p>

A randomized, double-blind study comparing the effects of beclomethasone and fluticasone on bone density over two years.
Cross-sectional studies have suggested that asthmatic patients receiving high dose inhaled corticosteroids and intermittent courses of oral corticosteroids have reduced bone mass. This prospective 2-yr study was undertaken to evaluate changes in bone density of patients receiving high doses of inhaled corticosteroids. Patients (n = 33) (males aged 18-50 yrs, females aged 18-40 yrs) on inhaled corticosteroids 1,000-2,000 microg x day(-1), were randomized in a double-blind fashion to either fluticasone propionate (FP) 1,000 microg x day(-1) or beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) 2,000 microg x day(-1). In parallel, three open control groups of the same age range were studied: asthmatics (n = 8) receiving low dose inhaled corticosteroids (< or =400 microg x day(-1)) (group A); chronic, severe asthmatics (n = 8) receiving oral corticosteroids (> or =10 mg x day(-1) (group B); and healthy untreated volunteers (n = 7) (group C). Bone densitometry scans (quantitative computed tomography (QCT) of spine; dual X-ray absorptiometry of spine, femoral neck, and single photon absorptiometry of forearm) were performed at baseline and after 6, 12 and 24 months of treatment. Biochemical bone marker measurements (serum osteocalcin, bone alkaline phosphatase, pro-collagen type 1 carboxy terminal propeptide, deoxypyridinoline and C-telopeptide of type 1 collagen) were collected every 3 months. Fifteen FP (mean age 36 yrs, six male) and 9 BDP patients (mean age 33 yrs, five male); completed the study. At 0 months, mean bone mineral density (BMD) was lower in patients receiving inhaled corticosteroids (both low dose and high dose) than in normal volunteers. In the FP-treated group, mean vertebral trabecular BMD quantitative computed tomography remained stable with no evidence of decline, whereas there was some decline in the BDP-treated group. The treatment difference between FP and BDP was statistically significant in favour of FP for quantitative computed tomography measurements after 12 months (p = 0.006) and 24 months (p = 0.004). This study suggests that over 24 months, changes in bone density are minimal in patients on high-dose inhaled corticosteroids.

[signalling, role, cell, purinergic, nervous, neurotransmitter, atp, disease, astroglial, system]

Pathophysiology of astroglial purinergic signalling.
Astrocytes are fundamental for central nervous system (CNS) physiology and are the fulcrum of neurological diseases. Astroglial cells control development of the nervous system, regulate synaptogenesis, maturation, maintenance and plasticity of synapses and are central for nervous system homeostasis. Astroglial reactions determine progression and outcome of many neuropathologies and are critical for regeneration and remodelling of neural circuits following trauma, stroke, ischaemia or neurodegenerative disorders. They secrete multiple neurotransmitters and neurohormones to communicate with neurones, microglia and the vascular walls of capillaries. Signalling through release of ATP is the most widespread mean of communication between astrocytes and other types of neural cells. ATP serves as a fast excitatory neurotransmitter and has pronounced long-term (trophic) roles in cell proliferation, growth, and development. During pathology, ATP is released from damaged cells and acts both as a cytotoxic factor and a proinflammatory mediator, being a universal "danger" signal. In this review, we summarise contemporary knowledge on the role of purinergic receptors (P2Rs) in a variety of diseases in relation to changes of astrocytic functions and nucleotide signalling. We have focussed on the role of the ionotropic P2X and metabotropic P2YRs working alone or in concert to modify the release of neurotransmitters, to activate signalling cascades and to change the expression levels of ion channels and protein kinases. All these effects are of great importance for the initiation, progression and maintenance of astrogliosis-the conserved and ubiquitous glial defensive reaction to CNS pathologies. We highlighted specific aspects of reactive astrogliosis, especially with respect to the involvement of the P2X(7) and P2Y(1)R subtypes. Reactive astrogliosis exerts both beneficial and detrimental effects in a context-specific manner determined by distinct molecular signalling cascades. Understanding the role of purinergic signalling in astrocytes is critical to identifying new therapeutic principles to treat acute and chronic neurological diseases.

A European multicentre PET study of fibrillar amyloid in Alzheimer's disease.
PURPOSE: Amyloid PET tracers have been developed for in vivo detection of brain fibrillar amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To serve as an early biomarker in AD the amyloid PET tracers need to be analysed in multicentre clinical studies. METHODS: In this study 238 (11)CPittsburgh compound-B (PIB) datasets from five different European centres were pooled. Of these 238 datasets, 18 were excluded, leaving (11)CPIB datasets from 97 patients with clinically diagnosed AD (mean age 69 ± 8 years), 72 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; mean age 67.5 ± 8 years) and 51 healthy controls (mean age 67.4 ± 6 years) available for analysis. Of the MCI patients, 64 were longitudinally followed for 28 ± 15 months. Most participants (175 out of 220) were also tested for apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype. RESULTS: (11)CPIB retention in the neocortical and subcortical brain regions was significantly higher in AD patients than in age-matched controls. Intermediate (11)CPIB retention was observed in MCI patients, with a bimodal distribution (64 % MCI PIB-positive and 36 % MCI PIB-negative), which was significantly different the pattern in both the AD patients and controls. Higher (11)CPIB retention was observed in MCI ApoE ε4 carriers compared to non-ApoE ε4 carriers (p < 0.005). Of the MCI PIB-positive patients, 67 % had converted to AD at follow-up while none of the MCI PIB-negative patients converted. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the robustness of (11)CPIB PET as a marker of neocortical fibrillar amyloid deposition in brain when assessed in a multicentre setting. MCI PIB-positive patients showed more severe memory impairment than MCI PIB-negative patients and progressed to AD at an estimated rate of 25 % per year. None of the MCI PIB-negative patients converted to AD, and thus PIB negativity had a 100 % negative predictive value for progression to AD. This supports the notion that PIB-positive scans in MCI patients are an indicator of prodromal AD.

[pathway, innate, classical, bacterial, immunity, complement, response, component, pathogen, igm]

The classical pathway is the dominant complement pathway required for innate immunity to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection in mice.
The complement system is an important component of the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae. The classical complement pathway is activated by antibody-antigen complexes on the bacterial surface and has been considered predominately to be an effector of the adaptive immune response, whereas the alternative and mannose-binding lectin pathways are activated directly by bacterial cell surface components and are considered effectors of the innate immune response. Recently, a role has been suggested for the classical pathway during innate immunity that is activated by natural IgM or components of the acute-phase response bound to bacterial pathogens. However, the functional importance of the classical pathway for innate immunity to S. pneumoniae and other bacterial pathogens, and its relative contribution compared with the alternative and mannose-binding lectin pathways has not been defined. By using strains of mice with genetic deficiencies of complement components and secretory IgM we have investigated the role of each complement pathway and natural IgM for innate immunity to S. pneumoniae. Our results show that the proportion of a population of S. pneumoniae bound by C3 depends mainly on the classical pathway, whereas the intensity of C3 binding depends on the alternative pathway. Furthermore, the classical pathway, partially targeted by the binding of natural IgM to bacteria, is the dominant pathway for activation of the complement system during innate immunity to S. pneumoniae, loss of which results in rapidly progressing septicemia and impaired macrophage activation. These data demonstrate the vital role of the classical pathway for innate immunity to a bacterial pathogen.

Negative impact of Aspergillus galactomannan and DNA detection in the diagnosis of fungal rhinosinusitis.
A proportion of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, especially if nasal polyps are present, have a diagnosis of fungal rhinosinusitis. The diagnosis is difficult to establish because the symptoms and clinical and radiological signs are non-specific. Also current diagnostic methods, i.e. histology, fungal staining and culture, are insensitive. The performance of the Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) ELISA and real-time PCR for Aspergillus fumigatus mitochondrial DNA was evaluated for the detection of Aspergillus in sinus mucus samples from 25 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. The results were compared with those from nasal lavage fluid from 19 healthy volunteers. Seven patients (28 %) were diagnosed as having fungal rhinosinusitis according to the presence of filaments in histology or direct microscopy using Calcofluor white. All fungal rhinosinusitis patients were negative in the GM ELISA. GM ELISA was positive in five patients whose samples were negative using conventional methods and A. fumigatus PCR. Two out of seven patients with fungal rhinosinusitis were positive by A. fumigatus PCR: one also had a positive A. fumigatus culture, and one had hyphae consistent with Aspergillus in histology. One additional patient had a weak positive PCR result, but other fungal tests were negative. In control subjects, the GM ELISA was positive in 21 %, whereas direct microscopy, culture and A. fumigatus PCR were negative in all samples. Direct microscopy and culture together with histology remain pivotal in defining fungal rhinosinusitis diagnosis. A. fumigatus PCR may have additional value in allowing the diagnosis to be made sooner, whereas the GM ELISA is not reliable in diagnosing Aspergillus infection of the paranasal sinuses.

Real Option Analysis in Resilient Energy Networks
The resilience of future power systems are being challenged in three fronts: (i) decarbonising energy supply will alter supply mix; (ii) shift of previous non-electric demand onto the energy network will require the system to work at higher capacity; and (iii) expected changes in climate will alter demand and performance of electrical network components. This thesis quantitatively assesses the impact of future climate change on the resilience of a power system, in secure and hazardous conditions. This is done through the use of reliability indices and probabilistic security assessment. Dynamical thermal ratings of circuits are used throughout this thesis given their potential for increased capacity over the standard static ratings. The first finding is that the predicted future climate scenarios will result in components with lower thermal ratings then if used currently. Due to this, it is found that the reliability of the system decreases under further climate scenarios. In order to keep a satisfactory level of reliability in the system, a method of temporary overloaded circuits is introduced which doesn't result in a higher risk of component failure. The temporary overload method allows for the rating constraint to be violated provided the temperature constraint isn't. Applying this to the system, and assessing the results under various climate scenarios, it is found that the method is beneficial in terms of economical cost and system reliability. When applied to hazardous conditions, it is found the method has a higher potential to strengthen the reliability of the system in comparison to when used on the 'safe' system.An approach is taken to aid the system operator in decision making under uncertain conditions. A scenario is devised in which an operator wants to plan the power dispatch for a future time period. This is done through the use of stochastic optimisation, where the uncertainty is encapsulated by the conductor ratings which are calculated using dynamical thermal ratings in which the weather parameters are stochastic. This is developed for a one and two period model, in which the two period model has the first and second period coupled through the addition of a ramp rate constraint in the optimisation. System adequacy indices and probabilistic security indices are added as constraints so the system operator can control the reliability of his system.

The Use of Whole Genome Amplification to Study Chromosomal Changes in Prostate Cancer: Insights into Genome-Wide Signature of Preneoplasia Associated with Cancer Progression
<p>Background: Prostate cancer (CaP) is a disease with multifactorial etiology that includes both genetic and environmental components. The knowledge of the genetic basis of CaP has increased over the past years, mainly in the pathways that underlie tumourigenesis, progression and drug resistance. The vast majority of cases of CaP are adenocarcinomas that likely develop through a pre-malignant lesion and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HPIN). Histologically, CaP is a heterogeneous disease consisting of multiple, discrete foci of invasive carcinoma and HPIN that are commonly interspersed with benign glands and stroma. This admixture with benign tissue can complicate genomic analyses in CaP. Specifically, when DNA is bulk- extracted the genetic information obtained represents an average for all of the cells within the sample. Results: To minimize this problem, we obtained DNA from individual foci of HPIN and CaP by laser capture microdissection ( LCM). The small quantities of DNA thus obtained were then amplified by means of multiple-displacement amplification (MDA), for use in genomic DNA array comparative genomic hybridisation (gaCGH). Recurrent chromosome copy number abnormalities (CNAs) were observed in both HPIN and CaP. In HPIN, chromosomal imbalances involving chromosome 8 where common, whilst in CaP additional chromosomal changes involving chromosomes 6, 10, 13 and 16 where also frequently observed. Conclusion: An overall increase in chromosomal changes was seen in CaP compared to HPIN, suggesting a universal breakdown in chromosomal stability. The accumulation of CNAs, which occurs during this process is non- random and may indicate chromosomal regions important in tumourigenesis. It is therefore likely that the alterations in copy number are part of a programmed cycle of events that promote tumour development, progression and survival. The combination of LCM, MDA and gaCGH is ideally suited for the identification of CNAs from small cell clusters and may assist in the discovery of potential genomic markers for early diagnosis, or identify the location of tumour suppressor genes (TSG) or oncogenes previously unreported in HPIN and CaP.</p>

[infection, chronic, bacterial, immune]

Chronic bacterial infections: living with unwanted guests.
Some bacterial pathogens can establish life-long chronic infections in their hosts. Persistence is normally established after an acute infection period involving activation of both the innate and acquired immune systems. Bacteria have evolved specific pathogenic mechanisms and harbor sets of genes that contribute to the establishment of a persistent lifestyle that leads to chronic infection. Persistent bacterial infection may involve occupation of a particular tissue type or organ or modification of the intracellular environment within eukaryotic cells. Bacteria appear to adapt their immediate environment to favor survival and may hijack essential immunoregulatory mechanisms designed to minimize immune pathology or the inappropriate activation of immune effectors.

Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and related allergic syndromes.
While allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is well recognized as a fungal complication of asthma, severe asthma with fungal sensitization (SAFS) is not. In ABPA the total immunoglobulin E (IgE) is usually >1,000 IU/mL, whereas in SAFS it is <1,000 IU/mL, and either skin prick tests or fungus-specific IgE tests are positive. ABPA may present with any severity of asthma, and occasionally with no asthma or cystic fibrosis, the other common underlying disease. SAFS is a problem in patients with poorly controlled asthma and occasionally presents in the intensive care unit (ICU). Production of mucous plugs and coughing paroxysms is more common in ABPA. Certain underlying genetic defects seem to underpin these remarkable phenotypic differences. From a management perspective both ABPA and SAFS respond to both high doses of corticosteroids and oral antifungal agents, with ∼60% response rate in both ABPA and SAFS with itraconazole. In 50% of patients itraconazole boosts inhaled corticosteroid exposure, sometimes leading to cushingoid features. Second-line therapy data are scant, but we have shown that 70 to 80% of patients who tolerate either voriconazole or posaconazole also respond. Other useful therapies include nebulized hypertonic saline to aid expectoration of thick sputum and long-term azithromycin for its anti-inflammatory effect on the airways. Omaluzimab is useful in some patients with SAFS and occasionally in ABPA. Complications of ABPA include bronchiectasis, typically central in distribution, and chronic pulmonary aspergillosis. Most patients with ABPA and SAFS can be stabilized for long periods with inhaled corticosteroids and itraconazole or another antifungal agent. Novel immunotherapies are on the horizon.

When using a consistent set of physical inputs the deduced spectroscopic factors are consistent to within 15% for incident deuteron energies from 12 to 60 MeV. By contrast, original analyses of many of these data quoted spectroscopic factors that differed by up to a factor of 5. The present analysis provides an important reference point from which to assess the requirements of future spectroscopic analyses of transfer reactions measured in inverse kinematics using rare nuclei.</p>

Subchronic effects of phencyclidine on dopamine and serotonin receptors: implications for schizophrenia.
Changes in representative dopamine (D(1), D(2), and D(4)) and serotonin (5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A)) receptors that have been implicated in the pathophysiology and treatment of schizophrenia were autoradiographically quantified after subchronic phencyclidine (PCP) treatment (2 mg/kg for 7 days, bi-daily followed by 7 days drug free). This treatment has consistently induced robust and long-lasting cognitive deficits in adult rats, although the molecular mechanisms contributing to PCP-induced cognitive deficits remain undefined. Repeated PCP treatment significantly decreased labeling of D(1) receptors in the medial and lateral caudate-putamen (22% and 23%, respectively) and increased 5HT(1A) receptor binding in the medial-prefrontal (26%) and dorsolateral-frontal cortex (30%). No changes in D(1) or 5HT(1A) receptors were detected in other brain regions. These findings suggest that downregulation of striatal D(1) receptors and upregulation of cortical 5HT(1A) receptors may contribute to PCP-induced impairment of cognitive functions in rats. Subchronic PCP treatment did not alter levels of D(2), D(4), and 5HT(2A) receptors in all brain regions examined, which suggests a minimal role for these receptors in mediating subchronic actions of PCP in adult rats.

Since the discovery that neural tissue contains a population of stem cells that form neurospheres in vitro, sphere-forming assays have been adapted for use with a number of different tissue types for the quantification of stem cell activity and self-renewal. One tissue type widely used for stem cell investigations is mammary tissue, and the mammosphere assay has been used in both normal tissue and cancer. Although it is a relatively simple assay to learn, it can be difficult to master. There are methodological and analytical aspects to the assay which require careful consideration when interpreting the results. We describe here a detailed mammosphere assay protocol for the assessment of stem cell activity and self-renewal, and discuss how data generated by the assay can be analysed and interpreted.

Optimized methods for imaging membrane nanotubes between T cells and trafficking of HIV-1.
A wide variety of cell types, including immune cells, have been observed to frequently interact via transient, long-distance membrane connections. However, considerable heterogeneity in their structure, mode of formation and functional properties has emerged, suggesting the existence of distinct subclasses. Open-ended tunneling nanotubes allow for the trafficking of cytoplasmic material, e.g. endocytic vesicles, or the transmission of calcium signals. Closed-ended membrane nanotubes do not seamlessly connect the cytoplasm between two interacting cells and a junction exists within the nanotube or where the nanotube meets a cell body. Recent live cell imaging suggested that membrane nanotubes between T cells could present a novel route for HIV-1 transmission. Here, we describe detailed protocols for observing membrane nanotubes and HIV-1 trafficking by live cell fluorescence microscopy.

5-HTTLPR and STin2 polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter gene and irritable bowel syndrome: effect of bowel habit and sex.
BACKGROUND: Conflicting data exist on the association between functional polymorphisms in the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) gene (SLC6A4) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This may be partly because of small participant numbers and varying ethnic origin and sex within the cohorts studied. AIM: To reassess the potential association between the SERT polymorphisms 5-HTTLPR and STin2 in both male and female IBS patients with diarrhoea (IBS-D) and constipation (IBS-C) compared with healthy volunteers. METHODS: In this case-control study, 196 Caucasian Rome II IBS patients 97 IBS-D (aged 18-66 years; 67 female) and 99 IBS-C (aged 18-65 years; 95 female) and 92 Caucasian healthy volunteers (aged 18-63 years; 60 female) from the UK had genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood and the 5-HTTLPR and STin2 polymorphisms genotyped. RESULTS: The frequency of the 5-HTTLPR (ss) genotype was slightly lower in both IBS-D (16.5%) and IBS-C (14.3%) patients compared with controls (23.9%), although not significantly (P<or=0.191). This seemed to be related to a reduction in the frequency of the 5-HTTLPR (ss) genotype in male patients, particularly those with IBS-D IBS-D 10%, IBS-C 25%, controls 37.5%; P=0.01 for IBS-D vs. controls; odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for 5-HTTLPR (ss) vs. 5-HTTLPR (non-ss)=0.185 (0.046-0.744) than in female patients (IBS-D 19.4%, IBS-C 13.8%, controls 16.7%). There were no differences in the frequencies of either the 5-HTTLPR (ll) or (ls), or STin2 genotypes between any of the three groups. CONCLUSION: Our finding that male IBS-D patients have a reduced frequency of the 5-HTTLPR (ss) genotype contradicts three earlier studies of a similar size, which did not take sex into account. Therefore, replication studies in even larger cohorts, stratifying for sex and endophenotypes, after assessing physiological and psychological traits, are required to unravel the contribution of SERT polymorphisms to the IBS phenotype.

Stationary-phase production of the antibiotic actinorhodin in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) is transcriptionally regulated
Production of actinorhodin, a polyketide antibiotic made by Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), normally occurs only in stationary-phase cultures. S1 nuclease protection experiments showed that transcription of actII-ORF4, the activator gene required for expression of the biosynthetic structural genes, increased dramatically during the transition from exponential to stationary phase. The increase in actII-ORF4 expression was followed by transcription of the biosynthetic structural genes actIII and actVI-ORF1, and by the production of actinorhodin. The presence of actII-RF4 on a multicopy plasmid resulted in enhanced levels of actII-ORF4 mRNA, and transcription of actIII and actinorhodin production during exponential growth, suggesting that actinorhodin synthesis in rapidly growing cultures is normally limited only by the availability of enough of the activator protein. bldA, which encodes a tRNA(UUA)(LEU) that is required for the efficient translation of a single UUA codon in the actII-ORF4 mRNA, was transcribed throughout growth. Moreover, translational fusions of the 5' end of actII-ORF4 that included the UUA codon to the ermE reporter gene demonstrated the presence of functional bldA tRNA in young, exponentially growing cultures and no increase in the efficiency of translation of UUA codons, relative to UUG codons, was observed during growth. The normal growth-phase-dependent production of actinorhodin in the liquid culture conditions used in these experiments appears to be mediated at the transcriptional level through activation of the actII-ORF4 promoter.

Electrical stimulation in bone healing: critical analysis by evaluating levels of evidence.
Objectives: Direct current, capacitive coupling, and inductive coupling are modes of electrical stimulation (ES) used to enhance bone healing. It is important to assess the effectiveness of ES for bone healing to ensure optimization for clinical practice. This review aims to examine the level of evidence (LOE) for the application of ES to enhance bone healing and investigate the proposed mechanism for its stimulatory effect. Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE searches were conducted to identify clinical and in vitro studies utilizing ES for bone healing since 1959. A total of 105 clinical studies and 35 in vitro studies were evaluated. Clinical studies were assigned LOE according to Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine (LOE-1, highest; LOE-5, lowest). Results: Direct current was found to be effective in enhancing bone healing in spinal fusion but only LOE-4 supported its use for nonunions. Eleven studies were retrieved for capacitive coupling with LOE-1 demonstrating its effectiveness for treating nonunions. The majority of studies utilized inductive coupling with LOE-1 supporting its application for healing osteotomies and nonunions. In vitro studies demonstrate that ES enhances bone healing by changes in growth factors and transmembrane signaling although no clear mechanism has been defined. Conclusion: Overall, the studies, although in favor of ES application in bone repair, displayed variability in treatment regime, primary outcome measures, follow-up times, and study design, making critical evaluation and assessment difficult. Electrical stimulation shows promise in enhancement of bone healing; however, better-designed clinical studies will enable the optimization for clinical practice.

[infection, pulmonary]

Amelioration of influenza-induced pathology in mice by coinfection with Trichinella spiralis.
Illness due to respiratory virus infection is often induced by excessive infiltration of cells into pulmonary tissues, leading to airway occlusion. We show here that infection with Trichinella spiralis results in lower levels of tumor necrosis factor in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and inhibits cellular recruitment into the airways of mice coinfected with influenza A virus. Infiltration of neutrophils and CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes was reduced, resulting in animals gaining weight more rapidly following the initial phase of infection. Influenza resulted in a generalized increase in vascular permeability in pulmonary tissues, and this was suppressed by parasite infection, although the effects were restricted to the early phase of trichinosis. Moreover, the number of cells producing interleukin-10 (IL-10), and the local levels of this cytokine, were reduced, suggesting that amelioration of pulmonary pathology by parasite infection occurs independently of IL-10 production.

Comparison of the performance of tracer kinetic model-driven registration for dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) using different models of contrast enhancement
Rationale and Objectives. The quantitative analysis of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) data is subject to model fitting errors caused by motion during the time-series data acquisition. However, the timevaryingfeatures that occur as a result of contrast enhancement can confound motion correction techniques based on conventionalregistration similarity measures. We have therefore developed a heuristic, locally controlled tracer kinetic modeldrivenregistration procedure, in which the model accounts for contrast enhancement, and applied it to the registration ofabdominal DCE-MRI data at high temporal resolution.Materials and Methods. Using severely motion-corrupted data sets that had been excluded from analysis in a clinicaltrial of an antiangiogenic agent, we compared the results obtained when using different models to drive the tracer kinetic modeldrivenregistration with those obtained when using a conventional registration against the time series mean image volume.Results. Using tracer kinetic model-driven registration, it was possible to improve model fitting by reducing the sum ofsquared errors but the improvement was only realized when using a model that adequately described the features of thetime series data. The registration against the time series mean significantly distorted the time series data, as did tracerkinetic model-driven registration using a simpler model of contrast enhancement.Conclusion. When an appropriate model is used, tracer kinetic model-driven registration influences motion-corrupted modelfit parameter estimates and provides significant improvements in localization in three-dimensional parameter maps. This has positiveimplications for the use of quantitative DCE-MRI for example in clinical trials of antiangiogenic or antivascular agents.Key Words.

Mucosal delivery of a respiratory syncytial virus CTL peptide with enterotoxin-based adjuvants elicits protective, immunopathogenic, and immunoregulatory antiviral CD8+ T cell responses.
In an effort to develop a safe and effective vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), we used Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin (LT), and LTK63 (an LT mutant devoid of ADP-ribosyltransferase activity) to elicit murine CD8(+) CTL responses to an intranasally codelivered CTL peptide from the second matrix protein (M2) of RSV. M2(82-90)-specific CD8(+) T cells were detected by IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot and (51)Cr release assay in local and systemic lymph nodes, and their induction was dependent on the use of a mucosal adjuvant. CTL elicited by peptide immunization afforded protection against RSV challenge, but also enhanced weight loss. CTL-mediated viral clearance was not dependent on IFN-gamma since depletion using specific mAb during RSV challenge did not affect cellular recruitment or viral clearance. Depletion of IFN-gamma did, however, reduce the concentration of TNF detected in lung homogenates of challenged mice and largely prevented the weight loss associated with CTL-mediated viral clearance. Mice primed with the attachment glycoprotein (G) develop lung eosinophilia after intranasal RSV challenge. Mucosal peptide vaccination reduced pulmonary eosinophilia in mice subsequently immunized with G and challenged with RSV. These studies emphasize that protective and immunoregulatory CD8(+) CTL responses can be mucosally elicited using enterotoxin-based mucosal adjuvants but that resistance against viral infection may be accompanied by enhanced disease.

Polarity-Dependent Forming in Ion Bombarded Amorphous Silicon Memory Devices
<p>Polarity-dependent forming in ion bombarded metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) memory devices of hydrogenated amorphous silicon is reported. It is shown that prior to ion bombardment, current transport in the MSM devices is asymmetric and is controlled by the Schottky barriers at two MS junctions. Upon bombardment, however, there is a bulk component to the current and the I-V characteristics of the devices become symmetric at low bias voltages. The forming voltage in the bombarded devices shows polarity dependence. For positive bias applied on the top contact, we find that devices form at the same electric field independent of the thickness of the amorphous silicon while for negative voltage on the top contact, the electric field needed for forming increases with the thickness. A model involving the difference in energy deposition and heat sinking for the two polarities is proposed</p>

[astrocyte, loss, disease, neuron]

Neurological diseases as primary gliopathies: a reassessment of neurocentrism.
Diseases of the human brain are almost universally attributed to malfunction or loss of nerve cells. However, a considerable amount of work has, during the last decade, expanded our view on the role of astrocytes in CNS (central nervous system), and this analysis suggests that astrocytes contribute to both initiation and propagation of many (if not all) neurological diseases. Astrocytes provide metabolic and trophic support to neurons and oligodendrocytes. Here, we shall endeavour a broad overviewing of the progress in the field and forward the idea that loss of homoeostatic astroglial function leads to an acute loss of neurons in the setting of acute insults such as ischaemia, whereas more subtle dysfunction of astrocytes over periods of months to years contributes to epilepsy and to progressive loss of neurons in neurodegenerative diseases. The majority of therapeutic drugs currently in clinical use target neuronal receptors, channels or transporters. Future therapeutic efforts may benefit by a stronger focus on the supportive homoeostatic functions of astrocytes.

Energy pathways and structures of oceanic eddies from the ECCO2 state estimate and simplified models
Studying oceanic eddies is important for understanding and predicting ocean circulation
and climate variability. The central focus of this dissertation is the energy
exchange between eddies and mean flow and banded structures in the low-frequency
component of the eddy  field. A combination of a realistic eddy-permitting ocean
state estimate and simplified theoretical models is used to address the following specific questions. (1) What are the major spatial characteristics of eddy-mean 
flow interaction from an energy perspective? Is eddy-mean flow interaction a local process
in most ocean regions? (2) The banded structures in the low-frequency eddy  field are
termed striations. How much oceanic variability is associated with striations? How
does the time-mean circulation, for example a subtropical gyre or constant mean 
flow, influence the origin and characteristics of striations? How much do striations
contribute to the energy budget and tracer mixing?Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution February 2013This research was supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration

[dtic, patient, response, administration, month, treatment, fotemustine, rate]

Sequential administration of varying doses of dacarbazine and fotemustine in advanced malignant melanoma.
There is increasing experimental evidence to suggest that expression of O6-alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase (ATase) is a major factor in resistance to dacarbazine (DTIC). We recently demonstrated a progressive ATase depletion in human peripheral lymphocytes with nadir levels occurring at 4-6 h after DTIC administration (Lee et al., 1991). Therefore in an attempt to improve the clinical response rate of DTIC, fotemustine was administered 4 h after DTIC administration; since in the case of fotemustine, ATase removes the chloroethyl lesions from the O6-position of guanine, thereby preventing the formation of the cytotoxic cross-links. Sixty patients with widely metastatic melanoma received DTIC at 400, 500 or 800 mg m-2 followed by fotemustine (100 mg m-1) at 4 h after DTIC administration. Treatment was repeated every 28 days with a total of 169 cycles of chemotherapy administered; 75, 57 and 37 treatment cycles with 400, 500 and 800 mg m-2 DTIC groups respectively. Eighteen of the 60 patients responded (with three complete response); response rates were linearly related to dose, being 24%, 30% and 40% in patients receiving 400, 500 and 800 mg m-2 of DTIC respectively and the overall response rate was 30%. Median survival was 3.6 months (range, 1-15 months) with no statistically significant difference between the different DTIC treatment groups (P = 0.67). Nine patients are alive at 5 to 26 months (median 10 months); three patients with no tumour and five patients with stable disease. A statistically significant relationship was seen between the development of severe haematological toxicity (WHO > or = 3) with increasing dosage of DTIC and significant subclinical pulmonary damage was seen in 11 patients where the lung function was monitored during the course of treatment. In conclusion, it appears that with this small group of patients, escalation of DTIC dosage might not significantly affect response rates but does increase haematological toxicity. The present study provides a framework for other studies in an attempt to modulate ATase-mediated drug resistance in tumour tissues but the associated toxicity will need careful monitoring.

Pharmacodynamics of voriconazole in a dynamic in vitro model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis: implications for in vitro susceptibility breakpoints.
BACKGROUND: Voriconazole is a first-line agent for the treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). There are increasing reports of Aspergillus fumigatus isolates with reduced susceptibility to voriconazole. METHODS: An in vitro dynamic model of IPA was developed that enabled simulation of human-like voriconazole pharmacokinetics. Galactomannan was used as a biomarker. The pharmacodynamics of voriconazole against wild-type and 3 resistant strains of A. fumigatus were defined. The results were bridged to humans to provide decision support for setting breakpoints for voriconazole using Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and European Committee of Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) methodologies. RESULTS: Isolates with higher minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) required higher area under the concentration time curves (AUCs) to achieve suppression of galactomannan. Using CLSI and EUCAST methodologies, the AUC:MIC values that achieved suppression of galactomannan were 55 and 32.1, respectively. Using CLSI and EUCAST methodologies, the trough concentration:MIC values that achieved suppression of galactomannan were 1.68 and 1, respectively. Potential CLSI breakpoints for voriconazole are ≤ 0.5 mg/L for susceptible and >1 mg/L for resistant. Potential EUCAST breakpoints for voriconazole are ≤1 mg/L for susceptible and >2 mg/L for resistant. CONCLUSIONS: This dynamic model of IPA is a useful tool to address many remaining questions related to antifungal treatment of Aspergillus spp.

[clozapine, drug, antipsychotic, sga, schizophrenia, advantage]

Randomized controlled trial of effect of prescription of clozapine versus other second-generation antipsychotic drugs in resistant schizophrenia
There is good evidence that clozapine is more efficacious than first-generation antipsychotic drugs in resistant schizophrenia. It is less clear if clozapine is more effective than the other second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) drugs. A noncommercially funded, pragmatic, open, multisite, randomized controlled trial was conducted in the United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS). Participantswere 136 people aged 18–65 with DSM-IV schizophrenia and related disorders whose medication was being changed because of poor clinical response to 2 or more previous antipsychotic drugs. Participants were randomly allocated to clozapine or to one of the class of other SGA drugs (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, amisulpride) as selected by the managing clinician. Outcomes were assessed blind to treatment allocation. One-year assessments were carried out in 87% of the sample. The intent to treat comparison showed no statistically significant advantage for commencing clozapine in Quality of Life score (3.63 points; CI: 0.46–7.71; p = .08) but did show an advantage in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score that was statistically significant (–4.93 points; CI: -8.82 to -1.05; p = .013) during follow-up. Clozapine showed a trend toward having fewer total extrapyramidal side effects. At 12 weeks participants who were receiving clozapine reported that their mental health was significantlybetter compared with those receiving other SGA drugs. In conclusion, in people with schizophrenia with poor treatment response to 2 or more antipsychotic drugs,there is an advantage to commencing clozapine rather than other SGA drugs in terms of symptom improvement over 1 year.

[lh, patient, follow-up, fatigue, pain, baseline]

Learned helplessness predicts functional disability, pain and fatigue in patients with recent-onset inflammatory polyarthritis.
Objectives. Cross-sectional studies have found that learned helplessness (LH) is associated with disease outcome in patients with RA. However, little is known about the longitudinal impact of LH. The aim of this study was to investigate whether LH is associated with future disease outcome (disability, pain and fatigue) and to investigate whether LH changes over time in patients with recent-onset inflammatory polyarthritis (IP), the broader group of conditions of which RA is the major constituent.Methods. Patients included in this investigation had been recruited to the Norfolk Arthritis Register, a primary-care-based inception cohort. LH was measured at baseline as patients' total score on the Rheumatology Attitudes Index (RAI). A total of 443 patients completed the HAQ and visual analogue scales of pain and fatigue at baseline and after 2 years of follow-up.Results. Greater feelings of LH at baseline were associated with higher HAQ scores at follow-up difference in HAQ score per 1-point increase in RAI score (β-coefficient) 0.02; 95% CI 0.01, 0.04. Greater baseline LH was also associated with more pain (β-coefficient 1.0; 95% CI 0.4, 1.5) and more fatigue (β-coefficient 1.0; 95% CI 0.2, 1.4) at follow-up. LH was highly changeable during follow-up, with 87% of patients showing any change and 50% improving.Conclusion. Baseline LH independently predicted disability, pain and fatigue at follow-up. Half of patients reported fewer feelings of helplessness after 2 years of follow-up, suggesting that LH may potentially be a modifiable risk factor for disease outcome in IP and a target for intervention.

[cartilage, risk, loss, subregion, damage, baseline, feature]

Co-localisation of non-cartilaginous articular pathology increases risk of cartilage loss in the tibiofemoral joint--the MOST study.
PURPOSE: To assess risk of cartilage loss in the tibiofemoral joint in relation to baseline damage severity, and to analyse the association of nearby pathologic findings on the risk of subsequent cartilage loss. METHODS: The Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study is a longitudinal study of individuals with or at high risk for knee osteoarthritis. MRI examinations were assessed according to the Whole Organ MRI Score. Included were all knees with available baseline and 30 months MRIs. Ordinal logistic regression was used to estimate risk of cartilage loss in each subregion in relation to the number of associated articular features including bone marrow lesions, meniscal damage and extrusion and also in regard to baseline damage severity, respectively. RESULTS: 13 524 subregions of 1365 knees were included. 3777 (27.9%) subregions exhibited prevalent cartilage damage at baseline and 1119 (8.3%) subregions showed cartilage loss at 30-month follow-up. Risk of cartilage loss was increased for subregions with associated features (OR 2.53, 95% CI 2.03 to 3.15 for one, 4.32 95% CI 3.42 to 5.47 for two and 5.30 95% CI 3.95 to 7.12 for three associated features; p for trend <0.0001). Subregions with prevalent cartilage damage showed increased risk for further cartilage loss compared to subregions with intact cartilage at baseline with small superficial defects exhibiting highest risk. CONCLUSIONS: Risk of cartilage loss is increased for subregions with associated pathology and further increased when more than one type of associated feature is present. In addition, prevalent cartilage damage increases risk for subsequent cartilage loss.

Bladder smooth muscle dysfunction in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
Urodynamic studies were carried out on 30 patients with irritable bowel syndrome and 30 matched controls. Fifty per cent of the irritable bowel patients compared with only 13% of the control group had evidence of bladder dysfunction (p = 0.006). In the irritable bowel group detrusor instability was observed in 10 patients compared with only one control subject (p = 0.008). A steep cystometrogram occurred in five irritable bowel patients and three controls (NS). Detrusor instability was most common in patients with a bowel habit characterised by alternating constipation and diarrhoea. This is the first study to provide objective evidence that patients with irritable bowel syndrome may have a disorder of smooth muscle or its innervation that is not confined to the gastrointestinal system.

[ventral, domain, basal, ganglion, input, computational, dopamine, striatum]

The ventral basal ganglia, a selection mechanism at the crossroads of space, strategy, and reward
The basal ganglia are often conceptualised as three parallel domains that include all the constituent nuclei. The 'ventral domain' appears to be critical for learning flexible behaviours for exploration and foraging, as it is the recipient of converging inputs from amygdala, hippocampal formation and prefrontal cortex, putatively centres for stimulus evaluation, spatial navigation, and planning/contingency, respectively. However, compared to work on the dorsal domains, the rich potential for quantitative theories and models of the ventral domain remains largely untapped, and the purpose of this review is to provide the stimulus for this work. We systematically review the ventral domain's structures and internal organisation, and propose a functional architecture as the basis for computational models. Using a full schematic of the structure of inputs to the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens core and shell), we argue for the existence of many identifiable processing channels on the basis of unique combinations of afferent inputs. We then identify the potential information represented in these channels by reconciling a broad range of studies from the hippocampal, amygdala and prefrontal cortex literatures with known properties of the ventral striatum from lesion, pharmacological, and electrophysiological studies. Dopamine's key role in learning is reviewed within the three current major computational frameworks; we also show that the shell-based basal ganglia sub-circuits are well placed to generate the phasic burst and dip responses of dopaminergic neurons. We detail dopamine's modulation of ventral basal ganglia's inputs by its actions on pre-synaptic terminals and post-synaptic membranes in the striatum, arguing that the complexity of these effects hint at computational roles for dopamine beyond current ideas. The ventral basal ganglia are revealed as a constellation of multiple functional systems for the learning and selection of flexible behaviours and of behavioural strategies, sharing the common operations of selection-by-disinhibition and of dopaminergic modulation.

[surface, smooth, breast, textured, contact, angle]

Characterisation of breast implant surfaces and correlation with fibroblast adhesion.
INTRODUCTION: Capsular contracture formation is a common complication following breast augmentation surgery. Breast implant shells have either a smooth or a textured surface. Smooth surfaces demonstrate a higher incidence of contracture formation. The 3-dimensional surface of textured implants is thought to disrupt contractile forces and reduce capsular contracture rates. AIM: To investigate the interaction of fibroblasts with silicone breast implant surfaces through characterization of their unique features. METHOD: Surfaces of smooth and textured breast implants were characterized using a confocal laser scanning microscope, a microtest 5kN tensile testing device, and a contact angle goniometer. The kinetics of fibroblast interaction with these surfaces was further analysed. RESULTS: The textured surfaces were rough, and nodular containing high peaks and deep crevasses with roughness (Sa) values in the range 8.88-18.83μm and contact angles between 130° and 142°. The smooth implant surfaces were less rough, more regular and repetitive with 0.06-0.07μm surface roughness, and contact angles between 110.9° and 111.8°. The textured surfaces displayed higher bending stiffness than the smooth surfaces (0.19 and 0.26Nmm). Significant (p<0.05) numbers of fibroblasts were attached to the textured surfaces compared to the smooth surfaces which had higher levels of cell adhesion with surface roughness above 8μm and contact angles above 130°. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, surfaces with arithmetical mean deviation of greater roughness and reduced hydrophilicity with high water contact angles enhanced cell adhesion. These features aid design of improved surfaces, which may help, in prevention of breast capsular formation.

Enhanced photovoltaic performance in nanoimprinted pentacene-PbS nanocrystal hybrid device
<p>Pentacene and PbS nanocrystal bilayer photovoltaic devices are fabricated after the pentacene layer is subjected to nanoimprinting using a laser textured silicon stamp. Increased short circuit current densities are observed for the imprinted devices, which are attributed to increased charge mobility in the pentacene film caused by the decrease in the intermolecular distances during nanoimprinting. This work is consistent with previous reports where hydrostatic pressure induced mobility increases have been observed in polyacenes under gigapascal pressure regimes. It is believed that the pentacene film undergoes localized high pressures during nanoimprinting, giving rise to the increased hole mobilities. (c) 2008 American Institute of Physics.</p>

[protein, lifetime, fluorescence, cell, gfp-tagged, flim, imaging]

Imaging fluorescence lifetime heterogeneity applied to GFP-tagged MHC protein at an immunological synapse.
Fluorescence imaging of green fluorescent protein (GFP) may be used to locate proteins in live cells and fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) may be employed to probe the local microenvironment of proteins. Here we apply FLIM to GFP-tagged proteins at the cell surface and at an inhibitory natural killer (NK) cell immunological synapse (IS). We present a novel quantitative analysis of fluorescence lifetime images that we believe is useful to determine whether apparent FLIM heterogeneity is statistically significant. We observe that, although the variation of observed fluorescence lifetime of GFP-tagged proteins at the cell surface is close to the expected statistical range, the lifetime of GFP-tagged proteins in cells is shorter than recombinant GFP in solution. Furthermore the lifetime of GFP-tagged major histocompatibility complex class I protein is shortened at the inhibitory NK cell IS compared with the unconjugated membrane. Following our previous work demonstrating the ability of FLIM to report the local refractive index of GFP in solution, we speculate that these lifetime variations may indicate local refractive index changes. This application of our method for detecting small but significant differences in fluorescence lifetimes shows how FLIM could be broadly useful in imaging discrete membrane environments for a given protein.

Azole antifungal resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus: 2008 and 2009.
OBJECTIVES: Resistance to azole antifungal drugs in Aspergillus fumigatus is now a major clinical problem in some locations. Here we update our previous experience with data from 2008-09. METHODS: We tested all A. fumigatus isolates submitted to the Mycology Reference Centre Manchester in 2008 and 2009 for susceptibility to itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole. We undertook CYP51A sequencing for most of the azole-resistant isolates. RESULTS: Of 230 isolates, 64 (28%) were azole resistant. In 2008 and 2009, 14% and 20% of patients had resistant isolates, respectively. During this period 62 of 64 (97%) were itraconazole resistant, 2 of 64 (3%) were only voriconazole resistant and 78% of cases were multi-azole resistant. Forty-three percent of isolates did not carry a cyp51A mutation (previously the most common azole resistance mechanism), indicating that other mechanisms must be responsible and are increasing in frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Azole resistance is evolving and growing in frequency. Established and novel mechanisms may be responsible.

Patients' perceptions and experiences of venous leg ulceration and their attitudes to larval therapy: an in-depth qualitative study.
BACKGROUND: Venous leg ulcers are a common and distressing condition that can impair quality of life. Larval therapy has been widely promoted for the treatment of different types of chronic wounds, yet little is known about its acceptability to patients. OBJECTIVES: To explore patients' experiences of venous leg ulceration and of the acceptability of larval therapy as a treatment. DESIGN: Qualitative study, using semi-structured interviews alongside a randomized controlled trial. Interview data were transcribed and analysed for thematic content. Data were collected from April 2007 to July 2007. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen people (12 men, 6 women), aged between 29 and 93 years (median age 64 years), with at least one venous leg ulcer, took part in the study. Fourteen people were recruited from two vascular clinics (one attached to a hospital and the other located in a community setting). A further four people were recruited through referral from a team of community nurses. FINDINGS: Participants portrayed lives blighted by the presence of one or more leg ulcers. The majority were willing to try 'maggots' (larvae) and able to overcome feelings of squeamishness because of their strong desire to heal their ulcers. Five people treated with larvae were included in the study. Initial improvements in the condition of their ulcers were not sustained, and two participants experienced severe pain. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Patients may hold unrealistic expectations that larval therapy will effect a longed-for cure for their leg ulcer(s) but an absence of healing may lead to feelings of disappointment or despair.

Dignity, happiness and being able to live a 'normal life' in the UK: an examination of post-accession Polish migrants' transnational autobiographical fields
This article examines data from a qualitative study of post-accession Polish migrants living in the UK. We examine themes from our interviews such as ‘dignity’, ‘normality’, ‘happiness’ and the ‘affordability’ and ‘ease’ of life in the UK (compared to Poland). We focus on the autobiographical or intra-personal discursive practices that define what Habib calls migrants' continuing relationship with their ‘homeland’. We draw on Emirbayer and Mische's analysis of the relationship between ‘agency’ and what they call ‘embedded temporalities’ to examine the interaction between our participants' recollections of life in Poland and their evaluation of their present lives in the UK in order to examine the impact of these on their future plans (to stay in the UK or return to Poland). We locate this analysis in what we call a transnational autobiographical field which is a modification of what Levitt and Glick Schiller call a transnational social field. Rather than examine, for example, how decisions to migrate, settle and re-migrate are embedded in inter or trans-personal social relations and networks, in this article we examine the self-dynamics associated with our participants' articulation of their intra-personal and autobiographical embedded temporalities. Our argument is that articulations of individuals' pasts, presents and anticipated futures are also significant factors shaping their migration, settlement, and re-migration decisions.

Large Eddy Simulation of a 3-Bladed Horizontal Axis Tidal Stream Turbine: Comparisons to RANS and Experiments
This paper presents results from numerical simulations of a 3-bladed horizontal axis tidal stream turbine (TST). A two-equation transient Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) k-! Shear Stress Transport (SST)model was used for code validation and testing of a newly implemented sliding mesh technique for Code Saturne. Wall- and blade-resolved large-eddy simulations (LES) were then performed to study the complete geometry at various tip speed ratios (TSR). Thrust and power coefficients were compared to experimental measurements in a towing tank for a range of TSR (4, 5, 6, 7 & 8) at a fixed hub pitch angle. A strong flow meandering was observed with the wake recovery and velocity deficit showing a high sensitivity to upstream turbulence intensities. The mean thrust and power coefficients by RANS k-! SST model were found to be more sensitive to the upstream turbulence than the LES. A comparison of all models are also presented for the mean sectional blade pressures and mean wake velocity profiles. The paper also presents an overview of modelling and numerical issues relating to fine LES for such rotating geometries

A systematic review of risk prediction in adult cardiac surgery: considerations for future model development.
OBJECTIVES: Risk prediction in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery remains inaccurate and should be further improved. Therefore, we aimed to identify risk factors that are predictive of mortality, stroke, renal failure and/or length of stay after adult cardiac surgery in contemporary practice. METHODS: We searched the Medline database for English-language original contributions from January 2000 to December 2011 to identify preoperative independent risk factors of one of the following outcomes after adult cardiac surgery: death, stroke, renal failure and/or length of stay. Two investigators independently screened the studies. Inclusion criteria were (i) the study described an adult cardiac patient population; (ii) the study was an original contribution; (iii) multivariable analyses were performed to identify independent predictors; (iv) ≥ 1 of the predefined outcomes was analysed; (v) at least one variable was an independent predictor, or a variable was included in a risk model that was developed. RESULTS: The search yielded 5768 studies. After the initial title screening, a second screening of the full texts of 1234 studies was performed. Ultimately, 844 studies were included in the systematic review. In these studies, we identified a large number of independent predictors of mortality, stroke, renal failure and length of stay, which could be categorized into variables related to: disease pathology, planned surgical procedure, patient demographics, patient history, patient comorbidities, patient status, blood values, urine values, medication use and gene mutations. Many of these variables are frequently not considered as predictive of outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Risk estimates of mortality, stroke, renal failure and length of stay may be improved by the inclusion of additional (non-traditional) innovative risk factors. Current and future databases should consider collecting these variables.

[biomarker, response, imaging, therapeutics, mri]

False-negative MRI biomarkers of tumour response to targeted cancer therapeutics.
BACKGROUND: Non-invasive quantitative imaging biomarkers are essential for the evaluation of novel targeted therapeutics. Before deployment in clinical trials, such imaging biomarkers require qualification, typically through pre-clinical identification of imaging-pathology correlates. METHODS: First, in investigating imaging biomarkers of invasion, the response of orthotopic murine PC3 prostate xenografts to the Src inhibitor saracatinib was assessed using susceptibility contrast MRI. Second, the longitudinal response of chemically induced rat mammary adenocarcinomas to the VEGFR2 inhibitor vandetanib was monitored by intrinsic susceptibility MRI, to identify the time window of transient vascular normalisation. RESULTS: No significant differences in fractional blood volume (%), vessel calibre (μm), native T(1) (ms) or apparent water diffusion coefficient were determined, despite reduced expression of activated Fak and paxillin in the saracatinib cohort. Treatment with vandetanib elicited a 60% antitumour response (P<0.01), 80% inhibition in vessel density (P<0.05) and reduction in hypoxia (P<0.05). There was, however, no significant change in tumour baseline R(2)* (s(-1)) or carbogen-induced ΔR(2)* with treatment. CONCLUSION: Reporting negative imaging biomarker responses is important, to avoid the risk of clinical trials using the same biomarkers being undertaken with a false expectation of success, and the abandonment of promising new therapeutics based on a false-negative imaging biomarker response being mistaken for a true-negative.

[infection, mouse, rsv, lung, virus, vaccination]

Influenza virus lung infection protects from respiratory syncytial virus-induced immunopathology.
The effect of infection history is ignored in most animal models of infectious disease. The attachment protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) induces T helper cell type 2-driven pulmonary eosinophilia in mice similar to that seen in the failed infant vaccinations in the 1960s. We show that previous influenza virus infection of mice: (a) protects against weight loss, illness, and lung eosinophilia; (b) attenuates recruitment of inflammatory cells; and (c) reduces cytokine secretion caused by RSV attachment protein without affecting RSV clearance. This protective effect can be transferred via influenza-immune splenocytes to naive mice and is long lived. Previous immunity to lung infection clearly plays an important and underestimated role in subsequent vaccination and infection. The data have important implications for the timing of vaccinations in certain patient groups, and may contribute to variability in disease susceptibility observed in humans.

Is there Equity in HPV vaccination and Cervical Screening in the North West of England? : A Study of Mothers and Daughters
Introduction
Cervical screening uptake is steadily declining with evidence of inequalities by deprivation and ethnicity. The introduction of the HPV vaccination programme has the potential to reverse the downward trend in cervical cancer prevention by protecting girls who in future may not attend for cervical screening.ObjectiveTo investigate equity in cervical cancer prevention by examining uptake of adolescent HPV vaccination of daughters and cervical cancer screening attendance in their mothers. 
Methods 
HPV vaccination records of girls aged 12-13 years were linked by address to their mothers cervical screening records from 15 North West Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) (n = 24,409 mother-daughter pairs).  Vaccination and Screening records were matched to deprivation quintiles (as measured by the 2007 Index of Multiple Deprivation IMD scores) and ethnicity (classified by South Asian ethnicity using the Nam Pehchan computer programme). 

Results 
Results from preliminary analysis show daughters vaccination completion was associated with mothers screening attendance. Screening uptake was significantly lower in mothers whose daughters had received no vaccination doses compared to those that had received three doses (Odds Ratio OR = 1.35; 95% Confidence Interval CI 1.24 to 1.47) or partial immunisation status (OR=1.19; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.35).  Uptake of both vaccination and screening programmes were associated with deprivation quintile (Chi Square, p<0.0001) and ethnicity, with uptake significantly lower in South Asian groups (Cervical screening = Chi Square p<0.05, HPV vaccination p<0.0001).   

Conclusion 
Mother’s behaviour towards cervical screening appears to be indicative of HPV uptake in daughters. The HPV vaccination programme may therefore be subject to the same inequalities in coverage as the cervical screening programme.

Duckworth, V., Ingle, S., and Lord, J. (2012).  Shifting sands and teacher education: preparing future lifelong learning teachers for their first years in professional teaching practice, or preparing them to keep their heads above water?
This collaborative study explores the transitions of three former further education teachers, at different points in their academic careers, into Higher Education teaching.   We suggest that this transition inevitably brings a number of personal and professional challenges. With an increasing move towards performativity via target setting, results and accountability, a great deal of academics’ time and energy is governed by a managerial-driven system based on close scrutiny of paperwork, and increasing emotional labour (e.g. Bathmaker and Avis, 2006) in work environments where job security is unstable due to redundancies and restructuring. This often leaves academics fearful of their job security, exhausted and reluctant to challenge the hegemony based on quantifiable outcomes whereby notions of critical autonomy are side-lined for compliance. The data draws on life history methodology and narrative enquiry.   It explores our stories and the process of what Clough and Nutbrown (2002, p.81) describe as ‘focused conversations’. It moves from viewing society as a disembodied structure, and instead sets our narratives against the backdrop of cultural, historical and political landscape, providing a life history methodology that allows us to make sense of our transitions through our connections.  The intertwining of our narratives provides an insight into how university lecturers engage in shaping a professional identity, and leads us to suggest that communities of practice (Lave and Wenger, 1991, Wenger, 1998, Wenger et al., 2002) can support teachers’ critical autonomy in their early career.

[acid, amino, transfer, model, factor]

Review: Modelling placental amino acid transfer - From transporters to placental function.
Amino acid transfer to the fetus is dependent on several different factors. While these factors can be understood in isolation, it is still not possible to predict the function of the system as a whole. In order to do this an integrated approach is required which incorporates the interactions between the different determinants of amino acid transfer. Computational modelling of amino acid transfer in the term human placenta provides a mechanism by which this integrated approach can be delivered. Such a model would be invaluable for understanding amino acid transfer in both normal and pathological pregnancies. In order to develop a computational model it is necessary to determine all the biological factors which are important contributors to net amino acid transfer and the ways in which they interact. For instance, how different classes of amino acid transporter must interact to transfer amino acids across the placenta. Mathematically, the kinetics of each type of transporter can be represented by separate equations that describe their transfer rate as a non-linear function of amino acid concentrations. These equations can then be combined in the model to predict the overall system behaviour. Testing these predictions experimentally will demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the model, which can then be refined with increasing complexity and retested in an iterative fashion. In this way we hope to develop a functional computational model which will allow exploration of the factors that determine amino acid transfer across the placenta. This model may also allow the development of strategies to optimise placental transfer in pathologies associated with impaired amino acid transfer such as fetal growth restriction.

Influence of core suture geometry on tendon deformation and gap formation in porcine flexor tendons.
The effects of core suture geometry on the mechanics of failure in flexor tendon surgery are investigated. Forty porcine flexor tendons were repaired using a Kessler; a Kessler-Pennington; a double Kessler; a continuous Kessler; and a cruciate repair. At maximum breaking strength, the cruciate repair gapped more then the double Kessler (12.8 mm vs 9.1 mm), but the double Kessler was less strong (37N vs 45 N). Transverse narrowing was 22% and 24% for the Kessler and the Kessler-Pennington, 11% for the double Kessler, and 0% for the continuous Kessler and the cruciate repair. Kessler-type sutures failed by suture breakage and the cruciate repair by pull-out. Under load, the transverse part of the Kessler sutures narrows, allowing longitudinal parts to lengthen, leading to gapping. The double Kessler shortened transverse segment decreases gapping. Eliminating a transverse component (the cruciate repair) decreased gapping, but the cruciate failed at higher loads by suture pull-out.

An antisense oligonucleotide targeting the alphaV integrin gene inhibits adhesion and induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells.
The aim of this study was to show the anti-adhesive potential of an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) approach when designed to suppress the cellular function of the alphaV integrin subunit in breast cancer cells. The alphaV integrins play major roles in favouring breast cancer spreading. In this study, we inhibited alphaV subunit synthesis in the human breast carcinoma cell line, MDA-MB231, by a partially phosphorothioated antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (5543-ODN). The alphaV antisense 5543-ODN reduced alphaV, but not actin, mRNA transcription and protein expression by 55% and 65% respectively (1 microM, 72 h). Control sense and mismatch reagents were inactive. The antisense, but not the sense and mismatch, 5543-ODN induced dose- and time-dependent inhibition of MDA-MB231 adhesion to serum, vitronectin, fibrinogen and fibronectin substrates but was inactive on adhesion to laminin. Thus, the alphaV integrin was located in adhesion structures, which were disrupted by treatment with the alphaV antisense 5543-ODN. Antisense treated cells also showed evidence of programmed cell death with the appearance of apoptotic bodies. MDA-MB231 cells express a mutant form of the pro-apoptotic factor p53; however, no changes in the expression of p53 were observed by Western blotting. Immunofluorescence did reveal an increased nuclear translocation of p53 suggesting activation of the protein, but such a translocation did not lead to significant changes in either the expression of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, p21(WAF1/CIP1) the cell survival factor Bcl-2 or the pro-apoptotic factor Bax.

EVALUATION OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NURSING PROCESS AMONG NURSE CLINICIANS
This research was carried out in Kaduna State, Nigeria to determine whether Nursing Process is used in patients care or not. Utilizing an ex-post facto research design, a multistage sampling technique was used to select 210 nurses from urban and rural based hospitals from the three (3) senatorial districts of Kaduna State. Self-administered questionnaires were used for data collection. About 78% (163) of the questionnaire was filled and returned. The major findings were that 57.1% of the respondents indicated that Nursing Process is used in patients care in Kaduna state General Hospitals while 14.1% revealed that the use of nursing process started and stopped and 25.8% indicated that it is not used in patients care. The major factors that militated against the implementation of Nursing Process were identified as shortage of nursing staff (54.0%) and insufficient equipment (28.2%) for the implementation of Nursing Process in patients care. Three null hypotheses tested at significant level of 0.05 indicated that, years of experience and qualification does not relate significantly with the implementation of nursing process but rank of nurses relates significantly with the implementation of nursing process.&nbsp; The major opinions advanced by the respondents as a solution to these factors were that more nursing staff should be provided at every duty hours and the provision of basic care equipment for nursing care on patients. It is recommended that Nursing Process forms used in patients care should be adapted rather than adopted to suite the peculiarities of our environment in order to facilitate its full implementation in patients care.&nbsp; &nbsp; KEYWORDS- Evaluation, Nursing process, Nurse Clinicians&nbsp;&nbsp;

Gene expression profile of peripheral blood lymphocytes from renal cell carcinoma patients treated with IL-2, Interferon-α and dendritic cell vaccine
Lymphocytes are a key component of the immune system and their differentiation and function are directly influenced by cancer. We examined peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) gene expression as a biomarker of illness and treatment effect using the Affymetrix Human Gene ST1 platform in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) who received combined treatment with IL-2, interferon-?-2a and dendritic cell vaccine. We examined gene expression, cytokine levels in patient serum and lymphocyte subsets as determined by flow cytometry (FCM). Pre-treatment PBLs from patients with mRCC exhibit a gene expression profile and serum cytokine profile consistent with inflammation and proliferation not found in healthy donors (HD). PBL gene expression from patients with mRCC showed increased mRNA of genes involved with T-cell and TREG-cell activation pathways, which was also reflected in lymphocyte subset distribution. Overall, PBL gene expression post-treatment (POST) was not significantly different than pre-treatment (PRE). Nevertheless, treatment related changes in gene expression (post-treatment minus pre-treatment) revealed an increased expression of T-cell and B-cell receptor signaling pathways in responding (R) patients compared to non-responding (NR) patients. In addition, we observed down-regulation of TREG-cell pathways post-treatment in R vs. NR patients. While exploratory in nature, this study supports the hypothesis that enhanced inflammatory cytotoxic pathways coupled with blunting of the regulatory pathways is necessary for effective anti-cancer activity associated with immune therapy. This type of analysis can potentially identify additional immune therapeutic targets in patients with mRCC.© The Author(s),  2012.

A randomised, controlled trial of new atypical drugs versus clozapine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia Abstract. 12th Biennial Winter Workshop on Schizophrenia, Davos, Switzerland.
Background: A single-blind, multicentre RCT compared the class of new (non-clozapine) atypical drugs with clozapine in patients in the NHS whose medication was being changed because of poor clinical response to two or more antipsychoticdrugs.Methods: The primary outcome was the Quality of Life Scale. Secondary clinical outcomes included symptoms (PANSS), side effects and participant satisfaction. Economic outcomes were costs of health and social care and a utility measure. A total of 136 (98% of the planned sample) participants were randomised. Followup at 52 weeks, blind to treatment allocation, was complete in 87%.Results: The intent to treat comparison of new atypicals compared with clozapine in people with more narrowly defined treatment resistance showed an advantage for commencing clozapine in quality of life (QLS) at trend level ( p = 0.08) and insymptoms (PANSS), that was statistically significant ( p = 0.01), at 1 year. Clozapine showed approximately a 4-point advantage (not statistically significant) on QLS score at 52 weeks, against the predicted 10 points, and approximately a 5-point advantage on PANSS total score. Clozapine showed a trend towards having less total extrapyramidal side effects ( p = 0.1). Participants reported at 12 weeks that their mental health was significantly better with clozapine than with new atypicals ( p < 0.05). Net costs of care varied widely, with a mean of £33,588 in the clozapine group and £28,122 in the new atypical group, not a statistically significant difference. Of these costs, 4.0% and 3.3%, respectively, were dueto antipsychotic drug costs.

Erlotinib in combination with pemetrexed for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC): a phase I dose-finding study.
BACKGROUND: Erlotinib and pemetrexed are approved single agents for second-line treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and, in combination, have shown synergistic antitumor activity in NSCLC cell lines. We investigated the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of combined erlotinib-pemetrexed in patients with refractory advanced NSCLC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A nonrandomized, open-label, phase IB study was performed in patients with advanced NSCLC whose disease had progressed on or following first-line chemotherapy with a platinum-containing regimen or for whom the erlotinib-pemetrexed combination was considered appropriate. Patients received i.v. pemetrexed 500-700 mg/m² every 3 weeks and oral erlotinib 100-150 mg/day. RESULTS: Twenty patients were recruited. The most common adverse events (AEs) were rash, diarrhea and fatigue. Serious AEs occurred in eight patients (three treatment related) and there were eight deaths (none treatment related). Dose-limiting toxic effects were not experienced up to erlotinib 150 mg/day plus pemetrexed 600 mg/m². Concurrent administration did not affect pharmacokinetic parameters. Two patients achieved partial responses and nine had stable disease. CONCLUSIONS: Erlotinib-pemetrexed combination is well tolerated at doses equal to the licensed single-agent doses (150 mg/day and 500 mg/m², respectively). The good tolerability profile and promising efficacy indicate that this combination warrants further investigation for patients with advanced NSCLC.

A Method for Comparing Multivariate Time Series with Different Dimensions
In many situations it is desirable to compare dynamical systems based on their behavior. Similarity of behavior often implies similarity of internal mechanisms or dependency on common extrinsic factors. While there are widely used methods for comparing univariate time series, most dynamical systems are characterized by multivariate time series. Yet, comparison of multivariate time series has been limited to cases where they share a common dimensionality. A semi-metric is a distance function that has the properties of non-negativity, symmetry and reflexivity, but not sub-additivity. Here we develop a semi-metric – SMETS – that can be used for comparing groups of time series that may have different dimensions. To demonstrate its utility, the method is applied to dynamic models of biochemical networks and to portfolios of shares. The former is an example of a case where the dependencies between system variables are known, while in the latter the system is treated (and behaves) as a black box.

Comparison of three screening tools to detect psoriatic arthritis in patients with psoriasis (CONTEST study).
Background  Multiple questionnaires to screen for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) have been developed but the optimal screening questionnaire is unknown. Objectives  To compare three PsA screening questionnaires in a head-to-head study using CASPAR (the Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis) as the gold standard. Methods  This study recruited from 10 U.K. secondary care dermatology clinics. Patients with a diagnosis of psoriasis, not previously diagnosed with PsA, were given all three questionnaires. All patients who were positive on any questionnaire were invited for a rheumatological assessment. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare the sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve of the three questionnaires according to CASPAR criteria. Results  In total, 938 patients with psoriasis were invited to participate and 657 (70%) patients returned the questionnaires. One or more questionnaires were positive in 314 patients (48%) and 195 (62%) of these patients attended for assessment. Of these, 47 patients (24%) were diagnosed with PsA according to the CASPAR criteria. The proportion of patients with PsA increased with the number of positive questionnaires (one questionnaire, 19·1%; two, 34·0%; three, 46·8%). Sensitivities and specificities for the three questionnaires, and areas under the ROC curve were, respectively: Psoriatic Arthritis Screening Evaluation (PASE), 74·5%, 38·5%, 0·594; Psoriasis Epidemiology Screening Tool (PEST), 76·6%, 37·2%, 0·610; Toronto Psoriatic Arthritis Screen (ToPAS), 76·6%, 29·7%, 0·554. The majority of patients with a false positive response had degenerative or osteoarthritis. Conclusion  Although the PEST and ToPAS questionnaires performed slightly better than the PASE questionnaire at identifying PsA, there is little difference between these instruments. These screening tools identify many cases of musculoskeletal disease other than PsA.

The retinoblastoma protein interacts with Bag-1 in human colonic adenoma and carcinoma derived cell lines.
Although the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene RB1 is inactivated in a wide range of human tumours, overexpression in colonic carcinomas has been linked to the antiapoptotic function of the protein. In the current study we show that the Retinoblastoma susceptibility protein (Rb) protein interacts with Bag-1, an apoptotic regulator, in human colonic adenoma- and carcinoma-derived cell lines. Coimmunoprecipitation demonstrated that endogenous Rb and Bag-1 interact in both adenoma- and carcinoma-derived cell lines. The specificity of the interaction was demonstrated by expression of human Papillomavirus E7 oncoprotein, an inhibitor of Rb protein interactions, which disrupted the Rb/Bag-1 complex. We report that Bag-1 is predominantly localised in the nucleus of colorectal adenoma- and carcinoma-derived epithelial cells. Disruption of the Rb/Bag-1 complex through expression of E7 changes the subcellular distribution of Bag-1, decreasing nuclear localised Bag-1. Our work establishes that the Rb protein interacts with the Bag-1 apoptotic regulator protein, and introduces a novel function for Rb, involving modulation of the subcellular localisation of Bag-1 in human colonic epithelial cells.

Single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of zibotentan (ZD4054) in Chinese men with advanced solid tumors.
PURPOSE: The endothelin axis and the endothelin A (ET(A)) receptor have been implicated in tumor development and bone metastasis. This study aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety profiles of the specific ET(A) receptor antagonist, zibotentan, in elderly, male Chinese patients with advanced solid tumors. The PK data generated in these Chinese patients were further compared with those previously reported in Japanese and Caucasian patient populations. METHODS: In this Phase I, open-label study, patients received a single dose of zibotentan 10 mg on Day 1, followed by a 72-h washout period and 12 consecutive days of once-daily zibotentan 10 mg. RESULTS: Fifteen patients received at least one dose of zibotentan 10 mg. Exposure was demonstrated in all patients and the PK profiles following single dosing and multiple dosing showed relatively rapid absorption, decline in a monophasic manner, a modest amount of accumulation, and relatively low apparent clearance and volume of distribution. Zibotentan was well tolerated with no new safety concerns. Adverse events reported in >1 patient were pyrexia (n = 4), constipation (n = 3), headache (n = 3) and peripheral edema (n = 2). Comparative analysis found no evidence of significant differences in zibotentan exposure between the Chinese patients in our study, and the previous Japanese and Caucasian studies. CONCLUSIONS: The PK and safety profiles of zibotentan determined in this Chinese patient population are similar to those previously reported. Our findings suggest no clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences in zibotentan disposition between the patient populations analyzed.

Outcomes of choroid plexus tumours diagnosed in the North West region of the UK during 1954-2008
Background: Choroid plexus tumours (CPTs); namely choroid plexus papilloma (CPP) and choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC) are rare neoplasms of the central nervous system (CNS), accounting for 0.4-0.6% of all brain tumours and 1-4% of childhood brain tumours.  This study was undertaken to provide further insight into the epidemiology, natural history and outcomes in relation to changes in treatment emphasis for these rare tumours, over the last 56 years in the NW of England and determine the relative importance of possible contributory factors.Methods: Data relating to presentation, management and survival for 57 patients diagnosed with CPT between 1954-2008 was extracted from the North West Children’s Tumour Registry and hospital records.Results: Data collated showed a male predilection for choroid plexus carcinomas (22 male, 6 female) and an equal distribution of CPP and CPC (29 and 28 respectively). 5 year Kaplan-Meier estimates demonstrate significant improvements in survival for papillomas over the last 56 years with extent of resection being the most important factor in survival (p=0.001). Carcinomas show no significant improvement in survival over the last 56 years with 5 year survival fluctuating by 10% over the last 40 years.  However, overall survival is improved by adjuvant treatment with both chemotherapy and radiotherapy (p<0.05) with a non-significant trend for extent of resection leading to an improval in survival (p=0.08).  Radiotherapy remained the only significant factor in multivariable analysis (Cox p=0.031).Conclusion: Our study shows that CPC is more commonly diagnosed in males and that CPP and CPC arise in equal proportions.  OS for CPC has improved with the use of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. To the authors’ knowledge, this report characterises and provides survival data for choroid plexus tumours over a longer period of time than any other large single-institution series currently available.

Uniaxial strain in graphene by Raman spectroscopy: G peak splitting, Grüneisen parameters, and sample orientation
We uncover the constitutive relation of graphene and probe the physics of its optical phonons by studying its Raman spectrum as a function of uniaxial strain. We find that the doubly degenerate E(2g) optical mode splits in two components: one polarized along the strain and the other perpendicular. This splits the G peak into two bands, which we call G(+) and G(-), by analogy with the effect of curvature on the nanotube G peak. Both peaks redshift with increasing strain and their splitting increases, in excellent agreement with first-principles calculations. Their relative intensities are found to depend on light polarization, which provides a useful tool to probe the graphene crystallographic orientation with respect to the strain. The 2D and 2D(') bands also redshift but do not split for small strains. We study the Gruneisen parameters for the phonons responsible for the G, D, and D(') peaks. These can be used to measure the amount of uniaxial or biaxial strain, providing a fundamental tool for nanoelectronics, where strain monitoring is of paramount importance.

Treatment of limited small cell lung cancer: an old or new challenge?
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review highlights how progress has been made in treating limited small cell lung cancer and outlines current challenges to overcome for improved cure rates. RECENT FINDINGS: There is a rationale for the tumour, node, metastasis staging system to replace the current convention of limited versus extensive stage. Positron emission tomography may aid in staging but prospective validation in larger series of patients is needed. Cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy has yet to be superseded by either newer cytotoxic drugs or targeted agents. More progress has been made for radiotherapy but questions of optimal dose, schedule, timing and treatment volume remain unanswered. SUMMARY: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is associated with a one in four chance of cure. Two ongoing phase III trials have been designed to address the optimal radiotherapy regimen to combine with cisplatin and etoposide. Close collaboration between radiation and medical oncologists is needed to make further progress and to improve patient access to curative intent concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimens.

Chlamydia trachomatis infection: is it relevant in irritable bowel syndrome?
BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome can present with gynaecological symptoms similar to those of chronic pelvic inflammatory disease, which is commonly caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Infection with this organism might therefore lead to diagnostic and management difficulties in patients, not only as a result of symptom overlap between the two disorders but also because chlamydial infection might exacerbate the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. This study was designed to investigate any possible link between chlamydial infection and irritable bowel syndrome. PATIENTS/METHODS: The prevalence of antibodies to C. trachomatis and abdominal symptomatology was assessed in a group of 100 female patients with irritable bowel syndrome and 100 matched female controls. RESULTS: 25% of patients and 17% of controls were found to have evidence of previous chlamydial infection. This difference was not statistically significant. Within the patient group, no association was found between chlamydial infection and any particular pattern of symptomatology. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that occult chlamydial infection is not a major problem in irritable bowel syndrome and that routine investigation for this organism is unnecessary. They also provide some reassurance that pelvic inflammatory disease and all its potentially serious consequences is not being significantly overlooked in gastroenterological practice.

The lowest-lying transitions in these structures have been assigned via the p2n channel of the reactions of C-12 (38 MeV) and O-16 (48 MeV) beams with a Se-82 target, studied at the Bucharest Tandem accelerator. More detailed level schemes have been determined subsequently in a study performed with the GASP array of the inverse reactions produced by a Se-82 (470 MeV) beam from the Legnaro Tandem-LINAC accelerator with oxygen and possibly carbon contaminants of a (OS)-O-192 target.

[eosinophilia, mouse, lung, cell, cd8]

Host genetic determinants of vaccine-induced eosinophilia during respiratory syncytial virus infection.
In BALB/c mice, sensitization with the attachment protein (G) of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) leads to CD4+ T cell-mediated lung eosinophilia during subsequent challenge with RSV. To determine the host genetic influences on this model of lung eosinophilia, we tested 15 different inbred mouse strains. Eosinophilia developed in all H-2d (BALB/c, DBA/2n, and B10.D2), but not in H-2k (CBA/Ca, CBA/J, C3H, BALB.K, or B10.BR) mouse strains. Among H-2b mice, 129 and BALB.B developed eosinophilia, whereas C57BL/6 and C57BL/10 did not. Testing first generation crosses between sensitive and resistant strains showed that eosinophilia developed in all H-2dxk (n = 5), irrespective of background genes, but not in H-2dxb (n = 2) mice. In vivo depletion of CD8+ T cells or IFN-gamma rendered C57BL/6, but not BALB.K mice, susceptible to eosinophilia. Analysis of B10 recombinant mice showed that the Dd allele (in B10.A(5R) mice) prevented CD8+ T cell accumulation in the lung, resulting in intense lung eosinophilia. However, the Db allele (in B10.A(2R) and B10.A(4R) mice) supported CD8+ T cell expansion and prevented eosinophilia. Intracellular cytokine staining showed that lung eosinophilia correlated with reduced IFN-gamma and increased IL-10 expression in lung T cells. These results are compatible with the unifying model that Th2 cells mediate the disease but can be inhibited by CD8+ T cells secreting IFN-gamma. Our findings have important implications for the development of protective, nonpathogenic vaccines for RSV disease.

Modelling of Pyroelectric Detectors Detection by Digital Signal Processing Algorithms
Pyroelectric Detector (PED) models are developed considering the classical heatbalance equation to simulate the detector’s response under specified radiationconditions. Studies on the behaviour of a PED are presented under the conditions of stepfunction and a pulsed load. Finite Element Methods (FEMs) have been used to obtained3D models of the resulting temperature field in a Lithium Tantalate (LiTaO3)pyroelectric crystal, incorporated in a complete commercial detector, taking intoaccount details of its geometry and thermal connectivity. The novelty is the achievedfacility to predict the response to pulsed radiation, which is valuable for the engineeringof pulsed-source sensor systems requiring detection at room temperature.In this thesis, we present a signal processing (SP) algorithm, which combines theprinciple of Quadrature Synchronous Demodulation (QSD) and Gated Integration (GI),to achieve achieve an improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in pulsed signalmeasurements. As a first step, the pulse is bracketed by a gating window and thesamples outside the window are discarded. The gate duration is calculated to ensure thatthe periodic signal at the output has an “apparent” duty factor close to 0.5. This signalis then fed continuously for QSD to extract the magnitude and phase of its fundamentalcomponent, referenced to a sinusoidal signal with period defined by the gate length. Animproved SNR performance results not only from the increase of the average signalenergy, but also from the noise suppression inherent to the QSD principle. We introducethis method as Gated Quadrature Synchronous Demodulation (GQSD), emphasizing thesynergy between GΙ and QSD.

<p>The results of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of ethanol liquid and vapor using a modified version of the Cornell field W. D. Cornell and P. Cieplak, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 117, 5179 (1995) are presented. Excellent agreement with experiment is obtained for density, compressibility, and cohesive energy density. The ethanol liquid is subjected to uniform hydrostatic pressure in the range -1 to 15 kbar at room temperature and the vibrational frequency spectra are calculated. The peak frequencies of seven major vibrational modes are found to be accurate to within 100 cm(-1) of their experimental positions and the change of frequency as a function of pressure is consistent with Raman data. The change in bond length is found to be consistent with the solvation pressure model for all bonds except for O-H due to hydrogen bonding.</p>

Bioconversion of biodiesel by-products to value-added chemicals
To mitigate the problems of depleting and soaring price of fossil fuels, the production and use of renewable energy have been vigorously promoted. In Europe, the role of biologically-derived fuels and in particular biodiesel is gradually increasing in prominent. Rapeseed biodiesel is the most widely produced in Europe. As a consequence, enormous amount of by-products from production processes are being generated. Current strategies for managing these by-products (mainly rapeseed meal and crude glycerol) seem not to be economically sustainable. More efficient utilisation could add more value to the production chain which in turn would raise the competitiveness of biodiesel compared to petro-diesel. The aim of the project reported in this thesis was to study the feasibility of producing a value added product, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), from by-products generated from rapeseed biodiesel production processes as well as to investigate the effects of methanol, a major impurity in crude glycerol, on growth of Cupriavidus necator, a PHB-producing micro-organism.The preliminary study of C. necator growth in crude glycerol based media revealed that optimum concentration of crude glycerol was in a range 15-25 g/L. It was also found that slight changes in the carbon to nitrogen ratio of the feedstock did not significantly affect the growth while methanol at concentrations beyond 10 g/L did. A model based on a saturation equation was developed and used to successfully predict the inhibition of growth by methanol. From the developed model, mechanisms of the inhibition were proposed. The model could also be used to predict satisfactorily growth or productivity rates in other systems containing short-chain alcohols. The growth in solutions derived from rapeseed meal (designated as hydrolysate) via solid-state fermentation by Aspergillus oryzae followed by hydrolysis of the fermented solids was also studied. The biomass production was found to increase as a function of initial free amino nitrogen (FAN) concentration presented in the hydrolysate. However, at higher initial FAN concentrations, a lower conversion of nitrogen to biomass was observed. PHB production was studied using a feedstock which was a mixture of the hydrolysate and crude glycerol. Total biomass concentration reached 28.8 g/L at 120 h with 86% PHB content. PHB productivity and PHB yield on glycerol were 0.21 g/L•h and 0.32 g/g respectively. These results were comparable with those obtained when pure glycerol and synthetic crude glycerol were used, suggesting that, technically, the use of the generic rapeseed- and crude glycerol-based feedstock to produce PHB is feasible.Overall, the feasibility of producing PHB from rapeseed biodiesel by-products has been demonstrated. The satisfactory result leads to the more important outlook that the generic feedstock derived from rapeseed biodiesel by-products has the potential to be used to produce a wide range of products depending on the micro-organism used. Further development of this process to improve nutrient production efficiency as well as product yields and subsequent integration of the process into the biodiesel production process could well be an important contribution in the development of a sustainable biodiesel industry.

The future of industrial antibiotic production: from random mutagenesis to synthetic biology.
Natural products derived from the secondary metabolism of microbes constitute a cornerstone of modern medicine. Engineering bugs to produce these products in high quantities is a major challenge for biotechnology, which has usually been tackled by either one of two strategies: iterative random mutagenesis or rational design. Recently, we analyzed the transcriptome of a Streptomyces clavuligerus strain optimized for production of the ??-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid by multiple rounds of mutagenesis and selection, and discovered that the observed changes matched surprisingly well with simple changes that have been introduced into these strains by rational engineering. Here, we discuss how in the new field of synthetic biology, random mutagenesis and rational engineering can be implemented complementarily in ways which may enable one to go beyond the status quo that has now been reached by each method independently.

[galanin, hf, hair, human, growth]

The neuropeptide galanin is a novel inhibitor of human hair growth.
BACKGROUND: Galanin is a trophic factor of the central and peripheral nervous system that shows widespread distribution in human skin. However, the exact localization and the role of galanin in the hair follicle (HF) remain to be clarified. OBJECTIVES: To characterize galanin expression in human scalp HFs and to examine the effects of galanin on normal human scalp HF growth in organ culture. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was performed on cryosections of human female scalp skin. Anagen HFs were microdissected and cultured up to 9 days and treated with 100 nmol L(-1) galanin. Staining for Ki-67, TUNEL and Masson-Fontana were used to analyse proliferation, apoptosis and hair cycle staging of the HFs. Functional effects of galanin were tested in serum-free HF organ culture. RESULTS: Galanin-like immunoreactivity was detected in the outer root sheath (ORS) and inner root sheath. Additionally, galanin mRNA was detected in ORS keratinocytes and all HF samples tested. Galanin receptor transcripts (GalR2, GalR3) were also detected in selected samples. Galanin reduced proliferation of hair matrix keratinocytes in situ compared with vehicle-treated controls, shortened the hair growth phase (anagen) in vitro and reduced hair shaft elongation. This was accompanied by the premature development of a catagen-like morphology of galanin-treated HFs. CONCLUSIONS: We present the first evidence that human HFs are both a source and a functionally relevant target of galanin. Due to its hair growth-inhibitory properties in vitro, galanin application deserves further exploration as a potential new treatment strategy for unwanted hair growth (hirsutism, hypertrichosis).

The ETS Transcription Factors ELK1 and GABPA Regulate Different Gene Networks to Control MCF10A Breast Epithelial Cell Migration.
Members of the ETS transcription factor family often target the same binding regions and hence have the potential to regulate the same genes and downstream biological processes. However, individual family members also preferentially bind to other genomic regions, thus providing the potential for controlling distinct transcriptional programmes and generating specific biological effects. The ETS transcription factor ELK1 controls cell migration in breast epithelial cells through targeting a cohort of genes, independently from another family member GABPA, and therefore achieves biological specificity. Here, we demonstrate that GABPA also controls cell migration in breast epithelial cells. However, GABPA controls the expression of a different network of target genes to ELK1. Both direct and indirect target genes for GABPA are identified and amongst the direct targets we confirm the importance of RAC1 and KIF20A for cell migration. Therefore, although ELK1 and GABPA ultimately control the same biological process, they do so by regulating different cohorts of target genes associated with cytoskeletal functions and cell migration control.

A theme around descriptions of cough suggeststypically a dry tickly cough and highlights mechanicaland environmental triggers for cough. The theme aroundthe effects of cough in daily life shows the impact of coughin socialising, the embarrassment from cough and thepsychological effects experienced by patients. The lasttheme focuses on strategies for coping with and managingcough, showing the perceived ineffectiveness of currentantitussives and the patients' use of a variety of approacheson an ad hoc basis to try to manage their cough oftenunsuccessfully.Conclusion Cough has not received the same attention asother cancer symptoms, which means that patients' experienceof a distressing and difficult symptom is oftenunnoticed by health care professionals.

Interspecies comparison of gene structure and computational analysis of gene regulation of 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1
{17beta-Hydroxysteroid} dehydrogenase type 1 {(HSD17B1)} is a key enzyme of 17beta-estradiol biosynthesis, and in rodents is additionally involved in testosterone biosynthesis. The human {HSD17B1} gene, located on chromosome 17q12-21, is duplicated in tandem, with the 3???-copy being the functional gene. Here we show by sequencing the gene from a diverse set of related species that this duplication is of very recent evolutionary origin, having occurred in the common ancestor of Hominoidae (apes and humans) while being absent in the closely related Old World monkeys {(Macaca)} and the outgroup species Tupaia belangeri and Mus musculus. By computational analysis of the conserved regulatory elements in the 5???-untranslated {(5???-UTR)} and putative promoter region of the {HSD17B1} gene and, where present, pseudogene, across our broad sample of species we can show significant differences that might point to the origin of the divergent substrate specificity of human and rodent {HSD17B1} and highlight potential functionally relevant differences in regulatory patterns in different evolutionary lineages. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Late carmustine lung fibrosis. Age at treatment may influence severity and survival.
Previously, we have reported in 1990 that 35% of carmustine treated patients (6 of 17) who survived childhood brain tumors died of pulmonary fibrosis between 2 and 13 years after treatment. In addition, 8 patients studied in 1989 (13 to 17 years post treatment), had physiologic and biopsy or radiologic evidence of pulmonary fibrosis. We now report 3 more years of follow-up on these patients. Between 1989 and 1992, two more patients have died of pulmonary fibrosis, giving an overall mortality of 47%. Of the eight patients who died of pulmonary fibrosis, the median age at treatment was 2.5 years, whereas the nine long-term survivors had a median age at treatment of 10 years. All five patients treated below the age of 5 years have died of lung fibrosis. Analysis by the standard survival curve method indicated that patients treated at an age less than 6 years were more likely to die than those treated at an age older than 7 years (p = 0.03). Of the nine survivors, seven were observed over 3 more years. There was a gradual decline in mean forced vital capacity from 55% predicted (range, 44 to 81) to 51% predicted (range, 41 to 72) and total lung capacity fell from 65% predicted (range, 51 to 89) to 57% predicted (range, 47 to 77).

Circulating insulin-like growth factor II and colorectal adenomas
Circulating insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) may be risk factors for the development of colorectal cancer. On the other hand, IGF-II and IGFBP-2 are overexpressed in colorectal carcinomas. These contrasting backgrounds led us to investigate the relationship between serum IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3 and the presence of colorectal adenomas, known precursors of colorectal carcinoma, in 345 volunteers attending a screening flexible sigmoidoscopy trial (entry criteria: healthy, aged 55-64 yr). The most striking finding was an elevated mean serum IGF-II in individuals with adenomas (n = 52) compared with controls (mean difference, 139 ng/mL; 95% confidence intervals, 82, 196; P &lt; 0.0001). Logistic regression adjusting for confounding factors confirmed the significant association between IGF-II and adenoma occurrence (P &lt; 0.0001) and revealed an additional positive association with serum IGFBP-2 (P &lt; 0.0001). However, there was no association found between either serum IGF-I and/or IGFBP-3 and the presence of adenomas. Additionally, in 31 individuals with adenomas in whom levels were determined pre- and postpolypectomy, there was a significant fall in mean IGF-II (P &lt; 0.001) and IGFBP-2 (P &lt; 0.001) after adenoma removal, but no difference in IGF-II and IGFBP-2 concentrations between repeated samples in 20 individuals without adenomas. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated IGF-II expression in 83% of all adenomas, which contrasted with absent expression in normal colonic expression and hyperplastic polyps. This study has shown for the first time that serum IGF-II may be a tumor marker in individuals with colorectal adenomas. Further studies are needed to validate these relationships in larger populations, including individuals undergoing colonoscopy.

VenUS III: a randomised controlled trial of therapeutic ultrasound in the management of venous leg ulcers.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of low-dose ultrasound delivered in conjunction with standard care against standard care alone in the treatment of hard-to-heal venous ulcers. DESIGN: A multicentre, pragmatic, two-armed randomised controlled trial with an economic evaluation. SETTING: Community nurse services; community leg ulcer clinics; hospital outpatient leg ulcer clinics, among both urban and rural settings in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Ireland. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with a venous leg ulcer of > 6 months' duration or > 5 cm2 and an ankle-brachial pressure index of ≥ 0.8. In total, 337 patients were recruited to the study. INTERVENTIONS: Participants in the intervention group received low-dose ultrasound (0.5 W/cm2) delivered at 1 MHz, pulsed pattern of 1 : 4, applied to periulcer skin (via a water-based contact gel) weekly for up to 12 weeks alongside standard care. Standard care consisted of low-adherent dressings and compression therapy, renewed as recommended by the patient's nurse and modified if required to reflect changes in ulcer and skin condition. The output of the ultrasound machines was checked every 3 months to confirm intervention fidelity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point was time to healing of the largest eligible ulcer (reference ulcer). Secondary outcomes were time to healing of all ulcers, proportion of patients healed, percentage and absolute change in ulcer size, proportion of time patients were ulcer free, cost of treatments, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), adverse events, withdrawal and loss to follow-up. RESULTS: There was a small, and statistically not significant, difference in the median time to complete ulcer healing of all ulcers in favour of standard care median 328 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) 235 days, inestimable compared with ultrasound (median 365 days, 95% CI 224 days, inestimable). There was no difference between groups in the proportion of patients with ulcers healed at 12 months (72/168 in ultrasound vs 78/169 standard care), nor in the change in ulcer size at 4 weeks. There was no evidence of a difference in recurrence of healed ulcers. There was no difference in HRQoL measured using the Short Form questionnaire-12 items (SF-12) between the two groups. There were more adverse events with ultrasound than with standard care. Ultrasound therapy as an adjuvant to standard care was found not to be a cost-effective treatment when compared with standard care. The mean cost of ultrasound was £197.88 (bias-corrected 95% CI -£35.19 to £420.32) higher than standard care per participant per year. There was a significant relationship between ulcer healing and area and duration at baseline. In addition, those centres with high recruitment rates had the highest healing rates. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose ultrasound, delivered weekly during dressing changes, added to the package of current best practice (dressings, compression therapy) did not increase ulcer healing rates, affect quality of life (QoL) or reduce recurrence. It was associated with higher costs and more adverse events. There is no evidence that adding low-dose ultrasound to standard care for 'hard-to-heal' ulcers aids healing, improves QoL or reduces recurrence. It increases costs and adverse events. The relationship between ulcer healing rates and patient recruitment is worthy of further study. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN21175670.

Epidemiology of chronic oro-facial pain
Introduction:The aetiology of unexplained chronic oro-facial pain is still unclear and treatment of patients with this condition tends to be influenced by the background of the clinician assessing them. The complex neural anatomy of the oro-facial region makes diagnosis and classification of chronic oro-facial pain conditions very difficult with substantial delays in arriving at the correct diagnosis. Patients are subjected to multiple tests and treatments which often do not improve symptoms and result in overuse of already stretched health care resources. In addition, although chronic oro-facial pain is a well-recognised entity in a clinical setting, its prevalence and impact in the general population is poorly understood. Previous epidemiological studies have investigated oro-facial pain in its entirety and therefore included a wide spectrum of cases ranging from trivial short-lasting pains like tooth sensitivity to the more severe intractable cases of chronic oro-facial pain. Factors associated with specific chronic oro-facial pain symptoms such as temporomandibular pain dysfunction are predominantly psychosocial. This coupled with higher prevalence in females and altered health seeking behaviour suggest that chronic oro-facial pain may share common characteristics with other frequently unexplained chronic symptoms such as irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue and chronic widespread pain. Evidence from studies in clinic settings suggests that these chronic symptoms may co-occur. However, these studies have been limited by methodological shortcomings like selection and misclassification bias.Aims:The principal aims of the present study were to determine: (a) whether chronic oro-facial pain co-occurs with other frequently unexplained symptoms (b) whether factors associated with chronic oro-facial pain are common across symptoms.MethodsA population-based cross-sectional study was conducted using 4200 randomly selected adults who were recruited from the age-sex register of a General Medical Practice in North West, England. The study examined the prevalence and co-occurrence of chronic oro-facial pain with three other chronic symptoms that are frequently unexplained: chronic widespread pain, Irritable bowel syndrome and chronic fatigue. Validated instruments were used to measure the occurrence of symptoms and to collect information on a variety of associated factors: demographic (age, gender), psychosocial (anxiety, depression, illness behaviour, life stressors and reporting of somatic symptoms) and mechanical (teeth grinding, facial trauma, missing teeth and reporting that the teeth did not fit together properly). Subjects reporting oro-facial pain and who consented to further contact were clinically examined by an interviewer who was blinded to the subjects’ questionnaire responses. Oro-facial pain was then classified, using clinical examination, into four broad categories: musculoligamentous and soft tissue, neuralgic/vascular, dentoalveolar and unexplained.Results2505 subjects returned completed questionnaires (adjusted response rate 72%). The prevalence of Chronic Widespread Pain was 15%, Chronic Oro-facial Pain 7%, Irritable Bowel Syndrome 9% and Chronic Fatigue 8%. The study found that 587 subjects (27%) reported one or more symptoms: 404 (18%) reported one symptom, 134 (6%) reported two, 34 (2%) reported three, whilst 15 (1%) reported all four symptoms. The occurrence of multiple symptoms was much greater than would be expected by chance (p<0.001). There were factors that were common across all four symptoms: female gender (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.8, 95% CI 1.5-2.2), aspects of health anxiety like health worry preoccupation (OR 3.5; 95% CI 2.8-4.4) and reassurance seeking behaviour (OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1-1.7), reporting of other somatic symptoms (OR 3.6; 95% CI 2.9-4.4) and recent adverse life events (OR 2.5; 95% CI 2.0-3.0), self-reported teeth grinding (OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.5-2.2), facial trauma (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.7-2.6), missing teeth (OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.2-1.7) and the feeling that the teeth did not fit together properly (OR 1.6 95% CI 1.3-1.9). Clinical examination of subjects with oro-facial pain revealed that subjects reporting chronic oro-facial pain had increased odds (OR 3.0 95% C.I. 1.4-6.8) of being classified into the unexplained category compared with dentoalveolar or musculoligamentous categories. In addition to reporting chronic pain, subjects who were classified in the unexplained category were more likely to report other unexplained symptoms (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.5), pain at multiple sites (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.0-6.0), have multiple consultations (OR 5.2, 95% CI 2.1-13.0), report aching (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.8-8.2), nagging (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.4-7.0), unilateral (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-4.9) and bilateral pain (OR 9.7, 95% CI 2.1-45.2), which was worse when stressed (OR 15.7, 95% CI 4.2-57.9). They were also more likely to have experienced facial trauma (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.1-5.8). A multivariate analysis showed that the strongest predictors of unexplained oro-facial pain were age (being older), gender (female), aching, nagging pain which was worse on stress. In addition pain was more likely to be unilateral and reported at multiple sites. Conclusions:This study has shown that chronic symptoms (including chronic oro-facial pain) that are frequently unexplained co-occur in the general population and share common associated factors. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that chronic oro-facial pain may share a common aetiology with other frequently unexplained symptoms although this needs to be confirmed in a prospective study. In addition, the questionnaire based classification of unexplained oro-facial pain provides a useful tool to identify this condition where clinical examination is not feasible for example in population based studies which can now investigate the prevalence, aetiology and natural history of this condition.

Anodic growth of titanium oxide: Electrochemical behaviour and morphological evolution
The mechanism of growth of anodic titanium oxide in sulphuric acid has been investigated by potentiostatic and potentiodynamic anodizing, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. It was found that most of the charge passed during growth is consumed in oxygen evolution at the oxide-solution interface and the measured current relates to the electronic conduction properties of the oxide. Further, it was confirmed that an amorphous to crystalline transition takes place during potentiodynamic growth, and the transition triggers the additional generation of oxygen bubbles that occurs within the oxide. Depending on the growth conditions, the oxygen bubbles can rupture with local re-growth of the film then occurring. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The role of convexity in perception of symmetry and in visual short-term memory
Visual perception of shape is affected by coding of local convexities and concavities. For instance, a recent study reported that deviations from symmetry carried by convexities were easier to detect than deviations carried by concavities. We removed some confounds and extended this work from a detection of reflection of a contour (i.e., bilateral symmetry), to a detection of repetition of a contour (i.e.,
translational symmetry). We tested whether any convexity advantage is specific to bilateral symmetry in a two-interval (Experiment 1) and a single-interval (Experiment 2) detection task. In both, we found a convexity advantage only for repetition. When we removed the need to choose which region of the contour to monitor (Experiment 3) the effect disappeared. In a second series of studies, we again used shapes with multiple convex or concave features. Participants performed a change detection task in which only one of the features could change. We did not find any evidence that convexities are special in visual short-term memory, when the to-be-remembered features only changed shape (Experiment 4), when they changed shape and changed from concave to convex and vice versa (Experiment 5), or when these conditions were mixed (Experiment 6). We did find a small advantage for coding convexity as well as concavity over an isolated (and thus ambiguous) contour. The latter is consistent with the known effect of closure on processing of shape. We conclude that convexity plays a role in many perceptual tasks but that it does not have a basic encoding advantage over concavity.

Effect of imidazole antifungals on the development of germ tubes by strains of Candida albicans.
Three imidazole antifungals (ketoconazole, tioconazole and miconazole) were examined for their effect on germ tube development by synchronous blastospore populations and on actively growing germ tubes of three strains of Candida albicans. After incubation in serum for 4 h the largest differences in germ tube elongation between strains were detected at concentrations (0.005 mg/l) where minimal inhibition was observed. Germ tube elongation in antifungal-containing serum diminished with increasing concentration. Maximum inhibition occurred at concentrations of 0.5 mg/l. All three antifungals inhibited the rate of hyphal elongation by the strains over a 6 h period at this concentration. Tests where germinated blastospores of strain 3281 were transferred to serum containing 0.5 mg/l of antifungal indicated that all three drugs inhibited further elongation. However, the rate of inhibition was dependent upon the length of time germination had proceeded in serum alone prior to transfer to antifungal-containing serum.

[cell, tumor, cancer, growth, parasitic, host, energy, mitochondrium]

Energy transfer in "parasitic" cancer metabolism: mitochondria are the powerhouse and Achilles' heel of tumor cells.
It is now widely recognized that the tumor microenvironment promotes cancer cell growth and metastasis via changes in cytokine secretion and extracellular matrix remodeling. However, the role of tumor stromal cells in providing energy for epithelial cancer cell growth is a newly emerging paradigm. For example, we and others have recently proposed that tumor growth and metastasis is related to an energy imbalance. Host cells produce energy-rich nutrients via catabolism (through autophagy, mitophagy, and aerobic glycolysis), which are then transferred to cancer cells to fuel anabolic tumor growth. Stromal cell-derived L-lactate is taken up by cancer cells and is used for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to produce ATP efficiently. However, "parasitic" energy transfer may be a more generalized mechanism in cancer biology than previously appreciated. Two recent papers in Science and Nature Medicine now show that lipolysis in host tissues also fuels tumor growth. These studies demonstrate that free fatty acids produced by host cell lipolysis are re-used via beta-oxidation (beta-OX) in cancer cell mitochondria. Thus, stromal catabolites (such as lactate, ketones, glutamine and free fatty acids) promote tumor growth by acting as high-energy onco-metabolites. As such, host catabolism, via autophagy, mitophagy and lipolysis, may explain the pathogenesis of cancer-associated cachexia and provides exciting new druggable targets for novel therapeutic interventions. Taken together, these findings also suggest that tumor cells promote their own growth and survival by behaving as a "parasitic organism." Hence, we propose the term "Parasitic Cancer Metabolism" to describe this type of metabolic coupling in tumors. Targeting tumor cell mitochondria (OXPHOS and beta-OX) would effectively uncouple tumor cells from their hosts, leading to their acute starvation. In this context, we discuss new evidence that high-energy onco-metabolites (produced by the stroma) can confer drug resistance. Importantly, this metabolic chemo-resistance is reversed by blocking OXPHOS in cancer cell mitochondria with drugs like Metformin, a mitochondrial "poison." In summary, parasitic cancer metabolism is achieved architecturally by dividing tumor tissue into at least two well-defined opposing "metabolic compartments:" catabolic and anabolic.

Mobile Platforms for Underwater Sensor Networks
The production of clean water, the generation of nuclear power and the development of chemicals, petro-chemicals and pharmaceuticals all rely on liquid-based processes.  They are fundamental to modern society, however the real-time monitoring of such processes is an inherently difficult challenge which has not yet been satisfactorily solved.Current methods of monitoring include on- and off-line spot checks and industrial process tomography.  Neither of these methods provides the spatial or temporal resolution required to properly characterise the processes.  This research project proposes a new monitoring method for processes which can tolerate foreign objects; a mobile underwater sensor network (MUSN).An MUSN has the potential to increase both the spatial and temporal resolution of measurements and could be used in real-time.  The network would be formed by a number of mobile sensor platforms, in the form of micro-autonomous underwater vehicles (uAUVs) which would communicate using acoustics.  The demonstrator for the technology is for use in the monitoring of nuclear storage ponds.Current AUV technology is not suitable for use in enclosed environments such as storage ponds due to the size and maneuverability.  This thesis presents the research conducted in the development of a new vehicle uAUV.  The work presented covers the mechatronic aspects of the vehicle; the design of the hull, propulsion systems, corresponding control circuitry and basic motion control systems.  One of the main factors influencing the design of the vehicle has been cost.  If a large number of vehicles are used to form a network, the cost of an individual uAUV should be kept as low as possible.  This has raised a number of technical challenges as low-cost components are often of low-tolerance.  Imbalanced time-varying thrust, low manufacturing tolerances and noisy indirect sensor measurements for the control systems have all been overcome in the design of the vehicle.The outcome of the research is a fully functional prototype uAUV.  The vehicle is spherical in shape with a diameter of approximately 15cm, with six thruster units mounted around the equator (increasing the horizontal clearance to 20cm) to provide thrust in four degrees of freedom (surge, sway, heave and yaw).  The vehicle has a sensor suite which includes a pressure sensor, digital compass and a gyroscope which provide inputs to the motion control systems.  The controllers have been developed and implemented on the vehicle's custom built embedded system.  Experiments have been conducted showing that the uAUV is able to move in 3D with closed-loop control in heave and yaw.  Motion in surge and sway is open-loop, via a dead-reckoning system.

Does p40-targeted therapy represent a significant evolution in the management of plaque psoriasis?
The recognition of the roles of interleukins (IL)-12 and IL-23 in the development of psoriasis is an important advance in the understanding, and the subsequent management, of this chronic inflammatory disease. Two human anti-p40 monoclonal antibodies targeting both IL-12 and IL-23 via their shared p40 subunit have been developed: briakinumab and ustekinumab. Recent Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials have illustrated the benefits of briakinumab (in Phase 3 clinical development) and ustekinumab (approved in the EU, and also in other territories worldwide) in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Available data indicate that a strategy targeting the IL-12 p40 subunit has considerable advantages over targeting of tumour necrosis factor-α, offering rapid onset of efficacy with a favourable dosing regimen (every 12 weeks for ustekinumab). Registries incorporating rigorous pharmacovigilance are now required to further understand the clinical profile of these drugs over long-term use.

Using Caveolin-1 epithelial immunostaining patterns to stratify human breast cancer patients and predict the Caveolin-1 (P132L) mutation.
Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) mutations, such as P132L, are associated with ER-positive human breast cancers. However, no immunohistochemical methods have yet been described to predict the presence of Cav-1 mutations in human breast cancer. Since the P132L mutation acts in a dominant-negative fashion and causes the mis-localization of Cav-1 in cultured cells in vitro, we hypothesized that of patients carrying this mutation would show a similar Cav-1 staining pattern in vivo. Indeed, while performing histological analysis of Cav-1 immunostaining on human breast cancer samples, we noted the emergence of two distinct epithelial staining patterns: (1) punctate peri-nuclear "Golgi-like" localization; or (2) diffuse cytoplasmic staining. The punctate peri-nuclear staining pattern was associated with ER-alpha positivity and was present mainly in well-differentiated samples. In striking contrast, the diffuse staining pattern was present in poorly differentiated samples, and was not associated with ER-status. DNA sequence analysis revealed that only well-differentiated samples with a punctate staining pattern harbored the Cav-1 P132L mutation. Thus, immunostaining of Cav-1 can be used as a first step to stratify human breast cancer patients and to predict the presence of Cav-1 mutations. As such, the punctate Cav-1 immunostaining pattern can now be used as a screening tool to select patients for Cav-1 mutational analysis.

Evolution of trace gases and particles emitted by a chaparral fire in California
Biomass burning (BB) is a major global source of trace gases and particles. Accurately representing the production and evolution of these emissions is an important goal for atmospheric chemical transport models. We measured a suite of gases and aerosols emitted from an 81 hectare prescribed fire in chaparral fuels on the central coast of California, US on 17 November 2009. We also measured physical and chemical changes that occurred in the isolated down-wind plume in the first similar to 4 h after emission. The measurements were carried out onboard a Twin Otter aircraft outfitted with an airborne Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (AFTIR), aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS), single particle soot photometer (SP2), nephelometer, LiCor CO2 analyzer, a chemiluminescence ozone instrument, and a wing-mounted meteorological probe. Our measurements included: CO2; CO; NOx; NH3; non-methane organic compounds; organic aerosol (OA); inorganic aerosol (nitrate, ammonium, sulfate, and chloride); aerosol light scattering; refractory black carbon (rBC); and ambient temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, and three-dimensional wind velocity. The molar ratio of excess O-3 to excess CO in the plume (Delta O-3/Delta CO) increased from -5.13 (+/- 1.13) x 10(-3) to 10.2 (+/- 2.16) x 10(-2) in similar to 4.5 h following smoke emission. Excess acetic and formic acid (normalized to excess CO) increased by factors of 1.73 +/- 0.43 and 7.34 +/- 3.03 (respectively) over the same time since emission. Based on the rapid decay of C2H4 we infer an in-plume average OH concentration of 5.27 (+/- 0.97) x 10(6) molec cm(-3), consistent with previous studies showing elevated OH concentrations in biomass burning plumes. Ammonium, nitrate, and sulfate all increased over the course of 4 h. The observed ammonium increase was a factor of 3.90 +/- 2.93 in about 4 h, but accounted for just similar to 36\% of the gaseous ammonia lost on a molar basis. Some of the gas phase NH3 loss may have been due to condensation on, or formation of, particles below the AMS detection range. NOx was converted to PAN and particle nitrate with PAN production being about two times greater than production of observable nitrate in the first similar to 4 h following emission. The excess aerosol light scattering in the plume (normalized to excess CO2) increased by a factor of 2.50 +/- 0.74 over 4 h. The increase in light scattering was similar to that observed in an earlier study of a biomass burning plume in Mexico where significant secondary formation of OA closely tracked the increase in scattering. In the California plume, however, Delta OA/Delta CO2 decreased sharply for the first hour and then increased slowly with a net decrease of similar to 20\% over 4 h. The fraction of thickly coated rBC particles increased up to similar to 85\% over the 4 h aging period. Decreasing OA accompanied by increased scattering/particle coating in initial aging may be due to a combination of particle coagulation and evaporation processes. Recondensation of species initially evaporated from the particles may have contributed to the subsequent slow rise in OA. We compare our results to observations from other plume aging studies and suggest that differences in environmental factors such as smoke concentration, oxidant concentration, actinic flux, and RH contribute significantly to the variation in plume evolution observations.

[stat-1, cell, dna]

STAT-1 interacts with p53 to enhance DNA damage-induced apoptosis.
The STAT-1 transcription factor has been implicated as a tumor suppressor by virtue of its ability to inhibit cell growth and promoting apoptosis. However, the mechanisms by which STAT-1 mediates these effects remain unclear. Using human and mouse STAT-1-deficient cells, we show here that STAT-1 is required for optimal DNA damage-induced apoptosis. The basal level of the p53 inhibitor Mdm2 is increased in STAT-1(-/-) cells, suggesting that STAT-1 is a negative regulator of Mdm2 expression. Correspondingly, both basal p53 levels, and those induced by DNA damage were lower in STAT-1(-/-) cells. In agreement with this lower p53 response to DNA damage in cells lacking STAT-1, the induction of p53 responsive genes, such as Bax, Noxa, and Fas, was reduced in STAT-1-deficient cells. Conversely, STAT-1 overexpression enhances transcription of these genes, an effect that is abolished if the p53 response element in their promoters is mutated. Moreover, STAT-1 interacts directly with p53, an association, which is enhanced following DNA damage. Therefore, in addition to negatively regulating Mdm2, STAT-1 also acts as a coactivator for p53. Hence STAT-1 is another member of a growing family of protein partners able to modulate the p53-activated apoptotic pathway.

Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist reverses stroke-associated peripheral immune suppression.
INTRODUCTION: Infections are common following stroke and adversely affect outcome. Cellular immune suppression associated with acute stroke may increase susceptibility to infection. Cytokines are important contributors to both stroke pathology and the response to infection. Since interleukin (IL)-1 blockade is a candidate treatment for cerebral ischemia, we examined whether administration of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) to patients with acute stroke affected innate cellular immune responses in a phase II placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: Venous blood samples were taken prior to treatment initiation, at 24h and 5 to 7d. Blood was also drawn from stroke-free controls. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of whole-blood cultures assessed the potential of leukocytes to produce cytokines. RESULTS: Induction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 by LPS was significantly reduced in patients at admission, compared to controls. At 24h, cytokine induction remained suppressed in the placebo group. In contrast, for patients treated with IL-1Ra, induction of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 was similar to controls and IL-1β induction was significantly greater than in the placebo group. At 5 to 7d, TNF-α and IL-1β induction remained suppressed only in the placebo group (p<0.05). Plasma cortisol concentrations, elevated at admission in patients compared to controls, were substantially reduced at 24h in the patients receiving IL-1Ra (p<0.05) and inversely correlated (p<0.001) with either TNF-α (r=-0.71) or IL-1β induction (r=-0.67) at admission. CONCLUSION: Treatment with IL-1Ra reverses peripheral innate immune suppression in the acute phase of stroke, which is associated with attenuated cortisol production. The mechanisms underlying these observations, including the potential impact of IL-1Ra on stroke severity and the clinical significance of immune suppression, require further evaluation in larger studies.

[tumor, autophagy, cell, cancer, stroma, energy, systemic, cachexium, epithelial]

The autophagic tumor stroma model of cancer or "battery-operated tumor growth": A simple solution to the autophagy paradox.
The role of autophagy in tumorigenesis is controversial. Both autophagy inhibitors (chloroquine) and autophagy promoters (rapamycin) block tumorigenesis by unknown mechanism(s). This is called the "Autophagy Paradox". We have recently reported a simple solution to this paradox. We demonstrated that epithelial cancer cells use oxidative stress to induce autophagy in the tumor microenvironment. As a consequence, the autophagic tumor stroma generates recycled nutrients that can then be used as chemical building blocks by anabolic epithelial cancer cells. This model results in a net energy transfer from the tumor stroma to epithelial cancer cells (an energy imbalance), thereby promoting tumor growth. This net energy transfer is both unilateral and vectorial, from the tumor stroma to the epithelial cancer cells, representing a true host-parasite relationship. We have termed this new paradigm "The Autophagic Tumor Stroma Model of Cancer Cell Metabolism" or "Battery-Operated Tumor Growth". In this sense, autophagy in the tumor stroma serves as a "battery" to fuel tumor growth, progression and metastasis, independently of angiogenesis. Using this model, the systemic induction of autophagy will prevent epithelial cancer cells from using recycled nutrients, while the systemic inhibiton of autophagy will prevent stromal cells from producing recycled nutrients-both effectively "starving" cancer cells. We discuss the idea that tumor cells could become resistant to the systemic induction of autophagy, by the upregulation of natural endogenous autophagy inhibitors in cancer cells. Alternatively, tumor cells could also become resistant to the systemic induction of autophagy, by the genetic silencing/deletion of pro-autophagic molecules, such as Beclin1. If autophagy resistance develops in cancer cells, then the systemic inhibition of autophagy would provide a therapeutic solution to this type of drug resistance, as it would still target autophagy in the tumor stroma. As such, an anti-cancer therapy that combines the alternating use of both autophagy promoters and autophagy inhibitors would be expected to prevent the onset of drug resistance. We also discuss why anti-angiogenic therapy has been found to promote tumor recurrence, progression and metastasis. More specifically, anti-angiogenic therapy would induce autophagy in the tumor stroma via the induction of stromal hypoxia, thereby converting a non-aggressive tumor type to a "lethal" aggressive tumor phenotype. Thus, uncoupling the metabolic parasitic relationship between cancer cells and an autophagic tumor stroma may hold great promise for anti-cancer therapy. Finally, we believe that autophagy in the tumor stroma is the local microscopic counterpart of systemic wasting (cancer-associated cachexia), which is associated with advanced and metastatic cancers. Cachexia in cancer patients is not due to decreased energy intake, but instead involves an increased basal metabolic rate and increased energy expenditures, resulting in a negative energy balance. Importantly, when tumors were surgically excised, this increased metabolic rate returned to normal levels. This view of cachexia, resulting in energy transfer to the tumor, is consistent with our hypothesis. So, cancer-associated cachexia may start locally as stromal autophagy, and then spread systemically. As such, stromal autophagy may be the requisite precursor of systemic cancer-associated cachexia.

[aptamer, heparanase, enzyme, tumour, assay, cell, hpse1]

Development of novel single-stranded nucleic acid aptamers against the pro-angiogenic and metastatic enzyme heparanase (HPSE1).
Heparanase is an enzyme involved in extracellular matrix remodelling and heparan sulphate proteoglycan catabolism. It is secreted by metastatic tumour cells, allowing them to penetrate the endothelial cell layer and basement membrane to invade target organs. The release of growth factors at the site of cleaved heparan sulphate chains further enhance the potential of the tumour by encouraging the process of angiogenesis. This leads to increased survival and further proliferation of the tumour. Aptamers are single or double stranded oligonucleotides that recognise specific small molecules, peptides, proteins, or even cells or tissues and have shown great potential over the years as diagnostic and therapeutic agents in anticancer treatment. For the first time, single stranded DNA aptamers were successfully generated against the active heterodimer form of heparanase using a modified SELEX protocol, and eluted based on increasing affinity for the target. Sandwich ELISA assays showed recognition of heparanase by the aptamers at a site distinct from that of a polyclonal HPSE1 antibody. The binding affinities of aptamer to immobilised enzyme were high (7 × 10(7) to 8 × 10(7) M(-1)) as measured by fluorescence spectroscopy. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that the aptamers were able to recognise heparanase with staining comparable or in some cases superior to that of the HPSE1 antibody control. Finally, matrigel assay demonstrated that aptamers were able to inhibit heparanase. This study provides clear proof of principle concept that nucleic acid aptamers can be generated against heparanase. These reagents may serve as useful tools to explore the functional role of the enzyme and in the future development of diagnostic assays or therapeutic reagents.

[research, educational, role, learning, psychologist]

The role of the educational psychologist; perspectives on learning.
This thesis is a collation of three research papers, each of which explores an area of professional relevance to the practitioner educational psychologist.  The research is undertaken in the context of a large, rural Local Authority and is related to the broad theme of cognition and learning in children and young people.   The researcher adopts a Q-methodology to consider the subjective and collective viewpoints of educational psychologists in the Local Authority with regard to dyslexia and using factor analysis to process the data, three distinct viewpoints emerged.  The literature review included in the thesis seeks to provide an overview of the research base which underpins formative assessment practices in educational settings in the UK.  The importance of the role of teacher feedback in classroom learning is illustrated through meta-analyses research and studies.  Formative assessment is considered in the review within the conceptual framework of constructivist learning theory.  The role of pupil feedback in a junior classroom is then explored in a qualitative research study using a collaborative action research methodology.  Thematic analysis is used to analyse the textual data from interviews with the participant teacher.  The action research methodology was an effective model to enable the teacher to effect change in her practice.  The three papers are set within an organisational context in the thesis, current challenges for the profession are summarised and many examples are given of the role and importance of research in the work of an educational psychologist.    Implications for further research within the profession of educational psychology are suggested.

[diazepam, breathlessness, promethazine, exercise, tolerance, patient]

Drug treatment of breathlessness: contrasting effects of diazepam and promethazine in pink puffers.
Fifteen out of 18 "pink and puffing" patients completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial of diazepam and promethazine for breathlessness and reduced exercise tolerance. Dosages were 25 mg and 125 mg daily, respectively, and each course lasted two weeks. Patients with psychiatric or other major medical histories were excluded. Of the three patients who did not complete the trial, one died during an exacerbation of breathlessness while taking diazepam, one was withdrawn because of mild hypercapnia while taking placebo, and one suffered intolerable drowsiness while taking diazepam. Of the remaining 15 patients, six needed a reduction in dosage because of drowsiness: one of these was taking promethazine and five diazepam. Diazepam had no effect on breathlessness and noticeably reduced exercise tolerance. Promethazine reduced breathlessness and improved exercise tolerance without altering lung function. From these results diazepam is contraindicated for breathlessness and reduced exercise tolerance in fixed airways obstruction, but promethazine may be beneficial.

Controlled trial of pyrogastrone and cimetidine in the treatment of reflux oesophagitis.
Eighty patients with reflux oesophagitis were randomised to receive either Pyrogastrone five tablets daily or cimetidine 400 mg twice daily for six weeks, extended to 12 if necessary. At six weeks, 49% of the Pyrogastrone treated subjects and 37% of the cimetidine treated subjects were healed. After 12 weeks the cumulative healing rates were 64% for Pyrogastrone and 66% for cimetidine. Compared with baseline both drugs achieved similarly significant improvements in symptom score, endoscopic and histological grading even in those who did not heal completely. Response was not related to length of symptoms or initial severity of oesophagitis. Eleven of 25 (44%) patients healed with Pyrogastrone relapsed within one year compared with 15 of 27 (56%) healed with cimetidine. Although this trend in favour of Pyrogastrone was not significant at one year the early relapse rate was significantly greater in cimetidine treated subjects. At six weeks, five cimetidine treated subjects had relapsed compared with none in the Pyrogastrone group (p = 0.05). This study shows that Pyrogastrone and cimetidine are equally effective in the healing of oesophagitis and raises the possibility that Pyrogastrone has marginal benefits in terms of time to relapse.

[mucin, locus, cf, level, sulphur, source, expression, growth, sulphate, transcriptional]

Utilisation of mucin sulphur by Pseudomonas aeruginosa- Importance for cystic fibrosis
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of chronic respiratory infection in cystic fibrosis (CF). Infection is established within the lung epithelial mucus layer, through adhesion to mucins. Terminal residues on mucin oligosaccharide chains are highly sulphated and sialylated, which increases their resistance to degradation by bacterial enzymes. However, a number of microbes display mucin sulphatase activity, including P. aeruginosa. Using ion chromatography, the levels of sulphation on different respiratory mucins and the availability of inorganic sulphate in CF sputum were quantified, and the ability of clinical P. aeruginosa isolates to desulphate mucin was tested by providing mucin as a sole sulphur source for growth. All tested P. aeruginosa strains isolated from the CF lung were able to use human respiratory mucin as source of sulphur for growth, whereas other non-clinical Pseudomonas species were not. However, measured levels of inorganic sulphate in CF sputum suggest that bacteria resident in the lung have sufficient inorganic sulphate for growth and are unlikely to require access to mucin-sulphur as a sulphur source during chronic infection. This was confirmed when expression of sulphate-repressed P. aeruginosa genes, atsK and msuE, were found by quantitative PCR to be repressed in CF sputum. These results indicate that sulphate-starvation is unlikely to occur in pathogens residing in CF sputum and, therefore, mucin desulphation may have an alternative purpose in the association between P. aeruginosa and CF airways.Transcriptomic studies showed enhanced expression of 5 main islands on the P. aeruginosa genome in the presence of mucin as a sulphur source, when compared to sulphate. These islands include general sulphur-starvation response gene clusters, encoding desulphurizing enzymes AtsA, SsuD and MsuD, plus the locus PA2083-PA2094. This locus has not been characterised but encodes a putative sulphonatase, an extracellular-function (ECF) type sigma factor, with associated TonB-dependent transducer, and Major Facilitator Superfamily transporters. Transcriptional studies of this locus in response to various sulphur sources revealed that the locus comprises two transcriptional units under sulphate-limited conditions, and putative σ70-type promoters were identified using 5’-RACE and sequence alignment. Transcriptional regulation of the locus is contributed to by the encoded ECF-type σ factor and anti-σ factor, as a mutant carrying only a disrupted copy of these genes displayed a lack of transcriptional downregulation of the locus in the presence of sulphate. The influence of mucin on transcription levels of the locus was also investigated by RT-qPCR, showing that for maximum transcriptional levels both sulphate-limitation and the presence of mucin are required. However, despite repression of P. aeruginosa sulphate-regulated genes in CF sputum, the level of expression of the locus PA2083-PA2094 in CF sputum was comparable to that of P. aeruginosa culture grown in sulphate-limited conditions. The influence of the lung environment may, therefore, have a greater impact on expression levels of the locus than seen in in vitro studies with mucin. To further investigate the role of the locus, mutants were constructed and screened for changes in their ability to utilise a range of sulphur sources, including mucin, for growth. However, none of the mutants showed significant change in their growth patterns in response to any of the other sulphur sources tested, suggesting that the locus may be involved in desulphurization of a compound not tested in this study or may be functionally replaced by other organosulphur utilisation pathways in its absence. With the aim of identifying genes involved in mucin desulphurization, a P. aeruginosa transposon library was generated, combining the high-throughput nature of a random library with the variable expression reporter capabilities afforded by a promoterless GFP insert. The GFP reporter transposon produced varying fluorescence levels over time during growth of individual mutants, based on the activity of the promoter upstream of the transposon insertion site. A preliminary method was devised using fluorescence-activated cell-sorting to isolate mutants displaying altered GFP expression levels in response to sulphate availability and to mucin. Overall, this work explores the prevalence and importance of mucin desulphurization by P. aeruginosa, with relation to cystic fibrosis lungs, and provides some insight into the transcriptional patterns of the P. aeruginosa locus PA2083 to PA2094.

[cyp19a1, patient, allele, ai, metastatic, aromatase, repeat, variant, gene]

Polymorphisms of CYP19A1 and response to aromatase inhibitors in metastatic breast cancer patients.
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene encoding aromatase (CYP19A1) have been associated with differential benefit from letrozole treatment in metastatic breast cancer (mBC) patients, but validation is lacking. The aim was to investigate whether polymorphic variation of CYP19A1 and enzymes involved in estrogen and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) metabolism are associated with efficacy of AIs. 308 Women with estrogen-receptor-positive metastatic mBC treated with a third-generation AI were identified retrospectively. DNA was extracted from archival formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumors and genotyped for 71 variants in 16 candidate genes, including CYP19A1. Time to treatment failure (TTF) was significantly improved in patients carrying the minor (T) allele of rs4775936 when compared to patients with the reference allele HR = 0.79 per T allele (0.66-0.95); P = 0.012. Patients with >7 TTTA repeats on either allele of CYP19A1 intron 4 had a lower risk of failure than those with a smaller repeat size HR = 0.84 per >7 TTTA repeats (0.7-0.99); P = 0.04. However, importantly in multivariate analysis, adjusting for the number of disease sites; disease-free interval from diagnosis to first recurrence, grade at diagnosis and first recurrence type neither variant maintained independent predictive significance. None of the 56 SNPs analyzed as an exploratory set showed significant association with TTF. Variants in CYP19A1 or other selected genes associated with AI metabolism were not independently associated with improved AI efficacy and emphasize the importance in pharmacogenetic studies of considering genetic biomarkers in the context of relevant prognostic factors.

[negative, symptom, minocycline, tau, early, placebo, schizophrenia]

Minocycline benefits negative symptoms in early schizophrenia: a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients on standard treatment.
The onset and early course of schizophrenia is associated with subtle loss of grey matter which may be responsible for the evolution and persistence of symptoms such as apathy, emotional blunting, and social withdrawal. Such 'negative' symptoms are unaffected by current antipsychotic therapies. There is evidence that the antibiotic minocycline has neuroprotective properties. We investigated whether the addition of minocycline to treatment as usual (TAU) for 1 year in early psychosis would reduce negative symptoms compared with placebo. In total, 144 participants within 5 years of first onset in Brazil and Pakistan were randomised to receive TAU plus placebo or minocycline. The primary outcome measures were the negative and positive syndrome ratings using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Some 94 patients completed the trial. The mean improvement in negative symptoms for the minocycline group was 9.2 and in the placebo group 4.7, an adjusted difference of 3.53 (s.e. 1.01) 95% CI: 1.55, 5.51; p < 0.001 in the intention-to-treat population. The effect was present in both countries. The addition of minocycline to TAU early in the course of schizophrenia predominantly improves negative symptoms. Whether this is mediated by neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory or others actions is under investigation.

Patient safety, satisfaction, and quality of hospital care: cross sectional surveys of nurses and patients in 12 countries in Europe and the United States
Objective To determine whether hospitals with a good organisation of care (such as improved nurse staffing and work environments) can affect patient care and nurse workforce stability in European countries.Design Cross sectional surveys of patients and nurses.Setting Nurses were surveyed in general acute care hospitals (488 in 12 European countries; 617 in the United States); patients were surveyed in 210 European hospitals and 430 US hospitals.Participants 33 659 nurses and 11 318 patients in Europe; 27 509 nurses and more than 120 000 patients in the US.Main outcome measures Nurse outcomes (hospital staffing, work environments, burnout, dissatisfaction, intention to leave job in the next year, patient safety, quality of care), patient outcomes (satisfaction overall and with nursing care, willingness to recommend hospitals).Results The percentage of nurses reporting poor or fair quality of patient care varied substantially by country (from 11% (Ireland) to 47% (Greece)), as did rates for nurses who gave their hospital a poor or failing safety grade (4% (Switzerland) to 18% (Poland)). We found high rates of nurse burnout (10% (Netherlands) to 78% (Greece)), job dissatisfaction (11% (Netherlands) to 56% (Greece)), and intention to leave (14% (US) to 49% (Finland, Greece)). Patients’ high ratings of their hospitals also varied considerably (35% (Spain) to 61% (Finland, Ireland)), as did rates of patients willing to recommend their hospital (53% (Greece) to 78% (Switzerland)). Improved work environments and reduced ratios of patients to nurses were associated with increased care quality and patient satisfaction. In European hospitals, after adjusting for hospital and nurse characteristics, nurses with better work environments were half as likely to report poor or fair care quality (adjusted odds ratio 0.56, 95% confidence interval 0.51 to 0.61) and give their hospitals poor or failing grades on patient safety (0.50, 0.44 to 0.56). Each additional patient per nurse increased the odds of nurses reporting poor or fair quality care (1.11, 1.07 to 1.15) and poor or failing safety grades (1.10, 1.05 to 1.16). Patients in hospitals with better work environments were more likely to rate their hospital highly (1.16, 1.03 to 1.32) and recommend their hospitals (1.20, 1.05 to 1.37), whereas those with higher ratios of patients to nurses were less likely to rate them highly (0.94, 0.91 to 0.97) or recommend them (0.95, 0.91 to 0.98). Results were similar in the US. Nurses and patients agreed on which hospitals provided good care and could be recommended.Conclusions Deficits in hospital care quality were common in all countries. Improvement of hospital work environments might be a relatively low cost strategy to improve safety and quality in hospital care and to increase patient satisfaction.

[bifurcation, stent, sideguard, sb, lesion, limitation, ostium]

Use of the Sideguard (Cappella) stent in bifurcation lesions: a real-world experience.
AIMS: The Sideguard® stent (Cappella Medical Devices Ltd, Galway, Ireland), is a novel nitinol self-expanding dedicated bifurcation stent that flares proximally at the ostium of the side branch (SB) into a trumpet shape thereby achieving full ostial coverage. The aim of this study is to report the utility and limitations of this stent in patients undergoing treatment to bifurcation coronary lesions in a real-world setting. METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively identified 20 successive patients admitted over a 6-month period in whom there was significant SB disease and who were suitable for a bifurcation procedure. The Sideguard® stent was successfully used in all 20 cases including several that would have been technically difficult using conventional bifurcation techniques. We highlight use of this system using five illustrative cases that illustrate its utility and limitations in the treatment of bifurcation lesions. CONCLUSIONS: The Sideguard® stent can be used to treat complex bifurcation lesions in a straight forward manner and is not subject to the limitations associated with conventional bifurcation PCI techniques including jailing of the SB ostium and inability to fully cover/scaffold the ostium of the SB.

Improving stroke care through action research.
Stroke accounts for approximately 20% of beds occupied on general medical wards yet nurses felt inadequately prepared to participate fully in the interdisciplinary approach to stroke rehabilitation. An action research project was established to improve stroke care and rehabilitation in a general medical ward. Results indicate a correlation between knowledge and attitudes: the greater the nurse's understanding the more positive the nurse is towards nursing involvement in rehabilitation. It was concluded that nurses have a vital part to play in the rehabilitation of stroke patients and that their contribution can be enhanced through greater understanding. Further research is needed to determine the effects of greater nursing involvement in terms of quality of patient recovery and length of patient stay.

Further delineation of the phenotype of severe congenital neutropenia type 4 due to mutations in G6PC3.
Severe congenital neutropenia type 4 (SCN4) is an autosomal recessive condition, which was defined recently with identification of the causative mutations in G6PC3. To date there are only three reports in the literature describing patients with SCN4 with mutations in the G6PC3 gene. We report four individuals with SCN4 who belong to a single large consanguineous kindred. We provide an overview of the non-haematological features of the condition with a focus on the adult phenotype, which has not been previously described in detail. We show that the superficial venous changes seen in SCN4 patients can develop into varicose veins and venous ulcers in adulthood. We review the range of congenital anomalies associated with SCN4. We demonstrate that secundum atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus and valvular defects are the most frequent cardiac anomalies in SCN4. Drawing parallels with type 1 glycogen storage disease, we propose that poor growth of prenatal onset, mild-to-moderate learning disability, primary pulmonary hypertension, delayed or incomplete puberty, hypothyroidism and dysmorphism likely represent features of this syndrome. We also suggest monitoring for lipid anomalies, and kidney and liver function in affected patients. Delineation of the SCN4 phenotype may help in appropriate treatment and management and provide further insights into the pathogenesis of this multisystem disease.

[tumor, fibroblast, cav-1, cancer, deficient, oxidative, human, model, cell, stress]

Caveolin-1 and mitochondrial SOD2 (MnSOD) function as tumor suppressors in the stromal microenvironment: a new genetically tractable model for human cancer associated fibroblasts.
We have recently proposed a new model for understanding tumor metabolism, termed: "The Autophagic Tumor Stroma Model of Cancer Metabolism". In this new paradigm, catabolism (autophagy) in the tumor stroma fuels the anabolic growth of aggressive cancer cells. Mechanistically, tumor cells induce autophagy in adjacent cancer-associated fibroblasts via the loss of caveolin-1 (Cav-1), which is sufficient to promote oxidative stress in stromal fibroblasts. To further test this hypothesis, here we created human Cav-1 deficient immortalized fibroblasts using a targeted sh-RNA knock-down approach. Relative to control fibroblasts, Cav-1 deficient fibroblasts dramatically promoted tumor growth in xenograft assays employing an aggressive human breast cancer cell line, namely MDA-MB-231 cells. Co-injection of Cav-1 deficient fibroblasts, with MDA-MB-231 cells, increased both tumor mass and tumor volume by ~4-fold. Immuno-staining with CD31 indicated that this paracrine tumor promoting effect was clearly independent of angiogenesis. Mechanistically, proteomic analysis of these human Cav-1 deficient fibroblasts identified > 40 protein biomarkers that were upregulated, most of which were associated with i) myofibroblast differentiation, or ii) oxidative stress/hypoxia. In direct support of these findings, the tumor promoting effects of Cav-1 deficient fibroblasts could be functionally suppressed (nearly 2-fold) by the recombinant over-expression of SOD2 (superoxide dismutase 2), a known mitochondrial enzyme that de-activates superoxide, thereby reducing mitochondrial oxidative stress. In contrast, cytoplasmic soluble SOD1 had no effect, further highlighting a specific role for mitochondrial oxidative stress in this process. In summary, here we provide new evidence directly supporting a key role for a loss of stromal Cav-1 expression and oxidative stress in cancer-associated fibroblasts, in promoting tumor growth, which is consistent with "The Autophagic Tumor Stroma Model of Cancer". The human Cav-1 deficient fibroblasts that we have generated are a new genetically tractable model system for identifying other suppressors of the cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype, via a genetic "complementation" approach. This has important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of triple negative and basal breasts cancers, as well as tamoxifen-resistance in ER+ breast cancers, which are all associated with a Cav-1 deficient "lethal" tumor micro-environment, driving poor clinical outcome.

Reconfigurations and diffusion of trivacancy in silicon
Disappearance of the divacancy (V2) and trivacancy (V3) complexes upon isochronal and isothermal annealing of electron irradiated Si:O crystals has been studied by means of deep level transient spectroscopy. The annealing studies have shown that the V2 and V3 defects are mobile in Si at T>200 °C and in oxygen-rich material are trapped by interstitial oxygen atoms so resulting in the appearance of V2O and V3O defects. The activation energies for diffusion of the V2 and V3 centers have been determined. Density functional modeling calculations have been carried out to investigate the migration and reorientation mechanisms of V3 in large silicon supercells. It is proposed that these comprise a sequence of transformations between V3(D3) and V3(C2v) configurations.

Silver treatments for leg ulcers: a systematic review.
To determine the quantity and quality of current research on the effectiveness of silver-based dressings and topical agents for the treatment of leg ulcers, this paper presents a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) looking at the effects of silver-based dressings and topical agents on leg ulcer healing. Electronic databases were searched up to May 2006 for relevant randomized controlled trials. Journals and conference proceedings were also searched. The methodological quality of selected trials was assessed and statistical pooling of the results from similar studies undertaken. Rate of healing, proportion of ulcers completely healed and change in ulcer size were observed. Nine studies were considered eligible for inclusion. These studies varied in terms of the types of leg ulcers treated, interventions used, and outcomes assessed. Studies provided inconsistent evidence regarding the effects of silver-based dressings and topical agents on leg ulcer healing. Studies generally provided poor evidence due to a lack of statistical power, poor study designs, and incomplete reporting. In conclusion, the current evidence base on the use of these silver-based products on leg ulcers is limited, both in terms of the quantity available and the quality of the evidence. This review highlights the need for further, more rigorous research to be carried out before the use of these silver-based interventions in routine leg ulcer management is supported.

This gap in our knowledge puts us at a distinct disadvantage in designing therapeutics for certain immune-mediated diseases. However, progress is being made with the identification of novel endogenous tissue factors that can enhance Th2 induction by DCs.

Interaction of mesoscopic magnetic textures with superconductors
Here we report a method to calculate the vortex and magnetization arrangement for a system of interacting superconductors and ferromagnets separated in space. The method is based on static London-Maxwell equations and the corresponding energy. Possible superconducting vortices are included in this system. Using this method we analyze screening currents in a superconducting film induced by magnetic textures in a thin magnetic film. We assume that the two films are parallel and positioned close to each to other, but interact exclusively via magnetic fields. We also consider possible vortices within this superconducting film and their interactions with magnetic texture. As an example of such magnetic texture we use a single magnetic dot with magnetization either perpendicular or parallel to the film. We derive a condition where spontaneous formation of one, two, or more vortices and antivortices is energetically favorable. We prove that, in the case of such a circular magnetic dot with perpendicular magnetization, when the vortex emerges in the superconducting film the normal component of magnetic field near the superconducting film changes sign outside of the dot range.

Molecular analysis and biochemical classification of TDP-43 proteinopathy.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa pathology are progressive neurodegenerative diseases that are characterized by intracytoplasmic aggregates of hyperphosphorylated TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa. These TAR DNA-binding protein 43 proteinopathies can be classified into subtypes, which are closely correlated with clinicopathological phenotypes, although the differences in the molecular species of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 in these diseases and the biological significance thereof, remain to be clarified. Here, we have shown that although the banding patterns of abnormally phosphorylated C-terminal fragments of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 differ between the neuropathological subtypes, these are indistinguishable between multiple brain regions and spinal cord in individual patients. Immunoblot analysis of protease-resistant TAR DNA-binding protein 43 demonstrated that the fragment patterns represent different conformations of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 molecular species in the diseases. These results suggest a new clinicopathological classification of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 proteinopathies based on their molecular properties.

How Design Plays Strategic Roles in Internet Service Innovation: Lessons from Korean Companies
<p>In order to survive in the highly competitive internet business, companies have to provide differentiated services that can satisfy the rapidly changing users’ tastes and needs. Designers have been increasingly committed to achieving user satisfaction by generating and visualizing innovative solutions in new internet service development. The roles of internet service design have expanded from a narrow focus on aesthetics into a more strategic aspect. This paper investigates the methods of managing design in order to enhance companies’ competitiveness in internet business. The main research processes are to: (1) explore the current state of internet service design in Korea through in-depth interviews with professional designers and survey questionnaires to 30 digital design agencies and 60 clients; (2) compare how design is managed between in-house design groups and digital design agencies though the case studies of five Korean companies; and (3) develop a taxonomy characterizing four roles of designers in conjunction with the levels of their strategic contributions to internet service innovation: visualist, solution provider, concept generator, and service initiator. In addition, we demonstrate the growing contributions of the strategic use of design for innovating internet services, building robust brand equity, and increasing business performance.

[word, patient, semantic, speech]

Broadly speaking: Vocabulary in semantic dementia shifts towards general, semantically diverse words
One of the cardinal features of semantic dementia (SD) is a steady reduction in expressive vocabulary. We investigated the nature of this breakdown by assessing the psycholinguistic characteristics of words produced spontaneously by SD patients during an autobiographical memory interview. Speech was analysed with respect to frequency and imageability, and a recently-developed measure called semantic diversity. This measure quantifies the degree to which a word can be used in a broad range of different linguistic contexts. We used this measure in a formal exploration of the tendency for SD patients to replace specific terms with more vague and general words, on the assumption that more specific words are used in a more constrained set of contexts. Relative to healthy controls, patients were less likely to produce low-frequency, high-imageability words, and more likely to produce highly frequent, abstract words. These changes in the lexical-semantic landscape were related to semantic diversity: the highly frequent and abstract words most prevalent in the patients’ speech were also the most semantically diverse. In fact, when the speech samples of healthy controls were artificially engineered such that low semantic diversity words (e.g., garage, spanner) were replaced with broader terms (e.g., place, thing), the characteristics of their speech production came to closely resemble that of SD patients. A similar simulation in which low frequency words were replaced was less successful in replicating the patient data. These findings indicate systematic biases in the deterioration of lexical-semantic space in SD. As conceptual knowledge degrades, speech increasingly consists of general terms that can be applied in a broad range of linguistic contexts and convey less specific information.

Potential Functional Replacement of the Plastidic Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase Subunit (accD) Gene by Recent Transfers to the Nucleus in Some Angiosperm Lineages
Eukaryotic cells originated when an ancestor of the nucleated cell engulfed bacterial endosymbionts that gradually evolved into the mitochondrion and the chloroplast. Soon after these endosymbiotic events, thousands of ancestral prokaryotic genes were functionally transferred from the endosymbionts to the nucleus. This process of functional gene relocation, now rare in eukaryotes, continues in angiosperms. In this article, we show that the chloroplastic accD gene that is present in the plastome of most angiosperms has been functionally relocated to the nucleus in the Campanulaceae. Surprisingly, the nucleus-encoded accD transcript is considerably smaller than the plastidic version, consisting of little more than the carboxylase domain of the plastidic accD gene fused to a coding region encoding a plastid targeting peptide. We verified experimentally the presence of a chloroplastic transit peptide by showing that the product of the nuclear accD fused to GFP was imported in the chloroplasts. The nuclear gene regulatory elements that enabled the erstwhile plastidic gene to become functional in the nuclear genome were identified and the evolution of the intronic and exonic sequences in the nucleus is described. Relocation and truncation of the accD gene is a remarkable example of the processes underpinning endosymbiotic evolution.

Anomalous Fermion Mass Generation at Three Loops
We present a novel mechanism for generating gauge-invariant fermion masses through global anomalies at the three loop level. In a gauge theory, global anomalies are triggered by the possible existence of scalar or pseudoscalar states and heavy fermions, whose masses may not necessarily result from spontaneous symmetry breaking. The implications of this mass-generating mechanism for model building are discussed, including the possibility of creating low-scale fermion masses by quantum gravity effects.

[age, lymphoma, hl, incidence, year, nhl, male, old, rate, female]

Age incidence patterns of lymphomas in children and young adults in England, 1995-2008
Purpose: Lymphomas comprise 10% of tumours in children (ages 0 to 14) and 18% in young adults (ages 15 to 29) but only 4% in older adults. With the developments in diagnostic techniques and classification more extensive information is becoming available. This enables more closely targeted therapies and more detailed analyses of the incidence patterns of these tumours.
Methods: National cancer incidence data for England for individuals aged 0 to 29 were extracted from the national cancer dataset. Lymphomas were classified as Hodgkin (HL) and non-Hodgkin (NHL). Those with detailed morphological information were further subdivided into six classes for NHL and four for HL. Incidence rates were calculated per million person years at risk (PMY) and analysed using Poisson regression.
Results: There were 9693 lymphomas in 0 to 29 year olds in England from 1995 to 2008. The rates were 17 PMYin 0 to 14 year olds and 57 PMYin 15 to 29 year olds. There is a peak in NHL incidence at about age 5, mainly due to Burkitt lymphoma in males and lymphoblastic lymphoma in females. By age 20 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type in both males and females. Both diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular and nodular NHL have higher proportions of males in the 10–24 year old group than other age groups. HL has a peak in incidence at around 20, mainly due to nodular sclerosing HL, which has similar rates in males and females. For other types of HL the rate in males is greater than that in females. 
Conclusion: The difference in the age distributions for different subtypes of NHL and HL and age-variability in the sex ratio imply that the aetiologies vary by age and subtype.

Sero-diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis: attempts to determine antigen and antibody relevance to infection.
Attempt was made to define antigens and antisera which might prove useful in diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in man. A convalescent antiserum (serum from rabbits after liver infection with Aspergillus fumigatus conidia) which might be more representative of immunological reaction to fungal growth in vivo, did not react in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with commerical antigens which are used at present in attempts to detect antibody response in systemic infections in man. However, this convalescent antiserum reacted with antigens from a range of fungal extracts. Antigens from young culture filtrates in particular the 24th culture filtrate are advocated as the standard antigens for antibody detection using conventional immunoprecipitation techniques. For the detection of circulating antigens, the use of convalescent antiserum in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay might be promising in the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.

Students were interviewed multiple times at various junctures throughout their first academic year. Although they told stories of everyday disabling barriers, they also shared experiences of academic and social successes. The project was primarily focused on students with AS; however, its findings will hopefully help inform inclusive policy and practice within higher education institutions.

Population Genomics of the Wolbachia Endosymbiont in Drosophila melanogaster
Wolbachia are maternally inherited symbiotic bacteria, commonly found in arthropods, which are able to manipulate the reproduction of their host in order to maximise their transmission. The evolutionary history of endosymbionts like Wolbachia can be revealed by integrating information on infection status in natural populations with patterns of sequence variation in Wolbachia and host mitochondrial genomes. Here we use whole-genome resequencing data from 290 lines of Drosophila melanogaster from North America, Europe, and Africa to predict Wolbachia infection status, estimate relative cytoplasmic genome copy number, and reconstruct Wolbachia and mitochondrial genome sequences. Overall, 63% of Drosophila strains were predicted to be infected with Wolbachia by our in silico analysis pipeline, which shows 99% concordance with infection status determined by diagnostic PCR. Complete Wolbachia and mitochondrial genomes show congruent phylogenies, consistent with strict vertical transmission through the maternal cytoplasm and imperfect transmission of Wolbachia. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis reveals that the most recent common ancestor of all Wolbachia and mitochondrial genomes in D. melanogaster dates to around 8,000 years ago. We find evidence for a recent global replacement of ancestral Wolbachia and mtDNA lineages, but our data suggest that the derived wMel lineage arose several thousand years ago, not in the 20th century as previously proposed. Our data also provide evidence that this global replacement event is incomplete and is likely to be one of several similar incomplete replacement events that have occurred since the out-of-Africa migration that allowed D. melanogaster to colonize worldwide habitats. This study provides a complete genomic analysis of the evolutionary mode and temporal dynamics of the D. melanogaster-Wolbachia symbiosis, as well as important resources for further analyses of the impact of Wolbachia on host biology.

Occult cerebrovascular disease and late-onset epilepsy: could loss of neurovascular unit integrity be a viable model?
Late-onset epilepsy (LOE) first occurs after 60 years of age and may be due to occult cerebrovascular disease (CVD) which confers an increased risk of stroke. However, patients with late-onset epilepsy are not currently consistently investigated or treated for cerebrovascular risk factors. We discuss how abnormalities of neurovascular unit function, namely, changes in regional cerebral blood flow and blood brain barrier disruption, may be caused by occult cerebrovascular disease but present clinically as late-onset epilepsy. We describe novel magnetic resonance imaging methods to detect abnormal neurovascular unit function in subjects with LOE and controls. We hypothesise that occult CVD may cause LOE as a result of neurovascular unit dysfunction.

Longitudinal Change in Mammographic Density and Association with Breast Cancer Risk: a Case-Control Study
High mammographic breast density is associated with increased risk of breast cancer, but how risk varies with longitudinal change in density is less clear. To investigate, a case-control study of 30 women with screen-detected cancer and 30 women with a normal mammogram, all with two previous nor-mal mammograms, was conducted. Percentage density for all mammograms was estimated with the thresholding software Cumulus. Mean density at first screen was not significantly different in cases and controls in contralateral (36.5 vs. 32.6, p = 0.23) or ipsilateral (36.0 vs. 32.9 p = 0.37) breasts, but mean re-duction in density from first to third screen was significantly different in both contralateral (10.7 vs. 5.1, p = 0.02) and ipsilateral (11.7 vs. 6.2, p = 0.04) breasts. Using logistic regression, and controlling for age and HRT use, breast cancer risk was found to be associated with change in density from first to third screen.

[cancer, autophagy, microenvironment, cell, fibroblast, inflammatory, tumor, inflammation, key, production]

Cytokine production and inflammation drive autophagy in the tumor microenvironment: role of stromal caveolin-1 as a key regulator.
Recently, we proposed a new paradigm for understanding the role of the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer onset and progression. In this model, cancer cells induce oxidative stress in adjacent fibroblasts. This, in turn, results in the onset of stromal autophagy, which produces recycled nutrients to "feed" anabolic cancer cells. However, it remains unknown how autophagy in the tumor microenvironment relates to inflammation, another key driver of tumorigenesis. To address this issue, here we employed a well-characterized co-culture system in which cancer cells induce autophagy in adjacent fibroblasts via oxidative stress and NFκB-activation. We show, using this co-culture system, that the same experimental conditions that result in an autophagic microenvironment, also drive in the production of numerous inflammatory mediators (including IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, MIP1a, IFNg, RANTES (CCL5) and GMCSF). Furthermore, we demonstrate that most of these inflammatory mediators are individually sufficient to directly induce the onset of autophagy in fibroblasts. To further validate the in vivo relevance of these findings, we assessed the inflammatory status of Cav-1 (-/-) null mammary fat pads, which are a model of a bonafide autophagic microenvironment. Notably, we show that Cav-1 (-/-) mammary fat pads undergo infiltration with numerous inflammatory cell types, including lymphocytes, T-cells, macrophages and mast cells. Taken together, our results suggest that cytokine production and inflammation are key drivers of autophagy in the tumor microenvironment. These results may explain why a loss of stromal Cav-1 is a powerful predictor of poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients, as it is a marker of both (1) autophagy and (2) inflammation in the tumor microenvironment. Lastly, hypoxia in fibroblasts was not sufficient to induce the full-blown inflammatory response that we observed during the co-culture of fibroblasts with cancer cells, indicating that key reciprocal interactions between cancer cells and fibroblasts may be required.

[dopamine, hf, hair, human, agonist, effect]

Dopamine is a novel, direct inducer of catagen in human scalp hair follicles in vitro.
BACKGROUND: Although there are clinical reports of hair loss associated with levodopa and dopamine agonists, it is unclear whether dopamine exerts any direct effects on the human hair follicle (HF). OBJECTIVES: Given the widespread use of dopamine agonists and antagonists in clinical medicine, we sought to determine whether dopamine exerts direct effects on human HF growth and/or pigmentation in vitro, and whether human HFs express dopamine receptors (DRs). METHODS: Microdissected human scalp HFs from women were treated in serum-free organ culture for 7 days with dopamine (10-1000 nmol L ), and the effects on hair shaft production, HF cycling (i.e. anagen-catagen transition), hair matrix keratinocyte proliferation and apoptosis, and HF pigmentation were measured by quantitative (immuno-) histomorphometry. RESULTS: Dopamine had no consistent effect on hair shaft production, but did promote HF regression (catagen). It was also associated with significantly reduced proliferation of HF matrix keratinocytes (P < 0·01) and reduced intrafollicular melanin production. Dopamine receptor transcripts were identified in HFs and skin. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that dopamine is an inhibitor of human hair growth, via the promotion of catagen induction, at least in vitro. This may offer a rational explanation for the induction of telogen effluvium in some women treated with dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine. Moreover, dopaminergic agonists deserve further exploration as novel inhibitors of unwanted human hair growth (hirsutism, hypertrichosis).

Dietary energy density: A mediator of depressive symptoms and abdominal obesity or independent predictor of abdominal obesity?
Background: In the US, Europe, and throughout the world, abdominal obesity prevalence is increasing. Depressive symptoms may contribute to abdominal obesity through the consumption of diets high in energy density. Purpose: To test dietary energy density (DED; kilocalories/gram of food and beverages consumed) for an independent relationship with abdominal obesity or as a mediator between depressive symptoms and abdominal obesity. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 87 mid-life, overweight adults; 73.6% women; 50.6% African-American. Variables and measures: Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) to measure depressive symptoms; 3-day weighed food records to calculate DED; and waist circumference, an indicator of abdominal obesity. Hierarchical regression tested if DED explained waist circumference variance while controlling for depressive symptoms and consumed food and beverage weight. Three approaches tested DED as a mediator. Results: Nearly three-quarters of participants had abdominal obesity, and the mean waist circumference was 103.2 (SD 14.3) cm. Mean values: BDI-II was 8.67 (SD 8.34) which indicates that most participants experienced minimal depressive symptoms, and 21.8% reported mild to severe depressive symptoms (BDI-II ≥ 14); DED was 0.75 (SD 0.22) kilocalories/gram. Hierarchical regression showed an independent association between DED and waist circumference with DED explaining 7.0% of variance above that accounted for by BDI-II and food and beverage weight. DED did not mediate between depressive symptoms and abdominal obesity. Conclusions: Depressive symptoms and DED were associated with elevated waist circumference, thus a comprehensive intervention aimed at improving depressive symptoms and decreasing DED to reduce waist circumference is warranted.

[material, defect-tolerance, brittle, toughness, hierarchy]

Structural hierarchies define toughness and defect-tolerance despite simple and mechanically inferior brittle building blocks
Mineralized biological materials such as bone, sea sponges or diatoms provide load-bearing and armor functions and universally feature structural hierarchies from nano to macro. Here we report a systematic investigation of the effect of hierarchical structures on toughness and defect-tolerance based on a single and mechanically inferior brittle base material, silica, using a bottom-up approach rooted in atomistic modeling. Our analysis reveals drastic changes in the material crack-propagation resistance (R-curve) solely due to the introduction of hierarchical structures that also result in a vastly increased toughness and defect-tolerance, enabling stable crack propagation over an extensive range of crack sizes. Over a range of up to four hierarchy levels, we find an exponential increase in the defect-tolerance approaching hundred micrometers without introducing additional mechanisms or materials. This presents a significant departure from the defect-tolerance of the base material, silica, which is brittle and highly sensitive even to extremely small nanometer-scale defects.

[cav-1, stromal, cell, tumor, deficient, inflammation, mitochondrial, glycolysis, stress, oxidative]

Loss of stromal caveolin-1 leads to oxidative stress, mimics hypoxia and drives inflammation in the tumor microenvironment, conferring the "reverse Warburg effect": a transcriptional informatics analysis with validation.
Cav-1 (-/-) deficient stromal cells are a new genetic model for myofibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts. Using an unbiased informatics analysis of the transcriptional profile of Cav-1 (-/-) deficient mesenchymal stromal cells, we have now identified many of the major signaling pathways that are activated by a loss of Cav-1, under conditions of metabolic restriction (with low glucose media). Our informatics analysis suggests that a loss of Cav-1 induces oxidative stress, which mimics a constitutive pseudo-hypoxic state, leading to (1) aerobic glycolysis and (2) inflammation in the tumor stromal microenvironment. This occurs via the activation of two major transcription factors, namely HIF (aerobic glycolysis) and NFκB (inflammation) in Cav-1 (-/-) stromal fibroblastic cells. Experimentally, we show that Cav-1 deficient stromal cells may possess defective mitochondria, due to the over-production of nitric oxide (NO), resulting in the tyrosine nitration of the mitochondrial respiratory chain components (such as complex I). Elevated levels of nitro-tyrosine were observed both in Cav-1 (-/-) stromal cells, and via acute knock-down with siRNA targeting Cav-1. Finally, metabolic restriction with mitochondrial (complex I) and glycolysis inhibitors was synthetically lethal with a Cav-1 (-/-) deficiency in mice. As such, Cav-1 deficient mice show a dramatically reduced mitochondrial reserve capacity. Thus, a mitochondrial defect in Cav-1 deficient stromal cells could drive oxidative stress, leading to aerobic glycolysis, and inflammation, in the tumor microenvironment. These stromal alterations may underlie the molecular basis of the "reverse Warburg effect", and could provide the key to targeted anti-cancer therapies using metabolic inhibitors. In direct support of these findings, the transcriptional profile of Cav-1 (-/-) stromal cells overlaps significantly with Alzheimer disease, which is characterized by oxidative stress, NO over-production (peroxynitrite formation), inflammation, hypoxia and mitochondrial dysfunction. We conclude that Cav-1 (-/-) deficient mice are a new whole-body animal model for an activated lethal tumor microenvironment, i.e., "tumor stroma" without the tumor. Since Cav-1 (-/-) mice are also an established animal model for profibrotic disease, our current results may have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of scleroderma (systemic sclerosis) and pulmonary fibrosis, which are also related to abnormal mesenchymal stem cell function.

A hierachical configuration system for a massively parallel neural hardware platform
Simulation of large networks of neurons is a powerful and increasingly prominent methodology for investigate brain functions and structures. Dedicated parallel hardware is a natural candidate for simulating the dynamic activity of many non-linear units communicating asynchronously. It is only scientifically useful, however, if the simulation tools can be configured and run easily and quickly. We present a method to map network models to computational nodes on the SpiNNaker system, a programmable parallel neurally-inspired hardware architecture, by exploiting the hierarchies built in the model. This PArtitioning and Configuration MANager (PACMAN) system supports arbitrary network topologies and arbitrary membrane potential and synapse dynamics, and (most importantly) decouples the model from the device, allowing a variety of languages (PyNN, Nengo, etc.) to drive the simulation hardware. Model representation operates on a Population/Projection level rather than a single-neuron and connection level, exploiting hierarchical properties to lower the complexity of allocating resources and mapping the model onto the system. PACMAN can be thus be used to generate structures coming from different models and front-ends, either with a host-based process, or by parallelising it on the SpiNNaker machine itself to speed up the generation process greatly. We describe the approach with a first implementation of the framework used to configure the current generation of SpiNNaker machines and present results from a set of key benchmarks. The system allows researchers to exploit dedicated simulation hardware which may otherwise be difficult to program. In effect, PACMAN provides automated hardware acceleration for some commonly used network simulators while also pointing towards the advantages of hierarchical configuration for large, domain-specific hardware systems.

Novel type II anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (GA101) evokes homotypic adhesion and actin-dependent, lysosome-mediated cell death in B-cell malignancies.
The anti-CD20 mAb rituximab has substantially improved the clinical outcome of patients with a wide range of B-cell malignancies. However, many patients relapse or fail to respond to rituximab, and thus there is intense investigation into the development of novel anti-CD20 mAbs with improved therapeutic efficacy. Although Fc-FcγR interactions appear to underlie much of the therapeutic success with rituximab, certain type II anti-CD20 mAbs efficiently induce programmed cell death (PCD), whereas rituximab-like type I anti-CD20 mAbs do not. Here, we show that the humanized, glycoengineered anti-CD20 mAb GA101 and derivatives harboring non-glycoengineered Fc regions are type II mAb that trigger nonapoptotic PCD in a range of B-lymphoma cell lines and primary B-cell malignancies. We demonstrate that GA101-induced cell death is dependent on actin reorganization, can be abrogated by inhibitors of actin polymerization, and is independent of BCL-2 overexpression and caspase activation. GA101-induced PCD is executed by lysosomes which disperse their contents into the cytoplasm and surrounding environment. Taken together, these findings reveal that GA101 is able to potently elicit actin-dependent, lysosomal cell death, which may potentially lead to improved clearance of B-cell malignancies in vivo.

Spectroscopy in the analysis of bacterial and eukaryotic cell footprints on implant surfaces.
We tested the suitability of two spectroscopic methods, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), in the recognition of bacterial and eukaryotic cell footprints on implant surfaces. Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and Staphylococcus aureus were cultured on sample surfaces and detached using trypsin. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed that the processed surfaces did not contain any human or microbial cells. The footprints were then analysed using XPS and ToF-SIMS. XPS results showed no significant differences between the footprints, but principal component analysis of the ToF-SIMS data enabled clear separation of MSC-footprints from the S. aureus and co-culture footprints (p < 0.03). ToF-SIMS also demonstrated 'race for the surface' between proteins, which suggest surface charge (zeta-potential) dependent protein adsorption. ToF-SIMS differentiated eukaryotic and bacterial footprints and has potential for post-hoc detection of implant-related infections based on the typical ToF-SIMS spectra.

Economic evaluation of a randomized controlled trial of ultrasound therapy for hard-to-heal venous leg ulcers.
BACKGROUND: A pragmatic, multicentre randomized controlled trial (VenUS III) was conducted to determine whether low-dose ultrasound therapy increased the healing rate of hard-to-heal leg ulcers. This study was a cost-effectiveness analysis of the trial data. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses were conducted alongside the VenUS III trial, in which patients were randomly allocated to either ultrasound treatment administered weekly for 12 weeks along with standard care, or standard care alone. The time horizon was 12 months and based on the UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. RESULTS: The base-case analysis showed that ultrasound therapy added to standard care was likely to be more costly and provide no extra benefit over standard care alone. Individuals who received ultrasound treatment plus standard care took a mean of 14.7 (95 per cent confidence interval - 32.7 to 56.8) days longer to heal, had 0.009 (-0.042 to 0.024) fewer quality-adjusted life years and had higher treatment costs by £ 197.88 (-35.19 to 420.32). Based on these point estimates, ultrasound therapy plus standard care for leg ulcers was dominated by standard care alone. The analysis of uncertainty showed that this treatment strategy is unlikely to be cost-effective. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound treatment was not cost-effective for hard-to-heal leg ulcers and should not be recommended for adoption in the NHS.

Lichen planopilaris following hair transplantation and face-lift surgery.
Cosmetic surgical procedures, including hair transplantation and face-lift surgery, are becoming increasingly popular. However, there is very little information regarding the associated development of dermatological conditions following these procedures. Lichen planopilaris (LPP) is an uncommon inflammatory hair disorder of unknown aetiology that results in permanent alopecia and replacement of hair follicles with scar-like fibrous tissue. Frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA), a variant of LPP, involves the frontal hairline and shares similar histological findings with those of LPP. We report 10 patients who developed LPP/FFA following cosmetic scalp surgery. Seven patients developed LPP following hair transplantation, and three patients developed FFA following face-lift surgery. In all cases there was no previous history of LPP or FFA. There is currently a lack of evidence to link the procedures of hair transplantation and cosmetic face-lift surgery to LPP and FFA, respectively. This is the first case series to describe this connection and to postulate the possible pathological processes underlying the clinical observation. Explanations include Koebner phenomenon induced by surgical trauma, an autoimmune process targeting an (as yet, unknown) hair follicle antigen liberated during surgery or perhaps a postsurgery proinflammatory milieu inducing hair follicle immune privilege collapse and follicular damage in susceptible individuals.

Degenerate Human Nucleus Pulposus Cells Promote Neurite Outgrowth in Neural Cells
Innervation of nociceptive nerve fibres into the normally aneural nucleus pulposus (NP) of the intervertebral disc (IVD) occurs during degeneration resulting in discogenic back pain. The neurotrophins nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which are associated with stimulation of axonal outgrowth and nociception by neuronal cells, are both expressed by NP cells, with BDNF levels increasing with disease severity. However the mechanism of interaction between human NP cells and neural cells has yet to be fully elucidated. Therefore the aim of this study was to determine whether non-degenerate or degenerate human NP cells inhibit or stimulate neural outgrowth and whether any outgrowth is mediated by NGF or BDNF. Human NP cells from non-degenerate and degenerate IVD were cultured in alginate beads then co-cultured for 48 hours with human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Co-culture of non-degenerate NP cells with neural cells resulted in both an inhibition of neurite outgrowth and reduction in percentage of neurite expressing cells. Conversely co-culture with degenerate NP cells resulted in an increase in both neurite length and percentage of neurite expressing cells. Addition of anti-NGF to the co-culture with degenerate cells resulted in a decrease in percentage of neurite expressing cells, while addition of anti-BDNF resulted in a decrease in both neurite length and percentage of neurite expressing cells. Our findings show that while non-degenerate NP cells are capable of inhibiting neurite outgrowth from human neural cells, degenerate NP cells stimulate outgrowth. Neurotrophin blocking studies demonstrated that both NGF and BDNF, secreted by degenerate NP cells, may play a role in this stimulation with BDNF potentially playing the predominant role. These findings suggest that NP cells are capable of regulating nerve ingrowth and that neoinnervation occurring during IVD degeneration may be stimulated by the NP cells themselves.

First Beam Spectra of SC Third Harmonic Cavity at FLASH
Third harmonic superconducting cavities have been designed and fabricated by FNAL to minimise the energy spread along bunches in the FLASH facility at DESY. A module, consisting of four nine-cell 3.9 GHz cavities, has been installed in FLASH. The first measurement with beam excitation is presented, and the comparisons to transmission measurement without beam and simulations are made. Higher order modes (HOMs) are able to propagate to adjacent cavities through attached beam tubes. Modes from 1.3 GHz cavities in the module nearby also propagate into this module.

Self-reported taste and smell changes during cancer chemotherapy.
PurposeThis study explores the prevalence of self-reported taste and smell changes (TSCs) during chemotherapy and relationships between TSCs and demographic and clinical factors.Materials and methodsConsecutive patients who had received chemotherapy for ≥6 weeks at 11 outpatient chemotherapy units completed a questionnaire developed for this survey.ResultsSeventy-five percent of the 518 participants reported TSCs, with TSCs more prevalent among women and younger patients. After adjustment for age and sex, we found that patients reporting TSCs more often reported: previous smell changes, less responsibility for cooking, concurrent medication, higher educational levels, and being on sick leave. Participants reporting oral problems, nausea, appetite loss, and depressed mood more frequently reported TSCs. Diagnosis and type of chemotherapy regimen did not predict TSCs.ConclusionTSCs were found to be common during cancer chemotherapy and were related to sociodemographic rather than clinical factors. TSCs were also found to be closely related to many other side effects of chemotherapy.

Immunohistological pointers to a possible role for excessive cathelicidin (LL-37) expression by apocrine sweat glands in the pathogenesis of hidradenitis suppurativa/acne inversa.
BACKGROUND:   The cause of follicular occlusion, a key early event in the pathogenesis of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), also known as acne inversa, remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: To identify changes, if any, in the antimicrobial peptide (AMP) and cytokine expression profile of HS affected human skin. METHODS: Quantitative immunohistomorphometry was used to compare the in situ protein expression of selected AMPs and cytokines in lesional HS skin from 18 patients with that in healthy skin (n = 12). The lesional skin from patients with HS was histologically subclassified based on the predominance of inflammation vs. scarring. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, significantly increased immunoreactivity for cathelicidin (LL-37) was noted in the apocrine sweat gland and distal outer root sheath (ORS) of the hair follicle (HF) epithelium in lesional HS skin. Immunoreactivity for LL-37, psoriasin, human β-defensin 3 (hBD3), α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-8 was significantly increased in HS epidermis. LL-37 and TNF-α immunoreactivity was also increased in the dermis of lesional HS skin. In contrast, lysozyme expression was decreased in the epidermis of lesional HS skin, while that of TNF-α and IL-8 was decreased in the proximal ORS of HFs in HS lesions. These differences were most pronounced in HS with predominant inflammation. CONCLUSIONS:   Our observations raise the question as to whether excessive secretion of AMPs by the skin, in particular by the apocrine sweat glands, distal HF epithelium, and epidermis, may attract inflammation and thus facilitate or promote HS development.

Chemical consequences of cutaneous photoageing
Human skin, in common with other organs, ages as a consequence of the passage of time, but in areas exposed to solar ultraviolet radiation, the effects of this intrinsic ageing process are exacerbated. In particular, both the severity and speed of onset of age-related changes, such as wrinkle formation and loss of elasticity, are enhanced in photoaged (also termed extrinsically aged) as compared with aged, photoprotected, skin. The anatomy of skin is characterised by two major layers: an outer, avascular, yet highly cellular and dynamic epidermis and an underlying vascularised, comparatively static and cell-poor, dermis. The structural consequences of photoageing are mainly evident in the extracellular matrix-rich but cell-poor dermis where key extracellular matrix proteins are particularly susceptible to photodamage. Most investigations to date have concentrated on the cell as both a target for and mediator of, ultraviolet radiation-induced photoageing. As the main effectors of dermal remodelling produced by cells (extracellular proteases) generally have low substrate specificity, we recently suggested that the differential susceptibility of key extracellular matrix proteins to the processes of photoageing may be due to direct, as opposed to cell-mediated, photodamage. In this review, we discuss the experimental evidence for ultraviolet radiation (and related reactive oxygen species)mediated differential degradation of normally long lived dermal proteins including the fibrillar collagens, elastic fibre components, glycoproteins and proteoglycans. Whilst these components exhibit highly diverse primary and hence macro-and supra-molecular structures, we present evidence that amino acid composition alone may be a useful predictor of age-related protein degradation in both photoexposed and, as a consequence of differential oxidation sensitivity, photoprotected, tissues.

Visualization and characterisation of defined hair follicle compartments by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) imaging without labelling.
BACKGROUND: To visualise and characterise skin architecture, the tissue usually has to be destroyed and labelled. OBJECTIVES: The use of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy as a label-free, minimally sample destructive method to define hair follicular structure has been explored and demonstrated in this paper. METHODS: Human scalp skin cryosections were imaged using FTIR microscopy and the data was subsequently analysed with N-FINDR spectral unmixing algorithm. RESULTS: This resulted in an excellent distinction of known hair follicle tissue layers, which could be discerned based on their molecular structure. CONCLUSION: The development of a minimally sample-destructive, label-free spectroscopy based technique that can differentiate layers of cells in the dermal papilla and connective tissue sheath in the mesenchyme of the hair follicle paves the way forward to identifying spectral markers important in wound healing and stem cell therapies.

The detectability of habitable exomoons with Kepler
Over 750 extrasolar planets have been discovered, but none of them have detected moons around them. From recent studies, the applications of transit exoplanet detection techniques called Transit Timing Variation (TTV) and Transit Timing Duration (TDV) have been proposed to use for exomoon detection. Furthermore, from the success of the Kepler mission, the number of transiting exoplanets has increased rapidly. Therefore, investigating the detectability of exomoons via TTV and TDV with the Kepler mission is timely. In this dissertation, the detectability of a habitable-zone exomoon orbiting around a giant planet in M-Dwarf system is investigated. Light curves of 146,410 systems with various conﬁgurations were simulated around M-Dwarf hosts of mass 0.5 Msun and radius 0.55 Rsun. Jupiter-like giant planets which oﬀer the best potential for hosting habitable exomoons were considered with rocky Earth-mass moons. The detectability is measured by using the phase-correlation between TTV and TDV signals. The Kepler photometric noise is all accounted for in the analysis in order to ﬁnd the exomoon detectability. From simulation results, super-Earth-size habitable exomoons in M-Dwarf systems may be detectable with Kepler. The detectability depends on the intensity of the TDV signal more than the TTV signal. High-mass moons orbiting low-mass planets should be the best candidates for detection. However, under certain conditions, aliasing in between the planet period and the moon period may prevent exomoon detection, due to incomplete moon phase information.

Dentists variation in the determination of orthodontic treatment need.
The criteria that dentists use to judge the need for orthodontic treatment are not clear. This study investigates variation in dentists' perception of orthodontic treatment need. Seventy-four dentists were asked to assess 320 dental casts in relation to aesthetic and dental health need. The results of this investigation revealed that the panel was divided as what constituted a need for orthodontic treatment on dental health grounds. It is suggested that one method of achieving a more uniform evaluation of orthodontic treatment need is the use of an occlusal index. Until an occlusal index is accepted and used by the profession, the distortion of need and demand for orthodontic treatment by dentists' unequal perceptions will continue.

Extensive self-harm scarring: successful treatment with simultaneous use of a single layer skin substitute and split-thickness skin graft.
Objective: Deliberate self-harm resulting in extensive skin scarring is a difficult clinical problem and is commonly associated with physical and sexual abuse or a known history of mental illness. Immediate hospital attendance often addresses the acute wound and current psychological state of patients; however, ongoing regret of these resulting scars present a problem to the patient and clinician. Deliberate self-harm to the skin leaves permanent and socially unacceptable scars in anatomically conspicuous areas and recognizable to others. Therefore, the aim was to offer a treatment to change these scars to that of an unknown entity. Methods: Six patients with extensive linear scars covering most of the forearm received surgical reconstruction. Patients were female aged between 18 and 47 years. Each patient had a history of psychosocial problems, and each had undergone psychiatric treatment. After an in-depth consultation and a further clinical psychological assessment, each individual was deemed suitable for reconstructive surgery. Scars were excised from the forearm en block, removing the majority of the affected area. Simultaneous use of a single layer skin substitute was used, covered by an autologous split-thickness skin graft. Negative pressure wound therapy was then applied immediately for 2 weeks after surgery. Results: The original scars were successfully converted to a socially and cosmetically acceptable appearance. Postoperative infection due to negative pressure wound therapy failure in one patient was the only complication reported. Conclusions: This case series highlights the utility of an innovative treatment for patients with DSH scarring resulting in aesthetic, psychological, and functional benefits.

Ecologies of participation in school classrooms
The concept of legitimate peripheral participation was developed by considering informal learning contexts. However, its applicability to school classrooms is problematic. This is particularly so when teacher centred and decontextualised procedural practices predominate as they do in usual school mathematics classrooms. Different meanings of participation in community of practice theory are identified. The applicability of legitimate peripheral participation to school mathematics classrooms is critiqued by considering: the nature of social practice, learning relationships, power, agency, and identity. Different forms of participation in school mathematics are discussed and the concept of ecologies of participation is proposed as a means to understand the complexity and multidimensionality of participation in both formal and informal learning contexts.

Optical Filters Utilizing Ion Implanted Bragg Gratings in SOI Waveguides
<p>The refractive index modulation associated with the implantation of oxygen or silicon into waveguides formed in silicon-on-insulator (SOI) has been investigated to determine the feasibility of producing planar, implantation induced Bragg grating optical filters. A two-dimensional coupled mode theory-based simulation suggests that relatively short grating lengths, on the order of a thousand microns, can exhibit sufficient wavelength suppression, of &gt;10 dB, using the implantation technique. Fabricated planar implanted slab-guided SOI waveguides demonstrated an extinction of −10 dB for TE modes and −6 dB for TM modes for the case of oxygen implantation. Extinctions of −5 dB and −2 dB have been demonstrated with silicon implantation.</p>

Pro-arrhythmogenic effects of the S140G KCNQ1 mutation in human atrial fibrillation - insights from modelling.
Key points  A previous study has identified a gene mutation (KCNQ1 S140G) in some patients with a familial form of atrial fibrillation, one of the most common cardiac rhythm disturbances causing morbidity and mortality. A causal link between the mutation and genesis of atrial fibrillation has not yet been directly demonstrated.  Increased I(Ks) arising from the KCNQ1 S140G mutation abbreviated atrial action potential duration (APD) and effective refractory period (ERP) and flattened APD and ERP restitution curves. It reduced atrial conduction velocity at low excitation rates, but increased it at high excitation rates that facilitated the conduction of high rate atrial excitation waves.  The mutation increased tissue susceptibility for initiation and maintenance of atrial arrhythmias.  The mutation stabilizes and accelerates re-entrant excitation waves, leading to rapid and sustained re-entry.  This study provides novel insights towards understanding the mechanisms underlying the pro-arrhythmic effects of the KCNQ1 S140G mutation.

Early events in the invasion of the human nail plate by Trichophyton mentagrophytes.
A new in vitro model for the study of nail invasion by dermatophyte fungi was developed. The dermatophyte Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and fragments of finger-nails and toe-nails were used. Arthroconidia were inoculated on the ventral surface of the nails. After 6 h, adherence and germination of arthroconidia was observed. By 16 h, small germ tubes with side branches were evident. At about 24 h, micro-colonies had become established. At 48 h, a mycelium had formed, and at about 72 h most of the nail fragment was covered with fungal growth. Nail penetration occurred from the ventral surface through the intercellular spaces, and with longer incubation all three layers were invaded by arthroconidia growing through channels. Nail invasion occurred in the absence of added nutrients. Dermatophyte fungi appeared to invade the nail by a combination of mechanical and chemical factors. The model provides a substrate to study the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of new antifungal agents in situ.

Biomarker indicators for anaerobic oxidizers of methane in brackish-marine sediments with diffusive methane fluxes
The anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is a major methane sink in marine sediments and plays a crucial role in mitigating methane fluxes to the overlying water column. We investigated biomarker distributions and compound specific isotopic signatures in sediments from sites on the Northern European continental margin that are characterized by a diffusive flux of methane At all sites, the organic matter (OM) is predominantly derived from terrestrial higher plants, with subordinate abundances of algal biomarkers, but biomarkers for archaea and bacteria are also present. The co-occurrence of the archaeal lipids archaeol, sn-2-hydroxyarchaeol and 2,6,10,15,19-pentamethylicosane (PMI) with non-isoprenoidal glycerol diethers inferred to derive from sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) is similar to microbial biomarker assemblages observed at cold seeps. The archaeal and inferred SRB biomarker concentrations typically reach maxima close to the sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ), where archaeal biomarkers are depleted in C-13 The 16S rRNA gene sequences from the SMTZ of the Aarhus Bay sediment core indicate the occurrence of ANME-1 archaea, consistent with inferences derived from biomarker distributions The observations suggest that AOM in these diffusive settings is mediated by consortia of archaea and bacteria similar to those found at many seep and methane hydrate sites around the world.

A validation of cognitive biomarkers for the early identification of cognitive enhancing agents in schizotypy: a three-center double-blind placebo-controlled study.
A number of compounds aimed at improving cognition in schizophrenia have failed to demonstrate efficacy in Phase 2 clinical trials. Translational studies using biomarkers in surrogate populations, such as schizotypy, could be used to assess the efficacy of novel compounds. In this study, we aimed to validate the sensitivity and inter-site reliability of cognitive biomarkers (working memory (N-back), spatial working memory (SWM) and verbal fluency (VF) tasks) to detect the schizotypy phenotype and its reversal by psychotropic drugs. Healthy volunteers scoring high or average on a schizotypal personality measure (122 in each group) were randomized to receive a single dose of risperidone, amisulpride, nicotine or placebo in a double-blind, between-subject design. We found evidence for a poorer performance on N-back and VF tasks in the high schizotypy group, replicating previous research. This effect was counteracted by amisulpride on N-back: it improved working memory in high schizotypy group but impaired the controls. A similar pattern was seen in SWM and VF. We interpret this finding in the light of the dopamine enhancing action of amisulpride when given in low doses. In contrast, risperidone impaired both groups and nicotine had a beneficial effect for the low baseline performers only. These effects were consistent across sites. These data demonstrates the utility of biomarkers in detecting the effect of schizotypy and its reversal by drugs that enhance dopamine and cholinergic function. Studies using similar design could help the early assessment of potential of compounds designed to improve cognition in schizophrenia.

[tumor, fibroblast, growth, autophagy, cancer, senescence, metastasis, human, cell]

Autophagy and senescence in cancer-associated fibroblasts metabolically supports tumor growth and metastasis via glycolysis and ketone production.
Senescent fibroblasts are known to promote tumor growth. However, the exact mechanism remains largely unknown. An important clue comes from recent studies linking autophagy with the onset of senescence. Thus, autophagy and senescence may be part of the same physiological process, known as the autophagy-senescence transition (AST). To test this hypothesis, human fibroblasts immortalized with telomerase (hTERT-BJ1) were stably transfected with autophagy genes (BNIP3, CTSB or ATG16L1). Their overexpression was sufficient to induce a constitutive autophagic phenotype, with features of mitophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction and a shift toward aerobic glycolysis, resulting in L-lactate and ketone body production. Autophagic fibroblasts also showed features of senescence, with increased p21(WAF1/CIP1), a CDK inhibitor, cellular hypertrophy and increased β-galactosidase activity. Thus, we genetically validated the existence of the autophagy-senescence transition. Importantly, autophagic-senescent fibroblasts promoted tumor growth and metastasis, when co-injected with human breast cancer cells, independently of angiogenesis. Autophagic-senescent fibroblasts stimulated mitochondrial metabolism in adjacent cancer cells, when the two cell types were co-cultured, as visualized by MitoTracker staining. In particular, autophagic ATG16L1 fibroblasts, which produced large amounts of ketone bodies (3-hydroxy-butyrate), had the strongest effects and promoted metastasis by up to 11-fold. Conversely, expression of ATG16L1 in epithelial cancer cells inhibited tumor growth, indicating that the effects of autophagy are compartment-specific. Thus, autophagic-senescent fibroblasts metabolically promote tumor growth and metastasis, by paracrine production of high-energy mitochondrial fuels. Our current studies provide genetic support for the importance of "two-compartment tumor metabolism" in driving tumor growth and metastasis via a simple energy transfer mechanism. Finally, β-galactosidase, a known lysosomal enzyme and biomarker of senescence, was localized to the tumor stroma in human breast cancer tissues, providing in vivo support for our hypothesis. Bioinformatic analysis of genome-wide transcriptional profiles from tumor stroma, isolated from human breast cancers, also validated the onset of an autophagy-senescence transition. Taken together, these studies establish a new functional link between host aging, autophagy, the tumor microenvironment and cancer metabolism.

Proteomic analysis of integrin-associated complexes from stem cells
The niche in which stem cells reside is involved in the regulation of stem cell fate, such as differentiation and self-renewal, by providing ECM proteins, growth factors, cell-cell interactions and balancing chemical factors such as the level of oxygen and pH. ECM proteins are involved in maintaining stemness of stem cells and in regulating differentiation via integrin-mediated signalling. Following the interaction of ECM proteins with integrins, integrins cluster and interact with large complexes of signalling proteins. These adhesion complexes have been reported to contain at least 150 proteins, which have been termed the adhesome. Adhesion complex proteins interact with the actin cytoskeleton and signalling pathways to play an essential role in stem cell fate. The hypothesis in this study was that the interaction of stem cells via integrin receptors with ECM proteins, lead to changes in the abundance or composition of adhesion complexes, which potentially activates signalling pathways involved in either maintaining or differentiation of stem cells.In this study, three principal advances have been made:First, a method was developed using ligand-coated magnetic beads for the isolation of integrin-associated complexes from pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The isolated integrin-associated complexes from hESCs were analysed by proteomic methods, which led to the detection of key integrin-associated adhesion proteins such as talin, vinculin, alpha actinin 4, filamin B, filamin C and zyxin. Second, isolation of integrin-associated complexes from multipotent MSCs was performed using a method based on “de-roofing” MSCs from FN or PDL coated plastic dishes, leading to the detection of key adhesome components by mass spectrometry. Ontological analysis of proteins enriched on FN demonstrated the enrichment of adhesion complexes. Third, following the induction of multipotent MSCs into early adipogenic MSCs and the isolation of integrin-associated complexes from early adipogenic MSCs and undifferentiated MSCs, core adhesome components were identified in induced and non-induced MSCs, with induction hypothesised to cause putative changes in the FN-induced adhesome network. Also, the level of adhesion complexes increased significantly in MSCs on FN upon induction into adipocytes compared to non-induced MSCs on FN and versus the control as shown by bioinformatics analysis. This data led to the hypothesis that upon induction of MSCs into adipocytes the abundance of proteins in integrin-associated complexes or the number of adhesion complexes increases.In conclusion, in this study two biochemical affinity methods were developed for the isolation of integrin-associated complexes from hESCs and MSCs, using ligand coated magnetic beads and ligand-coated plastic dishes. The development of these methods led to the isolation of adhesion-related proteins from pluripotent hESCs and differentiated MSCs and the detection of a pattern of changes in the abundance of adhesion related proteins in differentiated MSCs incubated on FN. The development of methods for the isolation of adhesion related complexes from stem cells can lead to a better understanding of the role of adhesion in differentiation and maintenance of pluripotency in stem cells. A better understanding of adhesion could have future implications in obtaining pure populations of undifferentiated stem cells for cell-based therapies and differentiated cells for the use in tissue engineering and repair.

[peptide, heavy, complex, beta2m, chain, ternary, binding]

An allosteric mechanism controls antigen presentation by the H-2K(b) complex.
The mechanism of assembly/dissociation of a recombinant water-soluble class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) H-2Kb molecule was studied by a real-time fluorescence resonance energy transfer method. Like the H-2Kd ternary complex Gakamsky et al. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 14841-14848, the interactions among the heavy chain, beta2-microglobulin (beta2m), and antigenic peptides were found to be controlled by an allosteric mechanism. Association of the heavy chain with beta2m increased peptide binding rate constants by more than 2 orders of magnitude and enhanced affinity of the heavy-chain molecule for peptides. Interaction of peptides with the heavy-chain binding site, in turn, increased markedly the affinity of the heavy chain for beta2m. Binding of peptide variants of the ovalbumin sequence (257-264) to the heavy chain/beta2m heterodimer was found to be a biphasic reaction. The fast phase was a second-order process with nearly the same rate constants as those of binding of peptides derived from the influenza virus nucleoprotein 147-155 to the H-2Kd heavy chain/beta2m heterodimer (3.0 +/- 1.0) x 10(-6) M-1 s-1 at 37 degrees C. The slow phase was a result of both the ternary complex assembly from the "free" heavy chain, beta2m, and peptide as well as an intramolecular conformational transition within the heavy chain/beta2m heterodimer to a peptide binding conformation. Biexponential kinetics of peptide or beta2m dissociation from the ternary complex were observed. They suggest that it can exist in two conformations. The rate constants of beta2m dissociation from the H-2Kb ternary complex were, in the limits of experimental accuracy, independent of the structure of the bound peptide, though their affinities differed by an order of magnitude. Dissociation of peptides from the Kb heavy chain was always faster than from the ternary complexes, yet the heavy chain/peptide complexes were considerably more stable compared with their Kd/nucleoprotein peptide counterparts.

A ring artifact suppression algorithm based on a priori information
In this letter, ring artifacts in two-dimensional (2D) tomographic slices are considered. For a parallel beam geometry we propose an interactive algorithm, which removes the artifacts while preserving fine image details. The algorithm comprises two stages and is based on a priori information about the true attenuation coefficient in some areas of a 2D slice. Even in the absence of any a priori information the initial stage of the algorithm can already provide good ring artifact suppression.

An investigation of visual field test parameters in glaucoma, patterns of visual field loss in diabetics and multispectral imaging of the optic nerve head in glaucoma
AbstractVisual field tests are routinely used for the detection and management of glaucoma. This thesis focuses on monitoring the vigilance during perimetry with pupil dynamics (pupillary movements, blinks) in glaucoma patients and the performance of using subsets of standard test patterns at detecting glaucomatous field loss. It describes the spatial pattern of visual field changes in diabetic retinopathy patients after treatment and the usage of multispectral imaging of the optic nerve head in glaucoma patients.The first investigation evaluated the use of pupillary parameters (pupil size and amplitude of pupillary oscillations) to monitor vigilance during perimetry in comparison to electroencephalography. A significant correlation was observed between the decreased pupil size and increased slow brain activities (theta and alpha). The inter-test threshold variability correlated with the pupil miosis.Another investigation explored blinks during a perimetric test and their relationship to the variability of threshold sensitivity in glaucoma patients. A wide range of blink frequencies was observed in glaucoma patients during perimetry and the timing of blinks was correlated with the stimuli presentations when they were supra-threshold. No significant relationship was observed between the threshold sensitivity variability and blink parameters (frequency, duration and microsleep numbers).The third investigation evaluated the use of subset of the 24-2 visual field test pattern at detecting glaucomatous field loss. A high sensitivity and specificity was observed when using subsets of the 24-2 pattern and test locations optimized by the positive predictive values showed a better performance than the test locations in random sequences.With the usage of a self-organized mapping method, nine spatial patterns of visual field loss in untreated diabetic retinopathy patients were classified. After laser treatment, a significant improvement on the spatial patterns of field loss and global indices was found.In the multispectral imaging study, the haemoglobin dependent differential light absorption (DLA) properties of the glaucomatous optic nerve head was evaluated with multispectral imaging. Change of DLA after medical hypotensive treatment was graded by five experts and no difference was observed in most of the patients.

[trypanosome, silicon, model]

The silicon trypanosome
African trypanosomes have emerged as promising unicellular model organisms for the next generation of systems biology. They offer unique advantages, due to their relative simplicity, the availability of all standard genomics techniques and a long history of quantitative research. Reproducible cultivation methods exist for morphologically and physiologically distinct life-cycle stages. The genome has been sequenced, and microarrays, RNA-interference and high-accuracy metabolomics are available. Furthermore, the availability of extensive kinetic data on all glycolytic enzymes has led to the early development of a complete, experiment-based dynamic model of an important biochemical pathway. Here we describe the achievements of trypanosome systems biology so far and outline the necessary steps towards the ambitious aim of creating a Silicon Trypanosome, a comprehensive, experiment-based, multi-scale mathematical model of trypanosome physiology. We expect that, in the long run, the quantitative modelling enabled by the Silicon Trypanosome will play a key role in selecting the most suitable targets for developing new anti-parasite drugs.

Development and application of the mollusc Arctica islandica as a paleoceanographic tool for the North Atlantic ocean
Until now there has been no tool comparable to corals for reconstructing long term high-resolution
geochemical time-series for the colder, higher-latitude oceans. In this thesis, the
long-lived(+ 100 years) boreal mollusc (Bivalvia) Arctica islandica is shown to be practical
for this purpose in the northern North Atlantic Ocean. The evidence, compiled here,
demonstrates that the carbonate shell of this species faithfully records the ambient dissolved
inorganic carbon's (DIC) radiocarbon (Δ14C) concentration and accurately reflects the
ambient temperature in its stable oxygen isotope (δ180) composition. However, the stable
carbon isotope (δ13C) composition of the A. islandica shell likely is not a good recorder of
ambient DIC δl3C, and likely responds to physiological controls. Four Δ14C time histories
are reconstructed from the annual bands of A. islandica shells for the higher-latitudes of the
northern North Atlantic Ocean (from 41°N to 70°N). These ocean records show significant
spatial and temporal differences in the evolution of the radiocarbon signal between the
subpolar and subtropical regions and between eastern and western regions of the northern
North Atlantic, which are attributed to regional differences in mixed-layer depth and the
presence of deepwater sources. A 109-year interannual record of bottom temperatures for a
location near the former Nantucket Lightship position has been reconstructed for the period
1875-1983 from the overlapped stable oxygen isotope composition of four A. islandica
shells. This record's annual temperature anomalies (variation from the running ten-year
mean) show significant positive correlation with regional bottom, sea surface and air
temperature anomalies. However, the shell-derived bottom temperature record describes a
century-long cooling (~1°C) in contrast to a century-long warming of regional sea surface
temperatures of equal magnitude, indicating a long term divergence between surface and bottom conditions. It is suggested that this contrast may be owed to a reduction in vertical
mixing and increased seasonal stratification of shelf waters. This thesis fulfills the
prophesy laid out nearly two decades ago by Thompson and Jones 1977 that Arctica
islandica could someday be used to reconstruct past ocean history as "the tree of the North
Atlantic".Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology September 1995Funding was partly provided by an ORAU Global Climate Change Fellowship

[oesophageal, sumatriptan, mmhg, motility]

Altered oesophageal motility following the administration of the 5-HT1 agonist, sumatriptan.
BACKGROUND: The 5-HT1 agonist sumatriptan, used in the treatment of migraine, can cause chest pain. AIM: To investigate the effect of a therapeutic dose of sumatriptan (6 mg s.c.) on oesophageal motility. METHODS: In 16 normal healthy subjects aged 19-32 years (9 males), the manometric response of the lower oesophageal sphincter (sleeve sensor), oesophageal body (four sites), stomach and pharynx (to register swallows) to 5 mL water swallows was assessed before and after a subcutaneous injection of either sumatriptan (6 mg) or saline control. Symptoms and ECGs were also monitored. RESULTS: Sumatriptan 6 mg s.c. altered oesophageal motility in all subjects. This was reflected by a significant increase in the amplitude of oesophageal body contractions (change from pre- to 1 h post-injection: sumatriptan 9.9 (2.8, 17.1) mmHg vs. placebo -0.8 (-4.2, 2.6) mmHg, difference 10.8 (4.4, 17.1) mmHg; P=0.003) and a transient increase in lower oesophageal sphincter pressure (change from pre- to 5 min post-injection: sumatriptan 10.9 (5.2, 16.6) mmHg vs. placebo 5.1 (1.8, 8.4) mmHg, difference 5.8 (-0.7, 12.3) mmHg; P=0.08). Sumatriptan had no effect on the velocity of propagation of oesophageal contractions (change from pre- to 1 h post-injection: sumatriptan -0.1 (-0.3, 0.1) cm/s vs. placebo -0.1 (-0.3, 0.0) cm/s, difference 0.1 (-0.1, 0.2) cm/s; P = 0.40). One subject experienced chest symptoms following sumatriptan and, although motility was altered, this did not reach pathological levels. No ECG abnormalities were observed. CONCLUSION: Sumatriptan (6 mg s.c.) significantly alters oesophageal motor function without affecting the ECG. It is therefore possible that sumatriptan-induced chest symptoms may have an oesophageal origin. The evaluation of similar therapeutic agents for migraine on oesophageal function may be justified.

Prevalence of abnormalities in knees detected by MRI in adults without knee osteoarthritis: population based observational study (Framingham Osteoarthritis Study).
OBJECTIVE: To examine use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of knees with no radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis to determine the prevalence of structural lesions associated with osteoarthritis and their relation to age, sex, and obesity. DESIGN: Population based observational study. SETTING: Community cohort in Framingham, MA, United States (Framingham osteoarthritis study). PARTICIPANTS: 710 people aged >50 who had no radiographic evidence of knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 0) and who underwent MRI of the knee. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of MRI findings that are suggestive of knee osteoarthritis (osteophytes, cartilage damage, bone marrow lesions, subchondral cysts, meniscal lesions, synovitis, attrition, and ligamentous lesions) in all participants and after stratification by age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and the presence or absence of knee pain. Pain was assessed by three different questions and also by WOMAC questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the 710 participants, 393 (55%) were women, 660 (93%) were white, and 206 (29%) had knee pain in the past month. The mean age was 62.3 years and mean BMI was 27.9. Prevalence of "any abnormality" was 89% (631/710) overall. Osteophytes were the most common abnormality among all participants (74%, 524/710), followed by cartilage damage (69%, 492/710) and bone marrow lesions (52%, 371/710). The higher the age, the higher the prevalence of all types of abnormalities detectable by MRI. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of any of the features between BMI groups. The prevalence of at least one type of pathology ("any abnormality") was high in both painful (90-97%, depending on pain definition) and painless (86-88%) knees. CONCLUSIONS: MRI shows lesions in the tibiofemoral joint in most middle aged and elderly people in whom knee radiographs do not show any features of osteoarthritis, regardless of pain.

[cell, nk, actin, receptor]

Super-resolution imaging of remodeled synaptic actin reveals different synergies between NK cell receptors and integrins.
Natural killer (NK) cells secrete lytic granules to directly kill virus-infected or transformed cells and secrete cytokines to communicate with other cells. Three-dimensional super-resolved images of F-actin, lytic granules, and IFN-γ in primary human NK cells stimulated through different activating receptors reveal that both IFN-γ and lytic granules accumulated in domains where the periodicity of the cortical actin mesh at the synapse opened up to be penetrable. Ligation of some activating receptors alone (eg, CD16 or NKG2D) was sufficient to increase the periodicity of the actin mesh, but surprisingly, ligation of others (eg, NKp46 or CD2) was not sufficient to induce cortical actin remodeling unless LFA-1 was coligated. Importantly, influenza virus particles that can be recognized by NK cells similarly did not open the actin mesh but could if LFA-1 was coligated. This leads us to propose that immune cells using germline-encoded receptors to directly recognize foreign proteins can use integrin recognition to differentiate between free pathogens and pathogen-infected cells that will both be present in blood. This distinction would not be required for NK cell receptors, such as NKG2D, which recognize host cell-encoded proteins that can only be found on diseased cells and not pathogens.

Deformation Micromechanics of Graphene Nanocomposites
Graphene nanocomposites have been successfully prepared in this study in the form of a sandwich structure of PMMA/graphene/SU-8. It has been proved that Raman spectroscopy is a powerful technique in the characterisation of the structure and deformation of graphene. The 2D band of the monolayer graphene has been used in the investigation of stress transfer in the graphene reinforced nanocomposites. It has been demonstrated that the 2D band moves towards low frequency linearly under tensile stress, which is shown to be significant method of monitoring the strain in graphene in a deformed specimen. The Raman spectroscopy behaviour under deformation validates that the monolayer graphene acts as a reinforcing role in nanocomposites although it is only one atom thick.A systematic investigation of the deformation of bilayer, trilayer and few-layer graphene has been undertaken with a view to determine the optimum number of layers for the reinforcement of nanocomposites. It has been demonstrated that monolayer graphene is not necessarily the optimum material to use for reinforcement in graphene-based polymer nanocomposites and bilayer graphene will be equally as good as monolayer graphene. There is therefore a balance to be struck in the design of graphene-based nanocomposites between the ability to achieve higher loadings of reinforcement and the reduction in effective Young’s modulus of the reinforcement, as the number of layers in the graphene is increased.Both the G and 2D bands have been found to undergo splitting under high strain levels or asymmetric band broadening in lower strain deformation. The G band polarisation property has been utilized to determine the crystallographic orientation of monolayer graphene by measuring the intensity ratio of G-/G+ bands. Analogously, the 2D band also undergoes strain-induced splitting where the 2D- band has higher Raman shift rate than that of the 2D+ band.

Copper modulates zinc metalloproteinase-dependent ectodomain shedding of key signalling and adhesion proteins and promotes the invasion of prostate cancer epithelial cells
A disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAMs) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc metalloproteinases (ZMPs) that catalyse the ‘ectodomain shedding’ of a range of cell surface proteins including signalling and adhesion molecules. These ‘sheddases’ are associated with the invasion and metastasis of a range of cancers. Increased serum and tumour tissue levels of copper are also observed in several cancers although little is known about how the metal might promote disease progression at the molecular level. In the current study, we investigated whether copper might regulate the ectodomain shedding of two key cell surface proteins implicated in the invasion and metastasis of prostate cancer, the Notch ligand Jagged1 and the adhesion molecule E-cadherin, and whether the metal was able to influence the invasion of the prostate cancer epithelial cell line PC3. Physiological copper concentrations stimulated the ZMP-mediated proteolysis of Jagged1 and E-cadherin in cell culture models whilst other divalent metals had no effect. Copper-mediated Jagged1 proteolysis was also observed following the pre-treatment of cells with cycloheximide and in a cell-free membrane system, indicating a post-translational mechanism of sheddase activation. Finally, the concentrations of copper that stimulated ZMP-mediated protein shedding also enhanced PC3 invasion; an effect which could be negated using a sheddase inhibitor or copper chelators. Collectively, these data implicate copper as an important factor in promoting prostate cancer cell invasion and indicate that the selective post-translational activation of ZMP-mediated protein shedding might play a role in this process.

The role of attractive interactions in rod-sphere mixtures
<p>We present a computer simulation study of binary mixtures of prolate Gay-Berne particles and Lennard-Jones spheres. Results are presented for three such rod-sphere systems which differ from each other only in the interaction between unlike particles. Both the mixing-demixing behavior and the transitions between the isotropic and any liquid crystalline phases are studied for each system, as a function of temperature and concentration ratio. For systems which show macroscopic demixing, the rod-sphere interaction is shown to give direct control over interfacial anchoring properties, giving rise to the possibility of micellar phase formation in the case of homeotropic anchoring. Additionally, it is shown that on incorporating high concentrations of spheres into a system of rods with weak demixing properties, microphase-separated structures can be induced, including bicontinuous and lamellar arrangements.</p>

Azole antifungal resistance today: focus on Aspergillus.
Oral triazole therapy is well established for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis (IPA), allergic aspergillosis (ABPA), and chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), and is often long-term. Resistance to triazole azole antifungal drugs in Aspergillus fumigatus is now a major clinical problem in a number of European locations, in China, Canada and the USA with particularly high frequencies from the north-west of the UK, and The Netherlands. A number of centers are reporting the continuing increasing frequency and evolution of resistance mechanisms in A. fumigatus, in both azole-naïve and patients treated with azoles. The increasing rate of resistance is of concern. A number of resistance mechanisms have been found. The biofilm modality of Aspergillus growth may have a number of therapeutic implications for aspergillosis, including antifungal resistance. Microbiological diagnosis of aspergillosis is limited by poor culture yield, leading to uncertainty about the frequency of triazole resistance. Direct resistance testing in culture-negative clinical samples may add additional insights into the prevalence of azole resistance in A. fumigatus.

Addition of novel degenerate electrical waveform stimulation with photodynamic therapy significantly enhances its cytotoxic effect in keloid fibroblasts: first report of a potential combination therapy.
BACKGROUND: We recently reported use of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for treating keloid disease (KD). However, in view of high recurrence rates post any treatment modality, adjuvant therapies should be considered. Additionally, we previously demonstrated the effect of a novel electrical waveform, the degenerate wave (DW) on differential gene expression in keloid fibroblasts. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we evaluated the in vitro cytotoxic effect of PDT at 5J/cm(2) and 10J/cm(2) of red light (633 ± 3nm) using 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) with and without DW, on keloid fibroblasts compared to normal skin fibroblasts. METHODS: The rate of intracellular photosensitizer (protoporphyrin IX, PPIX) generation and disintegration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, LDH cytotoxicity, WST-1 cytoproliferation, apoptosis by Caspase-3 activation, mitochondrial membrane potential assessment by JC-1 aggregates, qRT-PCR, flow cytometry and In-Cell Western Blotting were performed. RESULTS: PPIX accumulation and disintegration rate was higher in keloid than normal fibroblasts after incubation with MAL compared to ALA. Increased cytotoxicity and decreased cytoproliferation were observed for keloid fibroblasts after PDT+DW treatment compared to PDT alone. ROS generation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, apoptosis (Caspase-3 activation) and collagens I and III gene down-regulation were higher in keloid compared to normal skin fibroblasts after MAL-PDT+DW treatment. An increase in the number of cells entering apoptosis and necrosis was observed after PDT+DW treatment by flow cytometry analysis. All positive findings were statistically significant (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The cytotoxic effect of PDT on keloid fibroblasts can be enhanced significantly with addition of DW stimulation, indicating for the first time the utility of this potential combinational therapy.

Suicide pacts in the mentally ill: a national clinical survey.
There have been no detailed descriptions of psychiatric patients who have died by suicide pact. We examined the social and clinical characteristics of pact cases in England and Wales using a national clinical survey sample of people who died by suicide pact and who had been in recent (<12 months) contact with mental health services. Over the study period (1996-2005), there were 278 cases of suicide who had died in a pact, 77 (28%) of whom had been in recent service contact. The most common cause of death overall was by carbon monoxide poisoning, but those in contact with services were more likely to use more violent methods compared with other pact victims. Nearly half (47%) had affective disorder and 68% had previously self-harmed. Over a quarter (29%) had died within 3 months of discharge from psychiatric care and 36% had missed their last service appointment. Pact cases were more likely than solitary suicide cases to have experienced recent adverse life events, typically family problems. Measures that may prevent suicide pacts in the mentally ill include the effective treatment of depression and closer supervision in both in-patient and community settings. Awareness of the family environment may contribute to reduced risk.

Caveolin-1 and cancer metabolism in the tumor microenvironment: markers, models, and mechanisms.
Caveolins are a family of membrane-bound scaffolding proteins that compartmentalize and negatively regulate signal transduction. Recent studies have implicated a loss of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) expression in the pathogenesis of human cancers. Loss of Cav-1 expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts results in an activated tumor microenvironment, thereby driving early tumor recurrence, metastasis, and poor clinical outcome in breast and prostate cancers. We describe various paracrine signaling mechanism(s) by which the loss of stromal Cav-1 promotes tumor progression, including fibrosis, extracellular matrix remodeling, and the metabolic/catabolic reprogramming of cancer-associated fibroblast, to fuel the growth of adjacent tumor cells. It appears that oxidative stress is the root cause of initiation of the loss of stromal Cav-1 via autophagy, which provides further impetus for the use of antioxidants in anticancer therapy. Finally, we discuss the functional role of Cav-1 in epithelial cancer cells.

Genome-based phylogenetic analysis of Streptomyces and its relatives
Motivation: Streptomyces is one of the best-studied genera of the order Actinomycetales due to its great importance in medical science, ecology and the biotechnology industry. A comprehensive, detailed and robust phylogeny of Streptomyces and its relatives is needed for understanding how this group emerged and maintained such a vast diversity throughout evolution and how soil-living mycelial forms (e.g., Streptomyces s. str.) are related to parasitic, unicellular pathogens (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis) or marine species (e.g., Salinispora tropica). The most important application area of such a phylogenetic analysis will be in the comparative re-annotation of genome sequences and the reconstruction of Streptomyces metabolic networks for biotechnology. Methods: Classical 16S-rRNA-based phylogenetic reconstruction does not guarantee to produce well-resolved robust trees that reflect the overall relationship between bacterial species with widespread horizontal gene transfer. In our study we therefore combine three whole genome-based phylogenies with eight different, highly informative single-gene phylogenies to determine a new robust consensus tree of 45 Actinomycetales species with completely sequenced genomes. Results: None of the individual methods achieved a resolved phylogeny of Streptomyces and its relatives. Single-gene approaches failed to yield a detailed phylogeny; even though the single trees are in good agreement among each other, they show very low resolution of inner branches. The three whole genome-based methods improve resolution considerably. Only by combining the phylogenies from single gene-based and genome-based approaches we finally obtained a consensus tree with well-resolved branches for the entire set of Actinomycetales species. This phylogenetic information is stable and informative enough for application to the system-wide comparative modeling of bacterial physiology. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Connectivity-based structural and functional parcellation of the human cortex using diffusion imaging and tractography
The parcellation of the cortex via its anatomical properties has been an important research endeavor for over a century. To date, however, a universally accepted parcellation scheme for the human brain still remains elusive. In the current review, we explore the use of in vivo diffusion imaging and white matter tractography as a non-invasive method for the structural and functional parcellation of the human cerebral cortex, discussing the strengths and limitations of the current approaches. Cortical parcellation via white matter connectivity is based on the premise that, as connectional anatomy determines functional organization, it should be possible to segregate functionally-distinct cortical regions by identifying similarities and differences in connectivity profiles. Recent studies have provided initial evidence in support of the efficacy of this connectional parcellation methodology. Such investigations have identified distinct cortical subregions which correlate strongly with functional regions identified via fMRI and meta-analyses. Furthermore, a strong parallel between the cortical regions defined via tractographic and more traditional cytoarchitectonic parcellation methods has been observed. However, the degree of correspondence and relative functional importance of cytoarchitectonic- versus connectivity-derived parcellations still remains unclear. Diffusion tractography remains one of the only methods capable of visualizing the structural networks of the brain in vivo. As such, it is of vital importance to continue to improve the accuracy of the methodology and to extend its potential applications in the study of cognition in neurological health and disease.

Formation of Monolayer Graphene by Annealing Sacrificial Nickel Thin Films
Graphene films have been formed by annealing Ni thin films at 800 degrees C under vacuum conditions. The Ni thin films are deposited on Si/SiO(2) and, following annealing, have a polycrystalline morphology with grain sizes on the order of 1 mu m. Following growth, the Ni is removed by etching, and the graphene is transferred as a single continuous layer onto a separate surface. The fraction of monolayer graphene is investigated using optical and electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy and is shown to be >75\%.

[caveolin-3, muscle, mutation, disease]

Caveolinopathies: from the biology of caveolin-3 to human diseases.
In muscle tissue the protein caveolin-3 forms caveolae--flask-shaped invaginations localized on the cytoplasmic surface of the sarcolemmal membrane. Caveolae have a key role in the maintenance of plasma membrane integrity and in the processes of vesicular trafficking and signal transduction. Mutations in the caveolin-3 gene lead to skeletal muscle pathology through multiple pathogenetic mechanisms. Indeed, caveolin-3 deficiency is associated to sarcolemmal membrane alterations, disorganization of skeletal muscle T-tubule network and disruption of distinct cell-signaling pathways. To date, there have been 30 caveolin-3 mutations identified in the human population. Caveolin-3 defects lead to four distinct skeletal muscle disease phenotypes: limb girdle muscular dystrophy, rippling muscle disease, distal myopathy, and hyperCKemia. In addition, one caveolin-3 mutant has been described in a case of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Many patients show an overlap of these symptoms and the same mutation can be linked to different clinical phenotypes. This variability can be related to additional genetic or environmental factors. This review will address caveolin-3 biological functions in muscle cells and will describe the muscle and heart disease phenotypes associated with caveolin-3 mutations.

Precision mapping of the metabolome
The global study of the structure and dynamics of metabolic networks has been hindered by a lack of techniques that identify metabolites and their biochemical relationship in complex mixtures. The recent application of Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) to metabolomic analysis suggests a way to tackle the problem. A lower-cost alternative to high-field FTICR-MS, the Orbitrap mass analyzer, promises accelerated activity in this area. Here, we show how the ultra-high mass accuracy and resolution provided by this new generation of mass spectrometers can help to identify metabolites and connect them into metabolic networks. Data from perturbation studies and isotope-tracking experiments can complement this information to create metabolic maps de novo and chart unexplored areas of metabolism. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

[cxcl12, cell, expression, receptor, cxcr4]

CXCL12 receptor preference, signal transduction, biological response and the expression of 5T4 oncofoetal glycoprotein
CXCL12 is a pleiotropic chemokine capable of eliciting multiple signal transduction cascades and functions, via interaction with either CXCR4 or CXCR7. Factors that determine CXCL12 receptor preference, intracellular signalling route and biological response are poorly understood but are of central importance in the context of therapeutic intervention of the CXCL12 axis in multiple disease states. We have recently demonstrated that 5T4 oncofoetal glycoprotein facilitates functional CXCR4 expression leading to CXCL12 mediated chemotaxis in mouse embryonic cells. Using wild type (WT) and 5T4 knockout (5T4KO) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we now show that CXCL12 binding to CXCR4 activates both the ERK and AKT pathways within minutes, but while these pathways are intact they are non-functional in 5T4KO cells treated with CXCL12. Importantly, in the absence of 5T4 expression, CXCR7 is upregulated and becomes the predominant receptor for CXCL12, activating a distinct signal transduction pathway with slower kinetics involving transactivation of the EGFR, eliciting proliferation rather than chemotaxis. Thus the surface expression of 5T4 marks the use of the CXCR4 rather than the CXCR7 receptor, with distinct consequences for CXCL12 exposure, relevant to the spread and growth of a tumour. Consistent with this hypothesis we have identified human small cell lung carcinoma cells with similar 5T4/CXCR7 reciprocity that is predictive of biological response to CXCL12 and determined that 5T4 expression is required for functional chemotaxis in these cells.

Radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of paediatric microcystic lymphatic malformations.
Objective: Congenital lymphatic malformations are a challenging clinical problem. There is currently no universally accepted treatment for the management of microcystic disease. We describe the novel use of an existing technology (radiofrequency ablation, also termed Coblation) for the debulking of paediatric microcystic lymphatic malformations involving the upper aerodigestive tract. Methods: Five children with microcystic or mixed-type lymphatic malformations were included in this retrospective case series. Results: Each child had a satisfactory outcome following radiofrequency debulking, with improved oral intake and airway symptoms. No serious complications were reported. These findings constitute level IV evidence. Conclusion: We recommend radiofrequency ablation as a safe, viable alternative to existing techniques for the treatment of paediatric microcystic lymphatic malformations of the upper aerodigestive tract. Radiofrequency ablation achieves effective debulking of microcysts whilst avoiding excessive bleeding and thermal damage to surrounding tissues. This paper constitutes the first report of successful treatment of airway obstruction due to paediatric laryngopharyngeal microcystic disease, using radiofrequency ablation.

TE Mode Mixing Dynamics in Curved Multimode Optical Waveguides
Propagation of light through curved graded index optical waveguides supporting an arbitrary high number of modes is investigated. The discussion is restricted to optical wave fields which are well confined within the core region and losses through radiation are neglected. Using coupled mode theory formalism, two new forms for the propagation kernel for the transverse electric (TE) wave as it travels along a curved two-dimensional waveguide are presented. One form, involving the notion of "bend" modes, is shown to be attractive from a computational point of view as it allows an efficient numerical evaluation of the optical field for sharply bent waveguides.

Development of Surface Marker System for the Observation of Microstructural Changes in Nuclear Graphite using Micro X-ray Tomography
Current energy demands and future energy needs are a growing industry which at present attracts a large amount of research and investment of which nuclear energy is an integral part. Eight new nuclear stations are proposed to be developed in the UK over the next ten years to meet this demand. In order for nuclear energy to sustain growth and development, nuclear decommissioning of first and second generation power stations needs to be addressed in the U.K. and worldwide. Presently the UK has 36 graphite moderated reactors as a result of the UK military and civil programs, which over the next twenty years will close. This will result in ∼99’000 tonnes of irradiated graphite waste for which no current national decommissioning strategy exists. The main issues associated with this waste are the large volume and activation products associated. By far the greatest inventory is from 3H and 14C. An EU Euroatom FP7 Program; CARBOWASTE was established in 2008 with the aim of developing treatment and disposal options for graphite.This research is based within CARBOWASTE, the main objectives are to understand the mechanisms involved in the production, location and removal of radioisotopes from nuclear graphite. Computed X-ray Tomography (CT) will be used in order to quantify the initial porosity in conjunction with thermal treatment (ex situ) in order to eventually identify the location of 14C within the matrix of irradiated graphite, through the preferential chemically controlled oxidation of graphite. Unirradiated Pile Grade A graphite samples have been laser and manually marked in order align the samples prior to and post thermal treatment to determine the degree of porosity changes and weight loss under a range of thermal oxidation parameters

Combination of Voriconazole and Anidulafungin for Treatment of Triazole-Resistant Aspergillus fumigatus in an In Vitro Model of Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis.
Voriconazole is a first-line agent for the treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Isolates with elevated voriconazole MICs are increasingly being seen, and the optimal treatment regimen is not defined. We investigated whether the combination of voriconazole with anidulafungin may be beneficial for the treatment of A. fumigatus strains with elevated voriconazole MICs. We used an in vitro model of the human alveolus to define the exposure-response relationships for a wild-type strain (voriconazole MIC, 0.5 mg/liter) and strains with defined molecular mechanisms of triazole resistance (MICs, 4 to 16 mg/liter). All strains had anidulafungin minimum effective concentrations (MECs) of 0.0078 mg/liter. Exposure-response relationships were estimated using galactomannan as a biomarker. Concentrations of voriconazole and anidulafungin were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The interaction of voriconazole and anidulafungin was described using the Greco model. Fungal growth was progressively inhibited with higher drug exposures of voriconazole. Strains with elevated voriconazole MICs required proportionally greater voriconazole exposures to achieve a comparable antifungal effect. Galactomannan concentrations were only marginally reduced by anidulafungin monotherapy. An additive effect between voriconazole and anidulafungin was apparent. In conclusion, the addition of anidulafungin does not markedly alter the exposure-response relationship of voriconazole. A rise in serum galactomannan during combination therapy with voriconazole and anidulafungin should be interpreted as treatment failure and not attributed to a paradoxical reaction related to echinocandin treatment.

[urocortin, phenylephrine, hypertrophy, p300, acid, hypertrophic, effect, inhibitor, hdac, spiruchostatin]

The transcriptional coactivator p300 plays a critical role in the hypertrophic and protective pathways induced by phenylephrine in cardiac cells but is specific to the hypertrophic effect of urocortin.
Anacardic acid is an alkylsalicylic acid obtained from cashew-nut-shell liquid, and is a potent inhibitor of p300 histone acetyl-transferase (HAT) activity. We have used anacardic acid to prevent the induction of hypertrophy in isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Hypertrophy was detected as an increase in cell size, the rearrangement of sarcomeres into a striated pattern, and the induction of embryonic genes beta-MHC and ANF. p300 inhibition was equally effective at preventing hypertrophy whether it was induced by treatment with the alpha1-adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine, or by treatment with urocortin, a member of the corticotrophin-releasing-factor family, which stimulates specific G protein-coupled receptors. Spiruchostatin A is a natural-product inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDAC) similar to the depsipeptide FK228 molecule. We have recently synthesized spiruchostatin A and now show that, although HDACs act in opposition to HATs, spiruchostatin A has the same effect as anacardic acid, that is, it prevents the induction of hypertrophy in response to phenylephrine or urocortin. Pretreatment with either phenylephrine or urocortin reduced the extent of death observed after the exposure of isolated cardiomyocytes to simulated ischaemia and reoxygenation. Inhibition of p300 or HDAC activity eliminated the protection conferred by phenylephrine; however, it did not affect the protection conferred by urocortin. Therefore, it might eventually be possible to use chemical inhibitors such as these in a therapeutic setting to dissociate the protective effect and hypertrophic effect of urocortin, enhancing the survival of cardiomyocytes exposed to transient ischemia, while inhibiting the hypertrophic pathway that would otherwise be induced concurrently.

Outpatients with irritable bowel syndrome: a comparison of first time and chronic attenders.
Fifty two chronic clinic attenders with irritable bowel syndrome were compared with 97 newly referred patients in respect of physical symptoms and psychiatric status. Profound differences between the two groups emerged. Many abdominal and non-colonic symptoms were perceived as much more severe in chronic attenders compared with first time attenders (p less than 0.0001 for abdominal pain and abdominal distension). Chronic attenders were much more likely to complain of constant symptoms (p less than 0.05), and the social consequences of their illness were much more striking (p less than 0.0001). There was, however, no difference in the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in the two groups. Clinical trials and other investigations of the irritable bowel syndrome are usually conducted on hospital outpatient populations. The results of this study indicate that the patient populations used for these purposes need to be carefully defined.

Zero-Turbulence Manifold in a Toroidal Plasma
Sheared toroidal flows can cause bifurcations to zero-turbulent-transport states in tokamak plasmas. The maximum temperature gradients that can be reached are limited by subcritical turbulence driven by the parallel velocity gradient. Here it is shown that q/ϵ (magnetic field pitch/inverse aspect ratio) is a critical control parameter for sheared tokamak turbulence. By reducing q/ϵ, far higher temperature gradients can be achieved without triggering turbulence, in some instances comparable to those found experimentally in transport barriers. The zero-turbulence manifold is mapped out, in the zero-magnetic-shear limit, over the parameter space (γsubscript E, q/ϵ, R/Lsubscript T), where γsubscript E is the perpendicular flow shear and R/Lsubscript T is the normalized inverse temperature gradient scale. The extent to which it can be constructed from linear theory is discussed.

A Convergence Analysis of D-ILC Algorithm
ILC is an emerging technique for learning control. The D-ILC algorithm is the generic ILC scheme which captures the error trend of a batch to update the control input for the next batch or batches. The 2-dimensional nature requires in-depth convergence analysis of the algorithm. This paper addresses these issues in detail. This paper deals with the convergence properties of ILC algorithms with emphasis on control input. Discrete-time linear state space representation of a linear time-invariant system has been considered along with usual assumptions which ensure D-type ILC algorithm converges in terms of output error. The convergence for control input sequence is investigated up to component level.

Gefitinib for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer.
IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a leading target for treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Recent trials of the small-molecule EGFR inhibitor gefitinib have now more clearly defined indications for usage, and clinical and molecular factors predictive of benefit. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: A systematic search of the literature (Medline, ASCO, WCLC meeting abstracts) was performed from January 2000 to January 2010. The Phase III INTEREST study found gefitinib in unselected, pretreated patients was not inferior to docetaxel chemotherapy in overall survival, offering improved quality of life and superior toxicity profile. The Phase III IPASS study demonstrated improved progression-free survival with gefitinib compared with paclitaxel-carboplatin chemotherapy in chemotherapy-naive, never/light ex-smokers with adenocarcinoma histology. Stratifying for EGFR mutation revealed mutation-positive patients had superior outcomes with gefitinib compared with chemotherapy. Subsequent studies (WJOG4305, NEJ002), selecting only EGFR mutation-positive patients prospectively confirm this finding. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: The profile of gefitinib and landmark trials in NSCLC are summarized. How biomarkers may further optimize therapeutic benefit is highlighted. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Gefitinib is expected to have an important impact on management of pretreated and selected chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced NSCLC. In addition, activating EGFR mutations are proven to be of value for prediction of those who will derive most benefit.

Shear-aggregated fibronectin with anti-adhesive properties.
Biomaterials based on proteins, such as fibronectin, have the potential to guide cell and tissue behaviour during healing as a function of their unique mechanical and bioactive properties. Fibronectin has been reported as a scaffold for attachment of fibroblasts and subsequent deposition of collagen. We have recently developed a derivative process of shear-aggregated fibronectin that prevents cell attachment without causing cell death. This has potential applications in clinical situations where adhesions form across gliding surfaces and cause loss of function, e.g. peritoneal or flexor tendon adhesions. This in vitro study tested this derivative fibronectin biomaterial and its effects on aggressive adhesion-forming cells, using rabbit flexor tendon synovial fibroblasts. We investigated degradation of the novel biomaterial, and attachment of fibroblasts to glass coated with the biomaterial, relative to fibroblast attachment to uncoated and fibronectin-coated glass. We assessed infiltration of the derivative fibronectin biomaterial by fibroblasts and cytotoxicity of the biomaterial to fibroblasts. The interaction between fibroblasts and the derivative fibronectin biomaterial was visualized using time-lapse photography. The derivative fibronectin biomaterial dissolved by 88% of its mass by 3 weeks. Fibroblast attachment to the novel biomaterial was significantly reduced at 6 h. After 24 h of exposure to the novel biomaterial, fibroblasts did not migrate into it, there was no cell death and no attachment was seen using time-lapse. This novel derivative fibronectin biomaterial combines inhibition of fibroblast attachment with barrier effects and has suitable mechanical properties for surgical use in preventing adhesions in vivo.

Antigen-specific and non-specific depression of proliferative responses induced during contact sensitivity in mice.
Exposure of the flank of mice to either oxazolone or trinitrochlorobenzene (TNCB) 5 days prior to the application of oxazolone on the ear resulted in a reduced capacity of oxazolone-induced draining lymph node cells to express IL-2 receptors, produce IL-2, protein, RNA and DNA. However, histological examination of the draining lymph node suggest that antigen-specific and antigen-non-specific influences differ with respect to the frequency of pyroninophilic cells. Pre-exposure to oxazolone suppressed the number of oxazolone-induced pyroninophilic T cell blasts, whereas draining lymph nodes from TNCB-pretreated mice contained significantly more pyroninophilic cells than from oxazolone-pretreated mice. However, the majority of these cells were incorporating little or no thymidine. Thus exposure to certain contact sensitizers induces at least two systemic control mechanisms which serve to regulate subsequent lymphoproliferative responses. These mechanisms appear to exert their influences at different stages of in-vivo T cell activation.

[sequence, analysis, ssu, phylogeny, spumellarium, acantharea, fund, polycystinea, order, rrna]

A molecular approach to questions in the phylogeny of planktonic sarcodines
The Acantharea and the Polycystinea are two classes of sarcodines (Sarcodina)
which are exclusively planktonic and occur strictly in oligotrophic marine environments.
Although these protists have been the topic of research since Ernst Haeckel's systematic
investigations of samples from the H. M. S. Challenger Expedition, many aspects of their
phylogeny and systematics remain poorly resolved. Part of the problem is that the criteria
used in systematics of these groups until now has emphasized morphological elements
which may be similar due to convergence rather than common ancestry. The application of
molecular biology to the field of biological oceanography offers alternative approaches to
reexamining sarcodine phylogeny with the goal of producing classifications which reflect
evolutionary history.
The relationships of the Acantharea and the Polycystinea (order Spumellarida) to
other protists were investigated using phylogenetic analyses of small-subunit ribosomal
RNA (SSU rRNA) genes. Members of these two classes have been traditionally grouped
into the common superclass Actinopoda based on their specialized pseudopodia called
axopodia. Sequences from two orders of Acantharea (Symphyacanthida and
Chaunacanthida) and four representatives from the order Spumellarida and the class
Polycystinea (one solitary and three colonial spumellaria) were aligned against 25 other
eukaryotic SSU rRNA sequences extracted from a data base of more than 800 eukaryotic
sequences and subjected to distance, maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood
analyses. SSU rRNA-based phylogenies do not support the common ancestry of the
Acantharea and the Polycystinea, implying that the superclass Actinopoda is artificial and
should be discarded. The respective monophyly of the Acantharea and the Polycystinea
were supported in all analyses accomplished. The origin of the sequences was confirmed
by in situ hybridization experiments. SSU rRNA gene sequences for the solitary spumellarian Thalassicolla nucleata
were compared from individuals collected from the Sargasso Sea and the Pacific Ocean.
Sequences from pooled individuals showed primary structure differences which were
consistent with genus-level variation reported in the literature for unrelated taxa. These
results indicate that there may be different strains of this genus which are morphologically
identical or that perhaps there may be allelic variation within a given individual.
The evolutionary relationships between the solitary T. nucleata and seven colonial
spumellaria were analyzed to determine whether the two families of colonial spumellaria
(Collosphaeridae and Sphaerozoidae) form a monophyletic evolutionary assemblage.
Phylogenies inferred from distance and maximum likelihood methods did not support the
monophyly of the colony-forming spumellaria. Parsimony methods did support the
monophyly of the colonial spumellaria but with very low bootstrap support. The
monophyly of members from the Collosphaeridae family was supported in all analyses
with 100% bootstrap support while only distance analyses supported the monophyly of the
Sphaerozoidae. The possibility that coloniality has evolved more than once in the
Spumellarida has been suggested from observations of the fossil record. However,
contrary conclusions have been reached from studies based on skeletal morphogenesis.
The results obtained from molecular analyses question the utility of coloniality as a reliable
phylogenetic marker. Sequence variation within the SSU rRNA genes of the Spumellarida
appears to be sufficient enough for continued fine-scaled comparisons between existing
morphospecies.
The branching patterns within three of the four orders of the Acantharea were
examined using additional SSU rRNA gene sequence data from representatives of the
Symphyacanthida, Chaunacanthida and Arthracanthida. The results from this analysis
revealed a phylogeny which placed one representative of the Symphyacanthida
(Haliommatidium sp.) branching among the Arthracanthida. An examination of the
cytological features of Haliommatidium sp. in the literature revealed morphological
similarities it shares with the Arthracanthida that could corroborate this result. The
variability within acantharian SSU rDNA was significantly less than that observed in
spumellaria, and may prove less useful in establishing relationships at taxonomic categories
below the order level.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution September 1996This material is based upon work supported under a National Science Foundation

Proof-of-principle study to detect metabolic changes in peritoneal dialysis effluent in patients who develop encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis.
BACKGROUND: Prolonged peritoneal dialysis (PD) therapy can result in the development of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS), characterized by extensive sclerosis of the peritoneum with bowel adhesions often causing obstruction. METHODS: As a proof-of-principle study, holistic profiling of endogenous metabolites has been applied in a prospective collection of PD effluent collected in multiple UK renal centres over 6 years in order to investigate metabolic differences in PD effluent between PD therapy patients who later developed clinically defined EPS (n = 11) and controls, who were matched for PD vintage, age and gender (n = 11). RESULTS: 'Fit-for-purpose' analytical methods employing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS), direct injection MS and quality control samples were developed and validated. These methods were applied in a proof-of-principle study to define metabolic differences in PD effluent related to subsequent development of EPS. Changes in amino acids, amines and derivatives, short-chain fatty acids and derivatives and sugars were observed prior to EPS developing, and changes in the metabolomic profiles could be detected. CONCLUSION: There is potential for applying metabolic profiles to identify patients at risk of developing EPS although long-term prospective studies with larger patient cohorts are required.

[pak1, hypertrophy, mouse, heart, cardiac, antihypertrophic, cko]

Pak1 as a novel therapeutic target for antihypertrophic treatment in the heart.
BACKGROUND: Stress-induced hypertrophic remodeling is a critical pathogenetic process leading to heart failure. Although many signal transduction cascades are demonstrated as important regulators to facilitate the induction of cardiac hypertrophy, the signaling pathways for suppressing hypertrophic remodeling remain largely unexplored. In this study, we identified p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) as a novel signaling regulator that antagonizes cardiac hypertrophy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Hypertrophic stress applied to primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) or murine hearts caused the activation of Pak1. Analysis of NRCMs expressing constitutively active Pak1 or in which Pak1 was silenced disclosed that Pak1 played an antihypertrophic role. To investigate the in vivo role of Pak1 in the heart, we generated mice with a cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Pak1 (Pak1(cko)). When subjected to 2 weeks of pressure overload, Pak1(cko) mice developed greater cardiac hypertrophy with attendant blunting of JNK activation compared with controls, and these knockout mice underwent the transition into heart failure when prolonged stress was applied. Chronic angiotensin II infusion also caused increased cardiac hypertrophy in Pak1(cko) mice. Moreover, we discovered that the Pak1 activator FTY720, a sphingosine-like analog, was able to prevent pressure overload-induced hypertrophy in wild-type mice without compromising their cardiac functions. Meanwhile, FTY720 failed to exert such an effect on Pak1(cko) mice, suggesting that the antihypertrophic effect of FTY720 likely acts through Pak1 activation. CONCLUSIONS: These results, for the first time, establish Pak1 as a novel antihypertrophic regulator and suggest that it may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.

Diathermy-induced injury may affect detection of occult tubal lesions at risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy.
BACKGROUND: Electrosurgery-induced tubal thermal injury obscures cellular detail and hampers histomorphological assessment for occult pathology. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to report on diathermy-related thermal injuries to the fallopian tube observed at RRSO and explore its potential impact on the detection of occult tubal epithelial lesions. DESIGN: This study was composed of high-risk women from breast and/or ovarian cancer families attending a tertiary high-risk familial gynecologic cancer clinic. This was a retrospective case-control analysis of high-risk women who underwent RRSO. Cases were all women detected to have occult lesions (tubal atypia/carcinoma in situ/cancer) between January 2005 and December 2010. Control subjects were all women with normal tubal/ovarian histology between August 2006 and December 2007. METHODS: Two pathologists performed histopathologic assessment for grade of thermal injury. Tubal diathermy injury rates were compared between cases and controls. Statistical analysis was undertaken using SPSS version 18. The Mann-Whitney U test compared age distributions; χ/Fisher tests, the difference between proportions, and γ test, the difference in ordinal variables between the groups. RESULTS: A novel tubal thermal index to describe the severity of injury is reported. Lack of fimbrial thermal injury is twice as likely (odds ratio, 2.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-3.92) to be associated with detection of occult tubal pathology, whereas isthmic injury does not affect detection rate (P = 0.744). The groups were comparable with respect to age at RRSO (P = 0.531) and the presence of BRCA mutations (P = 0.192). CONCLUSIONS: This report highlights the potential impact of electrosurgical thermal injury on detection of occult tubal pathology following RRSO. It is important for surgeons to avoid thermal injury to the distal end of the tube.

[haqp1, blocker, human, novel]

Discovery of Novel Human Aquaporin-1 Blockers
Human aquaporin-1 (hAQP1) is a water channel found in many tissues and potentially involved in several human pathologies. Selective inhibitors of hAQP1 are discussed as novel treatment opportunities for glaucoma, brain edema, inflammatory pain, and certain types of cancer. However, only very few potent and chemically attractive blockers have been reported to date. In this study we present three novel hAQP1 blockers that have been identified by virtual screening and inhibit water flux through hAQP1 in Xenopus laevis oocyte swelling assays at low micromolar concentrations. The newly discovered compounds display no chemical similarity to hitherto known hAQP1 blockers and bind at the extracellular entrance of the channel, close to the ar/R selectivity filter. Futhermore, mutagenesis studies showed that Lys36, which is not conserved among the hAQP family, is crucially involved in binding and renders the discovered compounds suitable as leads for the development of selective hAQP1 inhibitors.

[factor, apoptosis, anti-apoptotic, apoptotic]

Clinical implications of apoptosis in ischemic myocardium.
Apoptosis, a genetically programmed form of cell death, contributes to myocyte cell loss in a variety of cardiac pathologies, including cardiac failure and those related to ischemia/reperfusion injury. The apoptotic program is complex, involving both pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, and apoptosis occurs when the equilibrium between these opposing factors is perturbed. Some of these factors are intrinsic to the apoptotic pathway, such as the pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl2 family. Other, extrinsic, cellular factors can also modify the outcome of the response to an apoptotic stimulus. In this review, we have focused on some of these extrinsic factors, such as STAT-1 as a pro-apoptotic agent and the urocortins and Bag-1 as anti-apoptotic factors, since these may be potential therapeutic targets. In addition, we discuss the profound cytoprotective effects of the antibiotic, minocycline.

Separating the wheat from the chaff: A prioritisation pipeline for the analysis of metabolomics datasets
Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry {(LC-MS)} is a powerful and widely applied method for the study of biological systems, biomarker discovery and pharmacological interventions. {LC-MS} measurements are, however, significantly complicated by several technical challenges, including: (1) ionisation suppression/enhancement, disturbing the correct quantification of analytes, and (2) the detection of large amounts of separate derivative ions, increasing the complexity of the spectra, but not their information content. Here we introduce an experimental and analytical strategy that leads to robust metabolome profiles in the face of these challenges. Our method is based on rigorous filtering of the measured signals based on a series of sample dilutions. Such data sets have the additional characteristic that they allow a more robust assessment of detection signal quality for each metabolite. Using our method, almost 80\% of the recorded signals can be discarded as uninformative, while important information is retained. As a consequence, we obtain a broader understanding of the information content of our analyses and a better assessment of the metabolites detected in the analyzed data sets. We illustrate the applicability of this method using standard mixtures, as well as cell extracts from bacterial samples. It is evident that this method can be applied in many types of {LC-MS} analyses and more specifically in untargeted metabolomics. ?? 2011 The Author(s).

[allele, age, onset, normal, cag, repeat, motor, interaction, length]

CAG repeat expansion in Huntington disease determines age at onset in a fully dominant fashion.
OBJECTIVE: Age at onset of diagnostic motor manifestations in Huntington disease (HD) is strongly correlated with an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat. The length of the normal CAG repeat allele has been reported also to influence age at onset, in interaction with the expanded allele. Due to profound implications for disease mechanism and modification, we tested whether the normal allele, interaction between the expanded and normal alleles, or presence of a second expanded allele affects age at onset of HD motor signs. METHODS: We modeled natural log-transformed age at onset as a function of CAG repeat lengths of expanded and normal alleles and their interaction by linear regression. RESULTS: An apparently significant effect of interaction on age at motor onset among 4,068 subjects was dependent on a single outlier data point. A rigorous statistical analysis with a well-behaved dataset that conformed to the fundamental assumptions of linear regression (e.g., constant variance and normally distributed error) revealed significance only for the expanded CAG repeat, with no effect of the normal CAG repeat. Ten subjects with 2 expanded alleles showed an age at motor onset consistent with the length of the larger expanded allele. CONCLUSIONS: Normal allele CAG length, interaction between expanded and normal alleles, and presence of a second expanded allele do not influence age at onset of motor manifestations, indicating that the rate of HD pathogenesis leading to motor diagnosis is determined by a completely dominant action of the longest expanded allele and as yet unidentified genetic or environmental factors.

Controlled Islanding Strategy Considering Power System Restoration Constraints
This paper proposes a methodology to split the power system across the weak areas of the network affected by a large disturbance, which might lead to a total system blackout. The final splitting strategy is carried out by opening the transmission lines with minimum power exchanged, i.e. by minimising the power exchange between areas. Since one or more of the created islands might reach an unstable operating point, and therefore, cause a power system blackout, the proposed methodology includes at least one blackstart unit within each island and assures sufficient generation capability to match the load consumption within each island. By assuring blackstart availability and sufficient generation capability, parallel power system restoration is planned in case of any eventuality. For validation purposes, the methodology is implemented and tested on the IEEE 9-bus and 118-bus test systems.

Femtosecond carrier dynamics in bulk graphite and graphene paper
Femtosecond white-light continuum probe transient absorption and reflectivity measurements of bulk graphite and graphene paper are reported. In graphite, the relaxation of photoinduced electron-hole pairs happens through in-plane electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering in similar or equal to 200 fs, while the ps dynamics is due to the modulation of the electronic structure by out-of-plane structural motions. The ps dynamics of the optical signal is strongly reduced in graphene paper, where the out-of-plane bond is disrupted, while the short component of the dynamics is identical in both materials. These results show that in 2D-graphene, the carrier relaxation occurs in similar or equal to 200 fs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

[hybridization, information, gene, comparative]

Improving the power to detect differentially expressed genes in comparative microarray experiments by including information from self-self hybridizations.
Our ability to detect differentially expressed genes in a microarray experiment can be hampered when the number of biological samples of interest is limited. In this situation, we propose the use of information from self-self hybridizations to acuminate our inference of differential expression. A unified modelling strategy is developed to allow better estimation of the error variance. This principle is similar to the use of a pooled variance estimate in the two-sample t-test. The results from real dataset examples suggest that we can detect more genes that are differentially expressed in the combined models. Our simulation study provides evidence that this method increases sensitivity compared to using the information from comparative hybridizations alone, given the same control for false discovery rate. The largest increase in sensitivity occurs when the amount of information in the comparative hybridization is limited.

[disease, malnutrition, ssc, intervention, nutritional]

Malnutrition in systemic sclerosis.
SSc is a chronic multi-system disease with wide-reaching consequences. Gastrointestinal features are present in over 90% of cases and these, together with other disease manifestations, may lead to nutritional decline. This produces substantial morbidity, including reliance on enteral support and even parenteral nutrition-dependent intestinal failure. These complications carry an associated mortality. Up to 18% of patients with SSc are reported to be at high risk of malnutrition as assessed by Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) criteria, with risk increasing with disease severity. Little is known about this decline, its rate of progression and how it affects the individual. Few case series report on nutritional interventions. Most current interventions are based on experience in other diseases. The development of specialist knowledge of SSc-related gastrointestinal disease management and nutritional screening and interventions is required. This paper reviews current knowledge relating to malnutrition and its management in SSc.

Developing outcome measures in orthodontics that reflect patient and provider values.
During the past decade, emphasis in orthodontics has been directed toward the development of outcome measures from both the patient and clinician perspectives. New methodological standards of rigor have been introduced into research design to eliminate bias and test well-defined questions. Sample size calculations and established exclusion and inclusion criteria define sample populations and the ability to statistically accept or reject hypothesis-driven clinical studies. Although advances in our understanding of evidence-based medicine and dentistry from the provider perspective have been productive, the emerging value placed on patient perspective has not been as forthcoming. The emphasis placed on patient-oriented clinical research has resulted in new constructs of surveys and questionnaires in which the items are derived and tested from the patient's point of view. Because orthodontics is a condition without the natural history of a disease process for which no intervention has predictable consequences, new strategies have been developed to estimate need and demand for orthodontic treatment. Studies to measure seekers and nonseekers of orthodontic treatment are reported, as well as sex and cross-cultural issues in the use of established process and outcome measures. The design of clinical studies is discussed in the context of future directions for clinical research, and the usefulness of the information generated will directly relate to providing patients with the necessary information to make decisions and hence knowledgeably give informed consent for treatment interventions.

[wound, larva, patient, debridement]

Therapeutic applications of the larvae for wound debridement.
It has been known for centuries that application of larvae is useful to heal certain wounds by facilitating debridement of necrotic tissue. Their therapeutic use was popularised in the beginning of the 19th century, but waned in the 1940s with the advent of antiseptic wound management and antibiotics. In more recent years, larvae are once again in vogue for management of difficult wounds. The mechanism of wound debridement by larvae includes the complete wound by continuous larval motion, secretion of proteolytic enzymes and antibacterial substances, effects on epidermal growth factor and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and ingestion and digestion of bacteria and necrotic tissue. In our study, wound debridement was achieved satisfactorily in 29 of 34 patients (85%) with chronic wounds. In the remaining five patients, failures occurred due to inadequate sealing in two patients (6%), death of larvae in two patients (6%) and treatment intolerance in one patient (3%). Larval therapy should be considered as a therapeutic option in the management of certain difficult wounds.

A genome-wide association study identifies new psoriasis susceptibility loci and an interaction between HLA-C and ERAP1.
To identify new susceptibility loci for psoriasis, we undertook a genome-wide association study of 594,224 SNPs in 2,622 individuals with psoriasis and 5,667 controls. We identified associations at eight previously unreported genomic loci. Seven loci harbored genes with recognized immune functions (IL28RA, REL, IFIH1, ERAP1, TRAF3IP2, NFKBIA and TYK2). These associations were replicated in 9,079 European samples (six loci with a combined P < 5 × 10⁻⁸ and two loci with a combined P < 5 × 10⁻⁷). We also report compelling evidence for an interaction between the HLA-C and ERAP1 loci (combined P = 6.95 × 10⁻⁶). ERAP1 plays an important role in MHC class I peptide processing. ERAP1 variants only influenced psoriasis susceptibility in individuals carrying the HLA-C risk allele. Our findings implicate pathways that integrate epidermal barrier dysfunction with innate and adaptive immune dysregulation in psoriasis pathogenesis.

Corneal confocal microscopy: a novel non-invasive technique to quantify small fibre pathology in peripheral neuropathies.
The accurate quantification of peripheral neuropathy is important to define at risk patients, anticipate deterioration, and assess new therapies. Conventional methods assess neurological deficits and electrophysiology and quantitative sensory testing quantifies functional alterations to detect neuropathy. However, the earliest damage appears to be to the small fibres and yet these tests primarily assess large fibre dysfunction and have a limited ability to demonstrate regeneration and repair. The only techniques which allow a direct examination of unmyelinated nerve fibre damage and repair are sural nerve biopsy with electron microscopy and skin-punch biopsy. However, both are invasive procedures and require lengthy laboratory procedures and considerable expertise. Corneal Confocal microscopy is a non-invasive clinical technique which provides in-vivo imaging of corneal nerve fibres. We have demonstrated early nerve damage, which precedes loss of intraepidermal nerve fibres in skin biopsies together with stratification of neuropathic severity and repair following pancreas transplantation in diabetic patients. We have also demonstrated nerve damage in idiopathic small fibre neuropathy and Fabry's disease.

Toxic dilatation of colon in Crohn's disease.
12 cases of toxic dilatation of the colon in Crohn's disease were reviewed. In 11 this complication seemed to be the first manifestation of the disease and a considerable diagnostic delay may partly account for the strikingly high mortality (50%). On admission 83% had clinical features suggestive of Crohn's disease and 58% had experienced symptoms suggestive of preceding gastrointestinal disease. An iatrogenic precipitating factor was identifiable in all but the 1 patient with established disease and in 83% of cases antidiarrhoeals had been prescribed. Preoperative perforation occurred in 4 patients, 3 of whom had had a barium-enema examination, and thromboembolism was a common postoperative complication (50%). Fever, tachycardia, low serum calcium, and low serum albumin in a patient with diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and distension should alert the physician to the possibility of Crohn's disease even in the absence of preexisting symptoms. Sigmoidoscopy should be an early investigation with particular attention being paid to perianal disease.

Neurodegenerative diseases: Lessons from genome-wide screens in small model organisms
Various age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, polyglutamine expansion diseases and Alzheimer's disease, are associated with the accumulation of misfolded proteins in aggregates in the brain. How and why these proteins form aggregates and cause disease is still poorly understood. Small model organisms-the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster -have been used to model these diseases and high-throughput genetic screens using these models have led to the identification of a large number of genes that modify aggregation and toxicity of the disease proteins. In this review, we revisit these models and provide a comprehensive comparison of the genetic screens performed so far. Our integrative analysis highlights alterations of a wide variety of basic cellular processes. Not all disease proteins are influenced by alterations in the same cellular processes and despite the unifying theme of protein misfolding and aggregation, the pathology of each of the age-related misfolding disorders can be induced or influenced by a disease-protein-specific subset of molecular processes. ?? 2009 EMBO Molecular Medicine.

[lta, pgp, neutrophil, inflammation]

A critical role for LTA4H in limiting chronic pulmonary neutrophilic inflammation.
Leukotriene A(4) hydrolase (LTA(4)H) is a proinflammatory enzyme that generates the inflammatory mediator leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)). LTA(4)H also possesses aminopeptidase activity with unknown substrate and physiological importance; we identified the neutrophil chemoattractant proline-glycine-proline (PGP) as this physiological substrate. PGP is a biomarker for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is implicated in neutrophil persistence in the lung. In acute neutrophil-driven inflammation, PGP was degraded by LTA(4)H, which facilitated the resolution of inflammation. In contrast, cigarette smoke, a major risk factor for the development of COPD, selectively inhibited LTA(4)H aminopeptidase activity, which led to the accumulation of PGP and neutrophils. These studies imply that therapeutic strategies inhibiting LTA(4)H to prevent LTB(4) generation may not reduce neutrophil recruitment because of elevated levels of PGP.

Social Death: A Grounded Theory Study of the Emotional and Social Effects of Honour Killing on Victims’ Family Members- A Palestinian Family Perspective
The University of ManchesterAbstract of thesis submitted by Salam Alkhatib on 4 September 2012for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy, entitled:A Grounded Theory Study of the emotional and social effects of honour killing on Victims’ family members- A Palestinian family perspectiveAbstract The murder of women in order to uphold ‘honour’ has occurred throughout history and in many contexts. Despite high rates of domestic violence and increased rates of honour killing over the last decade in Palestine, there is a paucity of empirical data about the phenomenon, the social and cultural forces underlying it and how it affects family members emotionally and socially. The standpoint of this thesis is that Palestinian society today has no solution to honour killing (HK). This study addresses two questions: the factors that contribute to HK, as reported by the participants; and the emotional and social effects and consequences of it. The study adopted a Grounded Theory method. Data were collected using individual and group interviews with family members, professionals and neighbours associated with victims of HK. The total numbers of the participants were 43 (23 family members, 15 professionals and 5 neighbours). A feminist paradigm guided the data collection and analysis. The findings of this study have revealed that the HK phenomenon is multifaceted, grounded in the interplay of several complex factors, including institutionalized patriarchy within society, families and Palestinian culture; honour and shame values in the traditional society and other societal influences (cultural norms and values, legislative and institutional systems). This study therefore concluded that HKs were patriarchal and traditional methods of disempowering and subjugating women, enabled (directly or indirectly) by families, communities, political parties, religious leaders, professionals and the state, rendering society at large as unlikely to condemn honour killing. The main result was that although family members killed their female relatives primarily in an attempt to re-establish their honour, the murder failed in this purpose and in fact made their situation worse. Understanding this significant finding gives a clear message to family members and to the public that honour killing harms perpetrators emotionally and further damages family honour, where enter into a long process which ultimately leads to social death. Thus, multiple efforts are needed to combat HK, but this is extremely difficult. Altering the attitudes and behaviour of those who believe in HK is not an easy task but one of the first and crucial steps in combating this issue is state action. This study shows that most participants, especially family members, were concerned about family reputation and endeavoured to resolve problems within the family. This makes solving the problems inside families more difficult for any external party. Therefore, it is necessary to find ways to work with families. Further research has the potential to increase our understanding of other social factors and processes involved in honour killing, which would enable concerned parties to better craft effective intervention strategies.

Biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and metabolism of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) using ¹⁸F-IL1RA and PET imaging in rats.
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Positron emission tomography (PET) has the potential to improve our understanding of the preclinical pharmacokinetics and metabolism of therapeutic agents, and is easily translated to clinical studies in humans. However, studies involving proteins radiolabelled with clinically relevant PET isotopes are currently limited. Here we illustrate the potential of PET imaging in a preclinical study of the biodistribution and metabolism of ¹⁸F-labelled IL-1 receptor antagonist (¹⁸FIL-1RA) using a novel ¹⁸F-radiolabelling technique. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: IL-1RA was radiolabelled by reductive amination on lysine moieties with ¹⁸Ffluoroacetaldehyde. Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intravenously with ¹⁸FIL-1RA and imaged with a PET camera for 2 h. For the study of IL-1RA metabolites by ex vivoγ-counting of samples, rats were killed 20 min, 1 h or 2 h after injection of ¹⁸FIL-1RA. KEY RESULTS: ¹⁸FIL-1RA distribution into the major organs of interest was as follows: kidneys > liver > lungs > brain. In lungs and liver, ¹⁸FIL-1RA uptake peaked within 1 min post-injection then decreased rapidly to reach a plateau from 10 min post-injection. In the brain, the uptake exhibited slower pharmacokinetics with a smaller post-injection peak and a plateau from 6 min onward. IL-1RA was rapidly metabolized and these metabolites represented ∼40% of total activity in plasma and ∼80% in urine, 20 min after injection. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Preclinical PET imaging is a feasible method of assessing the biodistribution of new biological compounds of therapeutic interest rapidly. The biodistribution of ¹⁸FIL-1RA reported here is in agreement with an earlier study suggesting low uptake in the normal brain, with rapid metabolism and excretion via the kidneys.

Factors associated with the seroprevalence of 26 cutaneous and two genital human papillomavirus types in organ transplant patients.
Viral skin infections are commonly present in organ transplant recipients (OTR). In this study, we aimed to identify factors associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infections in OTR. Patients with solid-organ transplants were recruited from the outpatient nephrology and dermatology clinics in five European countries. Only patients with no current or past skin cancer were included in this analysis. Serum samples were analysed for antibodies to the L1 proteins of 26 cutaneous and two genital HPV types from five phylogenetic genera (α, β, γ, μ and ν). The most consistent association was found between recreational sun exposure and the seroprevalence of all tested genera, except α. The antibody presence of any β type was higher among people who had been transplanted at least 23 years prior to participation than in those who had been transplanted for less than 7 years. The prevalence of two γ-HPV types (60 and 65) and three β-HPV types (15, 38 and 49) was associated with time since transplantation. The presence of a high number of warts was associated with the presence of any μ-PV or ν-PV types, and having greater than 50 keratotic skin lesions was almost significantly associated with the presence of antibodies to two or more γ-PV. Discrepancies in the results of the present study, as well as in previous reports, may depend on different methodologies and on geographical variations. Our results also indicate that further research with more standardized methods is needed to clarify the role of cutaneous HPV in OTR.

[ratite, sequence, taxa, extinct]

Complete mitochondrial genome sequences of two extinct moas clarify ratite evolution.
The origin of the ratites, large flightless birds from the Southern Hemisphere, along with their flighted sister taxa, the South American tinamous, is central to understanding the role of plate tectonics in the distributions of modern birds and mammals. Defining the dates of ratite divergences is also critical for determining the age of modern avian orders. To resolve the ratite phylogeny and provide biogeographical data to examine these issues, we have here determined the first complete mitochondrial genome sequences of any extinct taxa--two New Zealand moa genera--along with a 1,000-base-pair sequence from an extinct Madagascan elephant-bird. For comparative data, we also generated 12 kilobases of contiguous sequence from the kiwi, cassowary, emu and two tinamou genera. This large dataset allows statistically precise estimates of molecular divergence dates and these support a Late Cretaceous vicariant speciation of ratite taxa, followed by the subsequent dispersal of the kiwi to New Zealand. This first molecular view of the break-up of Gondwana provides a new temporal framework for speciation events within other Gondwanan biota and can be used to evaluate competing biogeographical hypotheses.

[memantine, ad, donepezil, placebo, treatment, cholinesterase, trial, moderate, dementia, inhibitor]

DOMINO-AD protocol: donepezil and memantine in moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease - a multicentre RCT.
BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the commonest cause of dementia. Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, are the drug class with the best evidence of efficacy, licensed for mild to moderate AD, while the glutamate antagonist memantine has been widely prescribed, often in the later stages of AD. Memantine is licensed for moderate to severe dementia in AD but is not recommended by the England and Wales National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. However, there is little evidence to guide clinicians as to what to prescribe as AD advances; in particular, what to do as the condition progresses from moderate to severe. Options include continuing cholinesterase inhibitors irrespective of decline, adding memantine to cholinesterase inhibitors, or prescribing memantine instead of cholinesterase inhibitors. The aim of this trial is to establish the most effective drug option for people with AD who are progressing from moderate to severe dementia despite treatment with donepezil. METHOD: DOMINO-AD is a pragmatic, 15 centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial. Patients with AD, currently living at home, receiving donepezil 10 mg daily, and with Standardized Mini-Mental State Examination (SMMSE) scores between 5 and 13 are being recruited. Each is randomized to one of four treatment options: continuation of donepezil with memantine placebo added; switch to memantine with donepezil placebo added; donepezil and memantine together; or donepezil placebo with memantine placebo. 800 participants are being recruited and treatment continues for one year. Primary outcome measures are cognition (SMMSE) and activities of daily living (Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale). Secondary outcomes are non-cognitive dementia symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory), health related quality of life (EQ-5D and DEMQOL-proxy), carer burden (General Health Questionnaire-12), cost effectiveness (using Client Service Receipt Inventory) and institutionalization. These outcomes are assessed at baseline, 6, 18, 30 and 52 weeks. All participants will be subsequently followed for 3 years by telephone interview to record institutionalization. DISCUSSION: There is considerable debate about the clinical and cost effectiveness of anti-dementia drugs. DOMINO-AD seeks to provide clear evidence on the best treatment strategies for those managing patients at a particularly important clinical transition point.

[asthma, atopy, allele, rante, airway, atopic]

The -403 G-->A promoter polymorphism in the RANTES gene is associated with atopy and asthma.
Asthma is a complex inflammatory condition often associated with bronchial hyperreactivity and atopy. Genetic and environmental factors are implicated and several candidate genes have been implicated. Of these, the chemokine RANTES is responsible for the recruitment of inflammatory cells such as eosinophils and T-lymphocytes. We have recently identified a polymorphism within the RANTES promoter (-403 G-->A) and have examined its role, using a PCR-RFLP assay, in the development of atopy and asthma in 201 Caucasian subjects. Atopic status was determined using skin prick testing and serum IgE levels. Severity of airway dysfunction was assessed using spirometric measurement (FEV1) and methacholine challenge (PC20). The -403 A allele was associated with an increased susceptibility to both atopy and asthma. Thus, the proportion of subjects carrying this allele was higher in each of atopic non-asthmatics, non-atopic asthmatics and atopic asthmatics compared with non-atopic, non-asthmatic controls. In particular, this allele was associated with skin test positivity but not IgE level. Homozygosity for the -403 A allele conferred a 6.5-fold increased risk of moderate/severe airway obstruction (FEV1 < or = 80% predicted), a marker for established asthma. Our data, whilst preliminary, indicate that the association of RANTES genotype with both atopy and asthma reflect independent effects, suggesting different mechanisms for the role of this chemokine in atopy and development of airway obstruction.

Gene expression analysis of myeloid and lymphoid lineage markers during mouse haematopoiesis.
Expression profiling of haematopoietic cells is hampered by the heterogeneous nature of haematopoietic tissues and the absolute rarity of early unrestricted progenitors. To overcome this, the expression profile of lymphoid and myeloid-associated genes (LEF1, EBF, CD19, Sox-4, B29, CD45, C-fms, lysozyme, PU.1 and CD5) were investigated in 40 mouse myeloid haematopoietic precursors covering the entire haematopoietic hierarchy from multipotential to committed single lineages. The lineage-specific expression seen in single-cell studies was confirmed by examining fractionated bone marrow, whole tissues and differentiation of the multipotent cell line FDCP (Factor Dependent Cell Paterson) mix. Analysis of the 40 single myeloid precursors failed to detect expression of lymphoid-associated genes, LEF1, EBF, CD19 and CD5, despite detection in lymphoid cell controls. Surprisingly, the lymphoid-associated genes, Sox-4 and B29 were detected in the single myeloid precursors, which was confirmed in bone marrow and a multipotential myeloid cell line. The pattern of Sox-4 and B29, is consistent with a potential role in the commitment of bipotential granulocytic/macrophage precursors towards the granulocyte or macrophage lineage. In addition to providing baseline values for myeloid and lymphoid lineage markers during mouse haematopoiesis, these results highlight the importance of single-cell analysis in the study of complex tissues.

[neutrino, year]

Viewpoint: Rethinking the Neutrino
To some, this may be the year of the dragon, but in neutrino physics, this is the year of θsubscript 13. Only one year ago, this supposedly “tiny” mixing angle, which describes how neutrinos oscillate from one mass state to another, was undetected, but the last twelve months have seen a flurry of results from experiments in Asia and Europe, culminating in the result from the Daya Bay Collaboration, now being reported in Physical Review Letters, that shows that θsubscript 13 is not small after all 1. A not-so-tiny mixing angle forces us to rethink theory, calling for new explanations for why quarks and leptons are so different. It also opens the door to new experiments, potentially allowing the discovery of CP violation—a difference between neutrinos and antineutrinos that may be related to the matter asymmetry of the early universe.

All measurements are performed in a scanning electron microscope allowing accurate knowledge of the local environment of the nanotube to be obtained. It is shown that the presence of the grounded gate electrode screens the applied field by approximately 32%. This technique in positioning the gate and anode electrodes allows for an estimate of the gate transparency factor and demonstrates characterization of individual carbon nanotubes without the need for fabrication of arrays of emitters.</p>

The dynamics and prognostic potential of DNA methylation changes at stem cell gene loci in women's cancer.
Aberrant DNA methylation is an important cancer hallmark, yet the dynamics of DNA methylation changes in human carcinogenesis remain largely unexplored. Moreover, the role of DNA methylation for prediction of clinical outcome is still uncertain and confined to specific cancers. Here we perform the most comprehensive study of DNA methylation changes throughout human carcinogenesis, analysing 27,578 CpGs in each of 1,475 samples, ranging from normal cells in advance of non-invasive neoplastic transformation to non-invasive and invasive cancers and metastatic tissue. We demonstrate that hypermethylation at stem cell PolyComb Group Target genes (PCGTs) occurs in cytologically normal cells three years in advance of the first morphological neoplastic changes, while hypomethylation occurs preferentially at CpGs which are heavily Methylated in Embryonic Stem Cells (MESCs) and increases significantly with cancer invasion in both the epithelial and stromal tumour compartments. In contrast to PCGT hypermethylation, MESC hypomethylation progresses significantly from primary to metastatic cancer and defines a poor prognostic signature in four different gynaecological cancers. Finally, we associate expression of TET enzymes, which are involved in active DNA demethylation, to MESC hypomethylation in cancer. These findings have major implications for cancer and embryonic stem cell biology and establish the importance of systemic DNA hypomethylation for predicting prognosis in a wide range of different cancers.

Discrepancy in the previously reported values is attributed to the interaction of graphene with the substrate. Bilayer balloons (intentionally pressurized membranes) have been used to avoid the effect of the substrate and to study the dependence of strain on the interlayer interactions.

[pressure, trial, ulcer, support, surface, study, size, treatment, analysis, result]

Support surfaces for treating pressure ulcers.
BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers are treated by reducing pressure on the areas of damaged skin. Special support surfaces (including beds, mattresses and cushions) designed to redistribute pressure, are widely used as treatments. The relative effects of different support surfaces are unclear. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of pressure-relieving support surfaces in the treatment of pressure ulcers. SEARCH METHODS: We searched: The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 15 July 2011); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 3); Ovid MEDLINE (2007 to July Week 1 2011); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, July 14, 2011); Ovid EMBASE (2007 to 2011 Week 27); EBSCO CINAHL (2007 to 14 July 2011). The reference sections of included studies were also searched. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs), that assessed the effects of support surfaces for treating pressure ulcers, in any patient group or setting, that reported an objective measure of wound healing. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction and assessment of risk of bias were performed independently by two review authors. Trials with similar patients, comparisons and outcomes were considered for pooled analysis. Where pooling was inappropriate the results of the trials were reported narratively. Where possible, the risk ratio or mean difference was calculated for the results of individual studies. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 18 trials of support surfaces for pressure ulcer treatment, involving 1309 participants with samples sizes that ranged from 14 to 160. Of three trials comparing air-fluidized devices with conventional therapy, two reported significant reductions in pressure ulcer size associated with air-fluidized devices. Due to lack of reported variance data we could not replicate the analyses. In relation to three of the trials that reported significant reductions in pressure ulcer size favouring low air loss devices compared with foam alternatives, we found no significant differences. A small trial found that sheepskin placed under the legs significantly reduced redness and similarly a small subgroup analysis favoured a profiling bed compared with a standard bed in terms of the healing of existing grade 1 pressure ulcers. Poor reporting, clinical heterogeneity, lack of variance data and methodological limitations in the eligible trials meant that no pooled comparisons were undertaken. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no conclusive evidence about the superiority of any support surface for the treatment of existing pressure ulcers. Methodological issues included variations in outcomes measured, sample sizes and comparison groups. Many studies had small sample sizes and often there was inadequate description of the intervention, standard care and co-interventions. Individual study results were often inadequately reported, with failure to report variance data common, thus hindering the calculation of mean differences. Some studies did not report P values when reporting on differences in outcomes. In addition, the age of some trials (some being 20 years old), means that other technologies may have superseded those investigated.Further and rigorous studies are required to address these concerns and to improve the evidence base before firm conclusions can be drawn about the most effective support surfaces to treat pressure ulcers.

[teacher, tool, system, learner, choice, process]

It is mediation, not the medium that matters
At a time when teachers have access to a very broad range of technologies for use in their classrooms, it is the choices that teachers make and the way that these choices are deployed and understood that matter most for the outcomes of learners. Introducing a new technology into a classroom involves a number of actions on the part of the teacher, including an assessment of the needs of the learners; a desire to keep the course up-to-date and reflect current industry practice; a decision about the value of a new tool and its final choice; a curriculum that introduces and develops the key issues and skills for using the tool; an on-going dialogue about the assessment process; a set of informed pedagogical processes; and an engagement with other actors within the institution who set up and administer the tool. This is a very complex activity system and if the introduction of this new tool is to be successful, then the teacher needs to expect that there are going to be regular changes to keep the system working effectively and for the learners to keep buying into the process. This paper will explore this system through the case study of a teacher educator making use of WordPress as a Content Management System in a web design course aimed at language and other teachers on an MA module at the University of Manchester.

[component, composition, model, software, concurrency]

A Software Component Model with Concurrency
Component-Based Software Development (CBSD) represents a paradigm shift   in software engineering, where the focus is on building systems out of   pre-developed components. In CBSD, components developers are different from   component users, where the former concentrate on building reusable   components, whereas the latter concentrate on building customised systems   out of components.   The different roles in component development give rise to the idealised   component life cycle which consists of the design, the deployment and the   run-time phases. Ideally, component composition should occur in both design   and deployment phases and it should be supported by a proper composition   theory.   Concurrency is an important issue in software engineering and in   theoretical computer science. Decades of research have been devoted in   finding efficient ways of discovering common concurrency errors, like   deadlock, in abstract mathematical models and in software.   Existing software component models do not address composition and   concurrency completely. In general, component models support composition in   either design or deployment phase but not in both. Regarding concurrency,   the support provided varies, ranging from complete formal models to leaving   the concurrency aspect undefined and dependant on the implementation. More   importantly, not all component models support both passive and active   components.   In this thesis we define a software component model that supports   composition of active and passive components using explicit composition   operators, in both design and deployment phases of the idealised component   life cycle. We also show that our composition connectors are control   patterns and we define their composition. This means that composite   connectors are composed out of simpler ones. This allows for the   hierarchical construction of complex control structures that can be used in   further connector and component compositions. Connector composition   constitutes a unique feature of our model.

Reduction of colonic motility by intravenous nicardipine in irritable bowel syndrome.
The effect of nicardipine, a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, on postprandial colonic motility was assessed in 10 patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Each patient was studied twice receiving intravenously either N saline or nicardipine after a 1000 calorie meal. In the control study there was a significant (p less than 0.01) postprandial increase in the contractile activity of the colon, reaching a peak at approximately 20 minutes. Intravenous nicardipine completely abolished the colonic response, with a significant reduction in the number (p less than 0.005) and amplitude (p less than 0.005) of contractions and of the motility index (p less than 0.025). These results support the need for further studies to evaluate the therapeutic role of nicardipine in the irritable bowel syndrome.

Development of a simulation model for the SuperNEMO tracker module
SuperNEMO is an upcoming double-beta decay experiment designed to search for the hypothetical process of neutrinoless double-beta decay. It is composed of a double-beta emitting isotope surrounded by a tracking volume. This tracking volume is in turn composed of an array of drift tubes operating in the Geiger mode. To provide an accurate simulation of the experiment, it is important to understand the response of the drift tubes. In this study, the response of both the anode and cathode are considered. Two simulation models, called the timemap model and the two-dimensional fit model, have been developed to simulate the anode response. The timemap model is shown to be in good agreement with simulations made using the drift tube simulation software Garfield. The simulation models have been implemented as C++ packages that can be used as part of the SuperNEMO simulation. Both the models have been compared to data taken using a prototype module with 18 drift tubes.

Dynamics of confined plumes during short and ultrashort pulsed laser ablation of graphite
<p>The optical emission from electronically excited C species in the ablation plume following the short (ns) and ultrashort (fs) UV pulsed laser ablation of graphite is studied. Wavelength, time and spatially resolved imaging of the plume, in background pressures of inert gases such as argon and helium, is performed. Analysis of images of optical emission from C+* ions and C-2(*) radicals, yielded estimates of the apparent velocity of emitting species, which appear to arise both from the initial ablation event and, in the presence of background gas, mainly from impact excitation. At elevated background pressures of argon (P-Ar), the formation and propagation of a shock wave is observed for ns pulses, whereas for fs pulses, the propagation of two shock waves is observed. During fs ablation, the first shock wave we associate with an initial burst of highly energetic/electronically excited ablated components, indicative of an enhanced fraction of non-thermal ejection mechanisms when compared with ns ablation. The second shock wave we associate with subsequently ejected, slower moving, material. Concurrent with the plume dynamics investigations, nanostructured amorphous carbon materials were deposited by collecting the ablated material. By varying P-Ar from 5 to 340 mTorr, the film morphology could be changed from mirror smooth, through a rough nanostructured phase and, at the highest background pressures for ns pulses, to a low density cluster-assembled material. The evident correlations between the film structure, the mean velocities of the emitting C species, and their respective dependences upon P-Ar are discussed for both pulse durations. In addition, we comment on the effect of observed initial plume dynamics on the subsequent C cluster formation in the expanding plume.</p>

Characterization of the Enzyme CbiH60 Involved in Anaerobic Ring Contraction of the Cobalamin (Vitamin B12) Biosynthetic Pathway.
The anaerobic pathway for the biosynthesis of cobalamin (vitamin B(12)) has remained poorly characterized because of the sensitivity of the pathway intermediates to oxygen and the low activity of enzymes. One of the major bottlenecks in the anaerobic pathway is the ring contraction step, which has not been observed previously with a purified enzyme system. The Gram-positive aerobic bacterium Bacillus megaterium has a complete anaerobic pathway that contains an unusual ring contraction enzyme, CbiH(60), that harbors a C-terminal extension with sequence similarity to the nitrite/sulfite reductase family. To improve solubility, the enzyme was homologously produced in the host B. megaterium DSM319. CbiH(60) was characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance and shown to contain a 4Fe-4S center. Assays with purified recombinant CbiH(60) demonstrate that the enzyme converts both cobalt-precorrin-3 and cobalt factor III into the ring-contracted product cobalt-precorrin-4 in high yields, with the latter transformation dependent upon DTT and an intact Fe-S center. Furthermore, the ring contraction process was shown not to involve a change in the oxidation state of the central cobalt ion of the macrocycle.

An update on the long-term safety experience of ustekinumab: results from the psoriasis clinical development program with up to four years of follow-up.
BACKGROUND: The efficacy and safety profile of ustekinumab with up to three years of exposure suggested a favorable benefit-risk profile in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety of ustekinumab in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis treated for up to four years. METHODS: Safety data were pooled across four Phase II/III randomized controlled trials. Rates over time and cumulative rates of adverse events (AEs), AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, serious adverse events (SAEs), serious infections, malignancies, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (i.e., cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction MI, or stroke as adjudicated by an independent panel of academic cardiologists) were evaluated. Observed rates of AEs of interest were compared with those expected in the general (malignancies, MI, and stroke) and psoriasis (serious infections, MI, and stroke) populations. RESULTS: Overall, 3,117 patients were followed for up to four years (6,791 patient-years). Rates of AEs, AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, and SAEs remained stable over time, whereas cumulative rates were generally comparable between patients who received 45 mg and 90 mg of ustekinumab. The rates of AEs of interest also remained stable over time, and cumulative rates per 100 patient-years were 0.80 and 1.32 (serious infections), 0.70 and 0.53 (nonmelanoma skin cancer), 0.63 and 0.61 (other malignancies), and 0.56 and 0.46 (MACE) in patients treated with 45 mg and 90 mg, respectively. Rates of AEs of interest were consistent with those in the general and psoriasis populations. CONCLUSION: The safety profile of long-term ustekinumab treatment with up to four years of continuous use remains consistent with previous reports, with no evidence of cumulative toxicity.

Fungal diseases still play a major role in morbidity and mortality in patients with haematological malignancies, including those undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Although Aspergillus and other filamentous fungal diseases remain a major concern, Candida infections are still a major cause of mortality. This part of the ESCMID guidelines focuses on this patient population and reviews pertaining to prophylaxis, empirical/pre-emptive and targeted therapy of Candida diseases. Anti-Candida prophylaxis is only recommended for patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The authors recognize that the recommendations would have most likely been different if the purpose would have been prevention of all fungal infections (e.g. aspergillosis). In targeted treatment of candidaemia, recommendations for treatment are available for all echinocandins, that is anidulafungin (AI), caspofungin (AI) and micafungin (AI), although a warning for resistance is expressed. Liposomal amphotericin B received a BI recommendation due to higher number of reported adverse events in the trials. Amphotericin B deoxycholate should not be used (DII); and fluconazole was rated CI because of a change in epidemiology in some areas in Europe. Removal of central venous catheters is recommended during candidaemia but if catheter retention is a clinical necessity, treatment with an echinocandin is an option (CII(t) ). In chronic disseminated candidiasis therapy, recommendations are liposomal amphotericin B for 8 weeks (AIII), fluconazole for >3 months or other azoles (BIII). Granulocyte transfusions are only an option in desperate cases of patients with Candida disease and neutropenia (CIII).

RECENT FINDINGS: Since 2008 investigators have identified many common genetic variants that confer disease risk through single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping studies; the list of variants will no doubt continue to expand at a rapid rate as genotyping technologies evolve and case-control sample collections continue to grow. In aggregate, these variants implicate pathways leading to NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) activation, the interluekin-2 signaling pathway, and T-cell activation. SUMMARY: Although the effect of any individual variant is modest and even in aggregate considerably less than that of the major histocompatability complex, discovery of recent risk variants suggests immunological processes that are involved in disease pathogenesis.

Influence of 9p21.3 Genetic Variants on Clinical and Angiographic Outcomes in Early-Onset Myocardial Infarction
OBJECTIVES:
The purpose of this study was to test whether the 9p21.3 variant rs1333040 influences the occurrence of new cardiovascular events and coronary atherosclerosis progression after early-onset myocardial infarction.

BACKGROUND:
9p21.3 genetic variants are associated with ischemic heart disease, but it is not known whether they influence prognosis after an acute coronary event.

METHODS:
Within the Italian Genetic Study of Early-onset Myocardial Infarction, we genotyped rs1333040 in 1,508 patients hospitalized for a first myocardial infarction before the age of 45 years who underwent coronary angiography without index event coronary revascularization. They were followed up for major cardiovascular events and angiographic coronary atherosclerosis progression.

RESULTS:
Over 16,599 person-years, there were 683 cardiovascular events and 492 primary endpoints: 77 cardiovascular deaths, 223 reoccurrences of myocardial infarction, and 383 coronary artery revascularizations. The rs1333040 genotype had a significant influence (p = 0.01) on the primary endpoint, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.19 (95% confidence interval CI: 1.08 to 1.37) for heterozygous carriers and 1.41 (95% CI: 1.06 to 1.87) for homozygous carriers. Analysis of the individual components of the primary endpoints provided no significant evidence that the rs1333040 genotype influenced the hazard of cardiovascular death (p = 0.24) or the reoccurrence of myocardial infarction (p = 0.57), but did provide significant evidence that it influenced on the hazard of coronary revascularization, with adjusted heterozygous and homozygous ratios of 1.38 (95% CI: 1.17 to 1.63) and 1.90 (95% CI: 1.36 to 2.65) (p = 0.00015), respectively. It also significantly influenced the angiographic endpoint of coronary atherosclerosis progression (p = 0.002).

CONCLUSIONS:
In early-onset myocardial infarction, the 9p21.3 variant rs1333040 affects the progression of coronary atherosclerosis and the probability of coronary artery revascularization during long-term follow-up.

[nod2, wound, prr, cutaneous]

Nod2 deficiency impairs inflammatory and epithelial aspects of the cutaneous wound healing response.
Infection is a significant causative factor in human chronic wounds which fail to heal. Complex innate host response mechanisms have evolved whereby potentially harmful pathogens are recognised by multiple host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), yet understanding of PRR function, or dysfunction, in the context of chronic wounds remains limited. NOD2, a cytoplasmic PRR has been strongly implicated in chronic inflammation of the gut, where loss-of-function mutations have been linked to Crohn's disease; however, cutaneous Nod2 function remains poorly characterised. Here we demonstrate an important role for Nod2 in murine skin wound healing. Cutaneous Nod2 is induced in key wound cell types in response to injury. In the absence of Nod2, mice display a substantial delay in acute wound repair associated with epithelial and inflammatory changes. Specifically, Nod2 null mice display altered epidermal migration and proliferation, an initial delay in neutrophil recruitment associated with decreased expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR2, and reduced numbers of alternatively activated macrophages (Ym1(+) cells). Somewhat surprisingly, these Nod2 null phenotypes were associated with little or no expression change in other PRR's, even though compensatory mechanisms have been shown to exist. In this study we show that healing in TLR2 null mice was essentially normal. These findings reveal a novel intrinsic role for Nod2 in cutaneous wound repair in addition to its role in recognising invading pathogens.

Performance of a Downconverter Test-electronics with MTCA-based Digitizers for Beam Position Monitoring in 3.9 GHz Accelerating Cavities
Beam-excited higher order modes (HOM) in 3.9GHz accelerating cavities are planned to be used for beam position monitoring at the European XFEL. The selected HOMs are located around 5440MHz, with a bandwidth of 100MHz and 9060MHz, with a bandwidth of 50MHz. A downconverter electronics, built for tests at FLASH, converts the HOMs to an intermediate frequency of 70MHz.  The MTCA (Micro Telecommunications Computing Architecture) standard will be used for the XFEL. Thus it is important to have a performance study of the downconverter test-electronics using the MTCA digitizer card SIS8300. In the digitizer the IF frequency of 70MHz is undersampled with a clock frequency of 108MS/s. The paper presents the performance of the digitizer together with the test-electronics. A comparison with a 216MS/s VME (Versa Module Eurocard) digitizer is made.

The Government of Wales Act 2006: Welsh devolution still a process and not an event?
<p>Following the Assembly Elections in May 2007 Wales moved into a new area in its devolutionary settlement with a change of government and new legislation - the Government of Wales Act 2006. The Act is designed to revise fundamentally the Government of Wales Act 1998. Critics at the time predicted that executive devolution would be unlikely to be stable and would lead to "catch up" devolution with more privileged nations such as Scotland. Hence the second phase of Welsh devolution in which a Westminster model of Government is introduced as well as enhanced legislative powers for the National Assembly for Wales, including powers for the Assembly to be given legislative competence by Order in Council to make law in certain of the devolved fields, as an interim stage towards achieving full legislative devolution following a referendum. This paper argues that the Government of Wales Act 2006 has not conclusively settled the constitutional issues of asymmetrical devolution, such as the distribution of power between London and Cardiff; the role of the Secretary of State; the clarity and transparency of Welsh governance; and the question of how long these interim arrangements will last before Wales gains legislative devolution.</p>

[length, telomere, sle, patient]

Telomere length is shortened in SLE patients.
OBJECTIVES: Patients with SLE have premature mortality compared to the general population suggesting a phenotype of premature senescence in SLE. Telomere length (TL) can be used to assess overall biological ageing. We hypothesise that patients with SLE have reduced TL. METHODS: TL was measured cross-sectionally in whole blood using real time quantitative PCR in SLE and age-matched healthy females. SLE-related and cardiovascular risk factors were assessed. RESULTS: We compared TL in 63 SLE patients and controls with a median (IQR) age of 50.8 (37, 59) and 49.9 (32, 60) years respectively. The median (IQR) relative telomere length in SLE patients was 0.97 (0.47, 1.57) compared to 1.53 (0.82, 2.29) in controls (p=0.0008). We extended our cohort to measure telomere length in 164 SLE patients. Shorter telomere length was associated with Ro antibodies (coefficient -0.36 SE (0.16), p = 0.023) and longer telomere length was associated with steroid therapy (0.29 (0.14), p<0.046). We also note an association of longer telomere length with increasing BMI (0.07 (0.01), p<0.0001) and tobacco smoking (0.64 (0.26), p = 0.016) as well as with the presence of carotid plaque (β 0.203 (0.177), p=0.032). CONCLUSIONS: Telomere length is shortened in SLE patients compared to controls and does not appear to be a reflection of disease activity or immune cell turnover. Subsets of patients such as those positive for Ro antibodies may be particularly susceptible to premature biological ageing. The predictive value of telomere length as a biomarker of future risk of damage/mortality requires longitudinal evaluation. © 2013 American College of Rheumatology.

The karyomastigont as an evolutionary seme
The problem of eukaryogenesis—the evolutionary mechanism whereby eukaryotic cells evolved from prokaryotes—remains one of the great unsolved mysteries of cell biology, possibly due to the reductionist tendency of most scientists to work only within their subdisciplines. Communication between biologists who conduct research on the nucleus and those working on the cytoskeleton or endomembrane system are sometimes wanting, and yet, all of these quintessentially eukaryotic elements of the cell are interdependent, and are physically associated in many protists as the karyomastigont organellar system: nucleus, one or more basal bodies and flagella, nuclear connector, and Golgi apparatus. Here we suggest a more holistic view of the karyomastigont as not simply an organellar system, but an evolutionary seme, the archaic state of the eukaryotic cell. We also present a scheme whereby the karyomastigont may have dissociated, giving rise in more derived cells to one or more free nuclei and discrete flagellar apparati (akaryomastigonts).Author Posting. © University of Chicago Press, 2012.

[design, architecture, system]

Overview of the SpiNNaker System Architecture
SpiNNaker (a contraction of Spiking Neural Network Architecture) is a million-core computing engine whose flagship goal is to be able to simulate the behaviour of aggregates of up to a billion neurons in real time. It consists of an array of ARM9 cores, communicating via packets carried by a custom interconnect fabric. The packets are small (40 or 72 bits), and their transmission is brokered entirely by hardware, giving the overall engine an extremely high bisection bandwidth of over 5 billion packets/s. Three of the principle axioms of parallel machine design - memory coherence, synchronicity and determinism - have been discarded in the design without, surprisingly, compromising the ability to perform meaningful computations. A further attribute of the system is the acknowledgement, from the initial design stages, that the sheer size of the implementation will make component failures an inevitable aspect of day-to-day operation, and fault detection and recovery mechanisms have been built into the system at many levels of abstraction. This paper describes the architecture of the machine and outlines the underlying design philosophy; software and applications are to be described in detail elsewhere, and only introduced in passing here as necessary to illuminate the description.

Prospective, multi-center study of the effectiveness of orthodontic/orthognathic surgery care in the United Kingdom.
INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of orthodontic/orthognathic surgical care provided in the North West region of England. It was an observational, prospective cohort study at 13 maxillofacial clinics in the United Kingdom. METHODS: The 131 patients comprised 47 males (35.9%) and 84 females (64.1%), with an average age of 22.6 years. They received orthodontic/orthognathic treatment according to the normal protocols of the operators. They were then followed until all orthodontic treatment was completed. Final skeletal pattern, final peer assessment rating score, number of attendances, and duration of treatment were recorded. RESULTS: At the end of the 5-year study, 94 patients had completed treatment, and 71 had complete data. Data analysis showed that, overall, the treatments provided were effective in terms of skeletal and dental occlusal outcomes; the final mean peer assessment rating score was 10.58. However, treatment duration was longer than commonly expected, with a mean length of 32.8 months (SD,11.3). The outcome of treatment was influenced by only pretreatment skeletal discrepancy. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective investigation showed that orthodontic/orthognathic surgical care was effective. The outcome of treatment was influenced only by the severity of the pretreatment skeletal discrepancy.

Haplotype analysis of the 185delAG BRCA1 mutation in ethnically diverse populations.
The 185delAG* BRCA1 mutation is encountered primarily in Jewish Ashkenazi and Iraqi individuals, and sporadically in non-Jews. Previous studies estimated that this is a founder mutation in Jewish mutation carriers that arose before the dispersion of Jews in the Diaspora ∼2500 years ago. The aim of this study was to assess the haplotype in ethnically diverse 185delAG* BRCA1 mutation carriers, and to estimate the age at which the mutation arose. Ethnically diverse Jewish and non-Jewish 185delAG*BRCA1 mutation carriers and their relatives were genotyped using 15 microsatellite markers and three SNPs spanning 12.5 MB, encompassing the BRCA1 gene locus. Estimation of mutation age was based on a subset of 11 markers spanning a region of ∼5 MB, using a previously developed algorithm applying the maximum likelihood method. Overall, 188 participants (154 carriers and 34 noncarriers) from 115 families were included: Ashkenazi, Iraq, Kuchin-Indians, Syria, Turkey, Iran, Tunisia, Bulgaria, non-Jewish English, non-Jewish Malaysian, and Hispanics. Haplotype analysis indicated that the 185delAG mutation arose 750-1500 years ago. In Ashkenazim, it is a founder mutation that arose 61 generations ago, and with a small group of founder mutations was introduced into the Hispanic population (conversos) ∼650 years ago, and into the Iraqi-Jewish community ∼450 years ago. The 185delAG mutation in the non-Jewish populations in Malaysia and the UK arose at least twice independently. We conclude that the 185delAG* BRCA1 mutation resides on a common haplotype among Ashkenazi Jews, and arose about 61 generations ago and arose independently at least twice in non-Jews.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 4 July 2012; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2012.124.

[cell, hypoxic, abt-737, apoptosis, tumor, mcl-1, hypoxium]

Hypoxic human cancer cells are sensitized to BH-3 mimetic–induced apoptosis via downregulation of the Bcl-2 protein Mcl-1.
Solid tumors contain hypoxic regions in which cancer cells are often resistant to chemotherapy-induced apoptotic cell death. Therapeutic strategies that specifically target hypoxic cells and promote apoptosis are particularly appealing, as few normal tissues experience hypoxia. We have found that the compound ABT-737, a Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH-3) mimetic, promotes apoptotic cell death in human colorectal carcinoma and small cell lung cancer cell lines exposed to hypoxia. This hypoxic induction of apoptosis was mediated through downregulation of myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1), a Bcl-2 family protein that serves as a biomarker for ABT-737 resistance. Downregulation of Mcl-1 in hypoxia was independent of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) activity and was consistent with decreased global protein translation. In addition, ABT-737 induced apoptosis deep within tumor spheroids, consistent with an optimal hypoxic oxygen tension being necessary to promote ABT-737–induced cell death. Tumor xenografts in ABT-737–treated mice also displayed significantly more apoptotic cells within hypoxic regions relative to normoxic regions. Synergies between ABT-737 and other cytotoxic drugs were maintained in hypoxia, suggesting that this drug may be useful in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. Taken together, these findings suggest that Mcl-1–sparing BH-3 mimetics may induce apoptosis in hypoxic tumor cells that are resistant to other chemotherapeutic agents and may have a role in combinatorial chemotherapeutic regimens for treatment of solid tumors.

[skin, tj, human, expression, uvr, cld-1, ageing, protein, reduction, function]

CHARACTERISATION OF EPIDERMAL TIGHT JUNCTION PROTEINS IN AGEING
The epidermal tight junction (TJ) plays an important role as a barrier which protects the skin against dehydration and infection. Skin barrier function is known to decline with increasing age (Rabe et al., 2006). Human skin is subject to intrinsic (i.e. chronological) ageing and extrinsic (environmentally-induced) ageing. However, the role of TJs in the ageing process is still unknown. Therefore, in this study, using quantitative immunofluorescent staining TJ protein expression was investigated in intrinsically aged compared to young human skin. Since ultraviolet radiation (UVR) from sunlight is considered the major environmental insult to human skin, TJ proteins were also investigated in photoaged compared to photoprotected human skin, and in skin exposed to a single acute dose of UVR.In aged vs young skin, there was no significant difference either in the expression levels or localisation of TJ proteins.However, significant reduction in claudin-1 (cld-1) and increases in cld-7 and -12 expressions were demonstrated in chronically photoaged human skin suggesting differential regulation of clds in response to photoexposure. By contrast in acutely irradiated human skin, only a reduction in cld-1 expression was observed 24h after a single UVB dose. Moreover, in both chronic and acute UVR exposed human skin, cld-1 was most significantly reduced in the basal layer of the epidermis suggesting that the differentiation state of keratinocytes might be important in their response to UVR.To investigate these effects further, a normal human epidermal keratinocyte (NHEK) cell culture model was employed. A reduction in cld-1 expression and an increase in cld-4 were demonstrated in undifferentiated NHEK cells irradiated with sub lethal doses of UVR. Interestingly, no changes were observed in TJ protein expression in irradiated differentiated keratinocytes. However, when TJ function was measured in these cells using transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) as a marker of TJ function, UVR induced a significant reduction in TEER. This coincided with an alteration in the organisation of cld-1 in irradiated differentiated keratinocytes.These data demonstrate that TJ protein expression is modulated by acute and chronic exposure to UVR. These observations may explain, at least in part, the decline in skin barrier function observed in response to UVR.

Assessing the properties of the WHOQOL-Pain: quality of life of chronic low back pain patients during treatment.
OBJECTIVES: Assessing subjective, patient-reported outcomes such as quality of life (QoL) is essential to health care research. This study aimed to assess the properties of a QoL measure relating to pain and discomfort: the WHOQOL-Pain. METHOD: Chronic low back pain patients (n=133) completed the WHOQOL-Pain, SF-12, and short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire before treatment started and again 2-4 weeks later. Of these, 76 received a lumbar epidural steroid injection, and 57 were waiting to receive treatment. RESULTS: Overall, there was no significant difference in effect of either epidural injections or no treatment on bringing about an improvement to QoL overtime. Moderate effect sizes were found for 5 facets including pain relief and uncertainty. Small effect sizes were found for 7 facets including vulnerability, fear and worry, anger and frustration. Larger effect sizes were found for those reporting the most improvement in pain. The waiting group reported no significant changes to QoL but small changes for uncertainty. Three of the four new facets were sensitive to change and test-retest reliability (stability) was confirmed in three. DISCUSSION: Although this study was not designed to test treatment effectiveness, the WHOQOL-Pain enables patients to report changes to important aspects of QoL during many diverse interventions for relieving pain.

Drug repositioning for Alzheimer's disease.
Existing drugs for Alzheimer's disease provide symptomatic benefit for up to 12 months, but there are no approved disease-modifying therapies. Given the recent failures of various novel disease-modifying therapies in clinical trials, a complementary strategy based on repositioning drugs that are approved for other indications could be attractive. Indeed, a substantial body of preclinical work indicates that several classes of such drugs have potentially beneficial effects on Alzheimer's-like brain pathology, and for some drugs the evidence is also supported by epidemiological data or preliminary clinical trials. Here, we present a formal consensus evaluation of these opportunities, based on a systematic review of published literature. We highlight several compounds for which sufficient evidence is available to encourage further investigation to clarify an optimal dose and consider progression to clinical trials in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

[form, anthropomorphic, design, robot, interaction, evaluation, humanness]

The Usage and Evaluation of Anthropomorphic Form in Robot Design
<p>There are numerous examples illustrating the application of human shape in everyday products. Usage of anthropomorphic form has long been a basic design strategy, particularly in the design of intelligent service robots. As such, it is desirable to use anthropomorphic form not only in aesthetic design but also in interaction design. Proceeding from how anthropomorphism in various domains has taken effect on human perception, we assumed that anthropomorphic form used in appearance and interaction design of robots enriches the   explanation of its function and creates familiarity with robots. From many cases we have found, misused anthropomorphic form lead to user disappointment or negative impressions on the robot. In order to effectively use anthropomorphic form, it is necessary to measure the similarity of an artifact to the human form (humanness), and then evaluate whether the usage of anthropomorphic form fits the artifact. The goal of this study is to propose a general evaluation framework of anthropomorphic form for robot design. We suggest three major steps for framing the evaluation: 'measuring anthropomorphic form in appearance', 'measuring anthropomorphic form in Human-Robot Interaction', and 'evaluation of accordance of two former measurements'. This evaluation process will endow a robot an amount of humanness in their appearance equivalent to an amount of humanness in interaction ability, and then ultimately facilitate user satisfaction.

Perturbation of cell cycle expression in keloid fibroblast.
The pathogenesis of keloid formation is poorly understood. The fibroblasts in keloid patients continue to multiply even after initial wound repair and are characterized by a persistent dermal fibroproliferative reaction and excessive extracellular matrix production. Most studies concentrate on the type of collagen produced within keloids and the cytokines that dominate the disease. There have been considerably fewer studies in the expression of messenger RNA level in key cell cycle genes of the keloid fibroblast. The aim of this study was to measure the messenger RNA expression of the key regulators of cell cycle, cell cycle cyclins, and cyclin-dependent kinases, and their inhibitors.

Intercellular transfer of cell-surface proteins is common and can affect many stages of an immune response.
Cells can extend the limits of their transcriptome by using proteins captured from other cells. Through an exchange of specific proteins, tools and information can be shared to establish integrated communities of cells that are better able to coordinate stages of an immune response. Transferred proteins can also contribute to pathology by allowing, for example, infection of cell types not otherwise infected. Here, I present the case for considering the intercellular transfer of cell-surface proteins between immune cells as commonplace and important.

Constructing a distributed AUV network for underwater plume-tracking operations
In recent years, there has been significant concern about the impacts of offshore oil spill plumes and harmful algal blooms on the coastal ocean environment and biology, as well as on the human populations adjacent to these coastal regions. Thus, it has become increasingly important to determine the 3D extent of these ocean features (“plumes”) and how they evolve over time. The ocean environment is largely inaccessible to sensing directly by humans, motivating the need for robots to intelligently sense the ocean for us. In this paper, we propose the use of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) network to track and predict plume shape and motion, discussing solutions to the challenges of spatiotemporal data aliasing (coverage versus resolution), underwater communication, AUV autonomy, data fusion, and coordination of multiple AUVs. A plume simulation is also developed here as the first step toward implementing behaviors for autonomous, adaptive plume tracking with AUVs, modeling a plume as a sum of Fourier orders and examining the resulting errors. This is then extended to include plume forecasting based on time variations, and future improvements and implementation are discussed.© The Author(s),  2012.

Basal acid output was found to be significantly elevated in patients with Crohn's disease who had had surgery (P less than 0.01). This elevation was related to ileal resection rather than ileal disease. There was no difference in the maximal or peak acid outputs between any of the groups.

This dissertation uses a crystal plasticity scheme in the finite element framework (CPFEM) to study deformation mechanisms in alumina, aluminium and stainless steel – all polycrystalline. Four research cases in this dissertation have been presented in the form of manuscripts for publication. When possible, modelling predictions have been compared against various experimental techniques such as Diffraction Contrast Tomography (DCT), Neutron Diffraction (ND) and Electron Back Scatter Diffraction (EBSD). After an introduction (Chapter 1) and a literature review (Chapter 2) on plastic deformation and modelling techniques, the methodology and results are presented and discussed (Chapters 3 and 4). Measurements of elastic strains for individual grain families (ND) and local rotations (DCT and EBSD) are compared against corresponding predictions by the model following different loading modes. Each study reveals different degrees of agreement between predictions and measurements. The individual conclusions to each study are presented in Chapter 4. Some overall conclusions and suggestions for further work are presented in Chapter 5.

[cough, cancer, lung, patient, management, symptom]

Understanding cough and its management in lung cancer.
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article summarizes the current understanding of cough in lung cancer, strategies for its management and highlights areas where further research is warranted.Cough is common, severe and distressing for many lung cancer patients. Currently few effective cough interventions exist for lung cancer patients. This review proposes some of the mechanisms that may underlie cough in lung cancer and presents the existing data on antitussive therapy in cancer patients. A greater focus on the cough mechanisms may enable effective antitussives to be developed in the future for lung cancer patients. A brief overview of the validated cough assessment tools is provided. The use of such tools will enable robust clinical endpoints to be determined for future cough intervention studies. A 'cough treatment pyramid' is presented to provide a pragmatic approach to the management of cough in lung cancer patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite the small number of publications on cough in lung cancer, some recent research has characterized cough for the first time in lung cancer patients. Its impact on quality of life domains such as psychological, social and physical is significant. The lung cancer symptom cluster of cough, breathlessness and fatigue has also been described. A recently developed cough severity assessment tool has provided researchers with a short well validated seven-item questionnaire to determine this important cough characteristic. In addition, a Cochrane Database Systematic Review on Interventions for Cough in Cancer has also been published. These studies are all described in the present review. Understanding the impact of a symptom such as cough, the assessment of cough and its potential underlying mechanisms is crucial if we are to manage this symptom effectively. SUMMARY: Current cough management in lung cancer patients is lagging behind the management of other cancer symptoms. There is now an increasing need to diagnose and treat cough more effectively, as lung cancer patients are living longer with chronic symptoms such as cough.

[hearing, loss, patient, datum]

Hearing loss in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis II: data from HOS - the Hunter Outcome Survey.
BACKGROUND: Subjectively reported hearing loss is a common feature of mucopolysaccharidosis II (MPS II, Hunter syndrome). This study provides an epidemiological description of hearing loss and other otolaryngological manifestations reported by patients registered in the Hunter Outcome Survey (HOS), an international registry of patients with MPS II. METHODS: Data about ear signs and symptoms were available for 554 of the 605 patients alive at HOS entry. The degree of hearing loss for 162 pure-tone audiograms (PTAs) from 83 patients was classified by independent interpreters using both the age-specific International Institute of Standardization (ISO) 7029 standard and the age-independent World Health Organization (WHO) clinical guidelines. A linear regression analysis using cross-sectional data was conducted to investigate the relationship between hearing loss and age. RESULTS: The most prevalent otolaryngological manifestations and interventions reported were otitis (either acute otitis media or chronic otitis media 72%), hearing loss (67%), insertion of ventilation tubes (50%), adenoidectomy (47%), and hearing aids (41%). According to the ISO standard, only one patient out of the 83 with audiogram data in HOS had normal hearing in both ears at all time points. According to the WHO classification, 16% had normal hearing; hearing loss was mild in 24%, moderate in 31%, severe in 22%, and profound in 7%. In the linear regression analysis, the hearing threshold in the cohort increased with age at an estimated rate of approximately 1 dB per year. CONCLUSIONS: Hearing impairment is common in MPS II. Early otolaryngological evaluation and intervention is recommended.

[il-2, methylation, hospital, asthma, child, admission, site1, exacerbation, age]

Methylation of IL-2 promoter at birth alters the risk of asthma exacerbations during childhood.
BACKGROUND: Epigenetic modifications may have a role in asthma susceptibility. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether epigenetic modification at birth of a CpG site necessary for the regulation of IL-2 transcription (IL-2 Site1) is associated with the development of asthma during childhood. METHODS: Methylation of IL-2 Site1 was assessed in cord blood from 303 children (225 with atopic mothers); as controls, we measured methylation of a site not important in the transcription of IL-2 (IL-2 Site7) and methylation of the LINE-1 repetitive element. Children were followed to the age of 8 years. Information on severe asthma exacerbations and hospital admissions was collected from child's primary care medical record. To account for potential confounding by bronchiolitis, we used exacerbations/hospitalizations after age 1 year as primary outcomes. RESULTS: There were 49 severe exacerbations amongst 33 children, and 22 hospital admissions amongst 11 children. The risk of asthma exacerbation increased 1.07-fold (95% CI 1.01-1.14, P = 0.03) and the risk of hospital admission increased 1.12-fold (95% CI 1.04-1.20, P = 0.002) for each one per cent increase in IL-2 Site1 methylation. Children who were admitted to hospital at any time-point had significantly higher IL-2 Site1 methylation than children not admitted to hospital (P = 0.007). There was a significant interaction between age at exacerbation (P = 0.03) or hospital admission (P = 0.02) and methylation, with the effect of methylation increasing with increasing age. Methylation of the control IL-2 Site7 or LINE-1 was not a significant predictor of asthma exacerbations/hospital admission, and we found no association between IL-2 Site1 methylation and hospital admissions for other reasons (0.99 0.92-1.06). Cord blood mononuclear cell phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphoproliferative responses decreased significantly with increasing IL-2 Site1 methylation (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing methylation in cord blood of a functional CpG site in the IL-2 promoter is associated with increased likelihood of severe asthma exacerbations and hospital admissions for asthma/wheeze between ages of 2 and 8 years.

[humic, ph, sorption, acid, montmorillonite]

Sorption of humic acid and europium onto montmorillonite as a function of pH, ionic strength and metal ion concentration
In this work, the effect of pH and ionic strength was investigated in the ternary system of montmorillonite, humic acid and europium. The binary interactions of the metal ion and the humic acid with the montmorillonite have also been studied. The sorption of humic acid on montmorillonite is at a maximum (~95%) between pH 2 to 5. Above pH 5, the sorption starts decreasing. Increasing the pH increases the sorption of Eu3+ onto montmorillonite in the absence of humic acid. The behaviour in the binary Eu/montmorillonite is consistent with a surface complexation mechanism across the pH range. In the presence of humic acid, the Eu3+ behaviour is different. It shows a similar trend to that in the absence of humic acid in the range of pH from 2 to 5, but above pH 5 the amount sorbed decreases rapidly. Increasing HA concentration reduces Eu sorption. The sorption of HA and Eu3+ (in presence of HA) was also studied as a function of ionic strength. In both cases, the Kd value increases with increasing concentration of NaClO4 from 0.01 to 0.2 mol/l at pH 6. The presence of humic reduces Eu sorption in the ternary system, as would be expected for a competing ligand, but there is evidence from the data that Eu binds to sorbed humic in the ternary system, and that the sorbed humic has a higher affinity for the Eu than that left in the solution phase.

[cell, memory, lymph, infection, node]

Long-term persistence and reactivation of T cell memory in the lung of mice infected with respiratory syncytial virus.
In mice acutely infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), more than 20% of pulmonary CD8(+) T cells, but only 2-3% of CD8(+) T cells in the draining lymph node secreted interferon-gamma in response to a single peptide. Surprisingly, the percentage of virus-specific T cells in the lung remained at these high levels long after the acute infection. Pulmonary memory T cells were further studied in a sensitive adoptive transfer system, which allows visualizing polyclonal CD4(+) and CD8(+) virus-specific memory T cell responses. Fifty days after infection, persisting RSV-specific pulmonary T cells remained CD69(hi) CD62L(lo), but had returned to a resting memory state according to functional criteria. In the absence of neutralizing antibodies reinfection first induced cell division among virus-specific memory T cells 3 days after infection predominantly in the local lymph node. However, divided cells then rapidly accumulated in the lung without significantly increasing in the lymph node. These results suggest rapid export of reactivated cells from the lymph node to the target organ. Thus, although memory T cells can be maintained in the infected organ after a localized virus infection, amplification of a recall response appears to be most effective in organized lymphoid tissue.

Progress in the measurement of salinity and oxygen at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
Improvements in the measurement of salinity and dissolved
oxygen during the past few years at WHOI have increased the accuracy of
salinity observations to +/- 0.001 ppt and that of dissolved oxygen
determinations to +/- 0.04 ml/1. These improvements are attributable to
the careful maintenance of the sample collection and analysis
equipment, the construction of portable, sea going laboratories in
which the temperature is constant to +/- 1 degree C and the skillful
use of an Autosal 8400-A salinometer and a Metrohm Titroprocessor by
well trained technicians. An automated data logging system eliminates

Rituximab maintenance therapy after autologous stem-cell transplantation in patients with relapsed CD20(+) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: final analysis of the collaborative trial in relapsed aggressive lymphoma.
PURPOSE: The standard treatment for relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is salvage chemotherapy followed by high-dose therapy and autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT). The impact of maintenance rituximab after ASCT is not known. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 477 patients with CD20(+) DLBCL who were in their first relapse or refractory to initial therapy were randomly assigned to one of two salvage regimens. After three cycles of salvage chemotherapy, the responding patients received high-dose chemotherapy followed by ASCT. Then, 242 patients were randomly assigned to either rituximab every 2 months for 1 year or observation. RESULTS: After ASCT, 122 patients received rituximab, and 120 patients were observed only. The median follow-up time was 44 months. The 4-year event-free survival (EFS) rates after ASCT were 52% and 53% for the rituximab and observation groups, respectively (P = .7). Treatment with rituximab was associated with a 15% attributable risk of serious adverse events after day 100, with more deaths (six deaths v three deaths in the observation arm). Several factors affected EFS after ASCT (P < .05), including relapsed disease within 12 months (EFS: 46% v 56% for relapsed disease after 12 months), secondary age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (saaIPI) more than 1 (EFS: 37% v 61% for saaIPI < 1), and prior treatment with rituximab (EFS: 47% v 59% for no prior rituximab). A significant difference in EFS between women (63%) and men (46%) was also observed in the rituximab group. In the Cox model for maintenance, the saaIPI was a significant prognostic factor (P < .001), as was male sex (P = .01). CONCLUSION: In relapsed DLBCL, we observed no difference between the control group and the rituximab maintenance group and do not recommend rituximab after ASCT.

Whole transcriptome sequencing of the aging rat brain reveals dynamic RNA changes in the dark matter of the genome.
Brain aging frequently underlies cognitive decline and is a major risk factor for neurodegenerative conditions. The exact molecular mechanisms underlying brain aging, however, remain unknown. Whole transcriptome sequencing provides unparalleled depth and sensitivity in gene expression profiling. It also allows non-coding RNA and splice variant detection/comparison across phenotypes. Using RNA-seq to sequence the cerebral cortex transcriptome in 6-, 12- and 28-month-old rats, age-related changes were studied. Protein-coding genes related to MHC II presentation and serotonin biosynthesis were differentially expressed (DE) in aging. Relative to protein-coding genes, more non-coding genes were DE over the three age-groups. RNA-seq quantifies not only levels of whole genes but also of their individual transcripts. Over the three age-groups, 136 transcripts were DE, 37 of which were so-called dark matter transcripts that do not map to known exons. Fourteen of these transcripts were identified as novel putative long non-coding RNAs. Evidence of isoform switching and changes in usage were found. Promoter and coding sequence usage were also altered, hinting of possible changes to mitochondrial transport within neurons. Therefore, in addition to changes in the expression of protein-coding genes, changes in transcript expression, isoform usage, and non-coding RNAs occur with age. This study demonstrates dynamic changes in RNA with age at various genomic levels, which may reflect changes in regulation of transcriptional networks and provides non-coding RNA gene candidates for further studies.

Ion channels as a possible mechanism of neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis
Genomewide studies of genetic association may prove less useful for individual risk estimation than for discovering and characterizing pathogenetic molecular pathways (Hirschhorn, 2009). In the latter task, they complement the traditional tools of bioinformatics and experimental biology. They contribute the empirical muscle that only the epidemiological observation of the disease process in humans may provide. This chapter illustrates this with the aid of a study of the types of ion channel dysfunction that may cause multiple sclerosis (MS). From a methodological point of view, this chapter complements Chapter 14 in this volume by tackling a form of interaction where the value of a causal factor determines a change of direction in the effect of another factor (Azzalini and Cox, 1984). This form of interaction, known as qualitative, is interpretable in terms of mechanism. We propose a method for testing for qualitative interaction between genetic effects, in the context of the analysis of family structured genetic data. We illustrate the method with the aid of the above mentioned study.

Predictive genetic testing: mediators and moderators of anxiety.
Mediators and moderators of anxiety following predictive genetic testing were investigated in a cross-sectional study of 208 individuals at risk for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Receiving a positive test result was associated with increased anxiety. The relationship between test result and anxiety was mediated by how threatened individuals felt by their test results. The impact of a positive test result was greater for those who felt distressed about FAP in their families, perceived FAP to be more serious, and perceived the genetic test to be more accurate. The results suggest that assessing, and possibly modifying, people's appraisals of the condition and of its impact on the family and of the threat of the genetic test may help to reduce subsequent anxiety. This has implications for the practice of genetic counseling.

Increased amygdala responses to sad but not fearful faces in major depression: relation to mood state and pharmacological treatment.
OBJECTIVE: Increased amygdala response to negative emotions seen in functional MRI (fMRI) has been proposed as a biomarker for negative emotion processing bias underlying depressive symptoms and vulnerability to depressive relapse that are normalized by antidepressant drug treatment. The purpose of this study was to determine whether abnormal amygdala responses to face emotions in depression are related to specific emotions or change in response to antidepressant treatment and whether they are present as a stable trait in medication-free patients in remission. METHOD: Sixty-two medication-free unipolar depressed patients (38 were currently depressed, and 24 were in remission) and 54 healthy comparison subjects underwent an indirect face-emotion processing task during fMRI. Thirty-two currently depressed patients were treated with the antidepressant citalopram for 8 weeks. Adherence to treatment was evaluated by measuring citalopram plasma concentrations. RESULTS: Patients with current depression had increased bilateral amygdala responses specific to sad faces relative to healthy comparison subjects and nonmedicated patients in stable remission. Treatment with citalopram abolished the abnormal amygdala responses to sad faces in currently depressed patients but did not alter responses to fearful faces. CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant amygdala activation in response to sad facial emotions is specific to the depressed state and is a potential biomarker for a negative affective bias during a depressive episode.

Robust Preconditioning for Second-Order Elliptic PDEs with Random Field Coefficients
Fluid flow and the transport of chemicals in flows in heterogeneous porous media are modelled mathematically using partial differential equations (PDEs). In deterministic modelling, material properties of the porous medium are assumed to be known explicitly. This assumption leads to tractable computations. To tackle the more realistic stochastic groundwater flow problem, it is necessary to represent the unknown permeability coefficients as random fields with prescribed statistical properties. Traditionally, large numbers of deterministic problems are solved in a Monte Carlo framework and the solutions averaged to obtain statistical properties of the solution variables. Alternatively, the so-called stochastic finite element method (SFEM) discretises the probabilistic dimension of the PDE directly. However, this approach has not gained popularity with practitioners due to a perceived high computational cost. In this report we solve the stochastic Darcy flow problem via traditional and stochastic finite element techniques, in primal and mixed formulation where appropriate. Permeability coefficients are represented using Gaussian or lognormal random fields. We focus on fast and efficient linear algebra techniques for solving both the large numbers of deterministic problems required by the Monte Carlo approach and, in contrast, the single, structured, but extremely large linear system that arises as a consequence of the SFEM. To achieve optimal computational complexity, black-box algebraic multigrid is exploited in the design of fast solvers.

Modelling the performance of horizontal heat exchanger of ground-coupled heat pump system with Egyptian conditions
The aim of this work was to investigate the effect on horizontal ground heat exchanger performance of changing soil and load parameters, and pipe horizontal separation distance for ground-coupled heat pumps under Egyptian conditions.Egypt possesses a variety of energy resources; namely fossil and renewable. The amount of renewable energy available is significant and must be utilized perfectly for the sake of achieving sustainable use of energy resources. Soils in Egypt vary widely from being clay with its thermal conductivity of 1.11 (for clay particles) to sand with its thermal conductivity of 5.77 (for sand particles). Two soil samples were chosen from the literature to be used in the investigation held in this work with boundary conditions that match the weather and ground temperature distribution conditions in Egypt.Conduction heat transfer in soils is a very complicated process especially when it is combined with time dependant boundary conditions and temperature dependent thermophysical properties of the medium. A MATLAB code was used to estimate thermophysical properties of the soil samples with three different moisture contents (0, 0.2, and saturation %) and the upper boundary condition bases on two surface dryness conditions (dry and wet). The results of the code were fed to Abqaus/CAE to analysis and predict the temperature distribution in these soils with implementing the time dependant boundary conditions to investigate the ground thermal behaviour of these soils. Also the temperature distribution around two pipes per trench of horizontal ground heat exchanger with applying synthetic load based on estimated cooling and heating degree days for one set of weather conditions. The horizontal separation distance between pipes was investigated by changing it to be 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 metres.Both the MATLAB code and Abaqus environment were validated against measured data published in the literature and their results agreed well with this data.The results of the simulation showed that the ground thermal behaviour depends mainly on the boundary conditions applied on the model. Dry soils are the worst being affected by the variation of the boundaries, because of its low volumetric heat capacities. The moisture content in the soil should be kept around 0.2 or above to get the most benefits from the presence of moisture in the vicinity of ground heat exchangers. The effect of the soil surface dryness is less significant than that of the moisture content of the entire system but it is more controllable than the moisture content. Also it was found that the horizontal separation distance (HSD) between pipes must be selected on the bases of prior knowledge of the site parameters soil type and moisture level. The results showed that the 0.4m HSD is the optimum HSD for the conditions and load profile included in this study.

[larval, latitudinal, dispersal, difference, habitat, trend, pld]

Does fish larval dispersal differ between high and low latitudes?
Several factors lead to expectations that the scale of larval dispersal and population
connectivity of marine animals differs with latitude. We examine this expectation for
demersal shorefishes, including relevant mechanisms, assumptions, and evidence.
We explore latitudinal differences in: 1) biological (e.g., species composition,
spawning mode, pelagic larval duration (PLD)), 2) physical (e.g., water movement,
habitat fragmentation), and 3) biophysical factors (primarily temperature, which could
strongly affect development, swimming ability, or feeding). Latitudinal differences
exist in taxonomic composition, habitat fragmentation, temperature, and larval
swimming, and each could influence larval dispersal. Nevertheless, clear evidence
for latitudinal differences in larval dispersal at the level of broad faunas is lacking.
For example, PLD is strongly influenced by taxon, habitat, and geographic region,
but no independent latitudinal trend is present in published PLD values. Any trends
in larval dispersal may be obscured by a lack of appropriate information, or use of
‘off the shelf’ information that is biased with regard to the species assemblages in
areas of concern. Biases may also be introduced from latitudinal differences in taxa
or spawning modes, as well as limited latitudinal sampling. We suggest research to
make progress on the question of latitudinal trends in larval dispersal.Author Posting. © The Author(s), 2013.  This is the author's version of the work.

[keloid, phenotype, scar, clinical]

A clinical characterization of familial keloid disease in unique African tribes reveals distinct keloid phenotypes.
BACKGROUND: This study is a clinical characterization of keloid scars in an African population comprising three rural tribes with familial keloids. Site distribution, morphologic features, and other characteristics of the scars were studied to assess whether each tribe had a specific scar phenotype. METHODS: Keloid scar clinics were set up at Soba Hospital in Khartoum, Sudan, for patient recruitment and management. In addition, familial keloid cases were recruited from rural tribal populations during field trips. A database including clinical and demographic data and digital photographs of all keloid cases was established. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS and SAS software. RESULTS: One hundred eleven individuals with keloid scarring (67 male subjects and 44 female subjects) were recruited. Patients were predominantly from three multigenerational pedigrees (total of 38 nuclear families) afflicted with keloid scars residing in different rural regions of Sudan. Two distinct morphologic phenotypes of keloid scarring were observed. The first phenotype has been designated "superficial spreading" (horizontal) keloid and the second has been designated "raised" (vertical) keloid. Clinically significant features and statistically measurable morphologic parameters were compared among these phenotypes (p = 0.001). Furthermore, linear claw-like extensions of keloid (transgression) were noted to be significantly higher in the superficial spreading keloid phenotype (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence of different phenotypes of keloid scarring. Two distinct phenotypes have been observed, described, and statistically verified. Each tribe demonstrated one particular phenotype, with two being superficial spreading and one being raised. Other significant clinical characteristics have been described. This is of significance in understanding both the clinical basis and the genetic basis of keloid scarring.

[mkk7, heart, kinase, role, failure]

Deprivation of MKK7 in cardiomyocytes provokes heart failure in mice when exposed to pressure overload.
There is little doubt that members of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) families play key roles in the transition from adaptive hypertrophic remodeling to heart failure. Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7 (MKK7) is a critical component of stress-activated MAP kinase signaling pathway. The role of MKK7 plays in mediating cardiac remodeling in response to load stress has yet to be defined. Herein, we investigate the role of MKK7 in regulating cardiac remodeling in response to pressure overload. We generated and examined the phenotype of mice with cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of the mkk7 gene (MKK7(cko)). Following one week of pressure overload, MKK7(cko) mice exhibited characteristic phenotypes of heart failure evidenced by deterioration in ventricular function and pulmonary congestion. Cell death assays revealed an increased prevalence of cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the MKK7(cko) heart, in which elevated p53 levels and attenuated expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) were found. Moreover, extensive interstitial fibrosis was discovered in the knockout heart likely attributable to upregulation of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling. These results reveal an essential role of MKK7 in cardiomyocytes for protecting the heart from hypertrophic insults thereby preventing the transition to heart failure.

[ra, epigenetic, genetic, susceptibility]

Genetics and epigenetics of rheumatoid arthritis.
Investigators have made key advances in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) genetics in the past 10 years. Although genetic studies have had limited influence on clinical practice and drug discovery, they are currently generating testable hypotheses to explain disease pathogenesis. Firstly, we review here the major advances in identifying RA genetic susceptibility markers both within and outside of the MHC. Understanding how genetic variants translate into pathogenic mechanisms and ultimately into phenotypes remains a mystery for most of the polymorphisms that confer susceptibility to RA, but functional data are emerging. Interplay between environmental and genetic factors is poorly understood and in need of further investigation. Secondly, we review current knowledge of the role of epigenetics in RA susceptibility. Differences in the epigenome could represent one of the ways in which environmental exposures translate into phenotypic outcomes. The best understood epigenetic phenomena include post-translational histone modifications and DNA methylation events, both of which have critical roles in gene regulation. Epigenetic studies in RA represent a new area of research with the potential to answer unsolved questions.

<p>GaNP/GaP is promising for yellow-amber-red light emitting diodes (LEDs). In this study, pressure and temperature dependent electroluminescence and photocurrent measurements on bulk GaP/GaN0.006P0.994/GaP LED structures are presented. Below similar to 110 K, emission is observed from several localized nitrogen states. At room temperature, the band-edge energy increases weakly with pressure at a rate of +1.6 meV/kbar, substantially lower than the Gamma band gap of GaP (+9.5 meV/kbar). Thus, despite the multiplicity of nitrogen levels, the band anticrossing model reasonably describes this system based on an average of the nitrogen states. Furthermore, carrier leakage into the X minima of GaP reduces the efficiency in GaNP-LEDs with increasing pressure.</p>

The use of research to improve professional practice: a systematic review of the literature
<p>In a keynote address to the Teacher Training Agency Annual Conference, Professor David Hargreaves suggested that teaching could become an evidence-based profession if educational researchers were made more accountable to teachers. This systematic literature review set out to explore: how teachers use research; which features of research encourage teachers to use research findings in their own practice; whether medical practitioners make greater use of research findings than teachers; and approaches to dissemination. Two key ideas emerge from this review. First, there appear to be common barriers to research use in both medicine and in education. Findings suggest that there is a need to create a culture in the public sector which supports and values research. There are, however, a number of factors, which appear to be more specific to the education field. Key differences in the way that research knowledge is constructed in the social sciences has led to researchers being challenged about their findings, particularly in relation to the context, generalisability and validity of the research. For these reasons the development of communication networks, links between researchers and practitioners, and greater involvement of practitioners in the research process, have emerged as strategies for improving research impact.</p>

Id helix-loop-helix proteins inhibit nucleoprotein complex formation by the TCF ETS-domain transcription factors.
The Id subfamily of helix-loop-helix (HLH) proteins plays a fundamental role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation. Id proteins are thought to inhibit differentiation mainly through interaction with other HLH proteins and by blocking their DNA-binding activity. Members of the ternary complex factor (TCF) subfamily of ETS-domain proteins have key functions in regulating immediate-early gene expression in response to mitogenic stimulation. TCFs form DNA-bound complexes with the serum response factor (SRF) and are direct targets of MAP kinase (MAPK) signal transduction cascades. In this study we demonstrate functional interactions between Id proteins and TCFs. Ids bind to the ETS DNA-binding domain and disrupt the formation of DNA-bound complexes between TCFs and SRF on the c-fos serum response element (SRE). Inhibition occurs by disrupting protein-DNA interactions with the TCF component of this complex. In vivo, the Id proteins cause down-regulation of the transcriptional activity mediated by the TCFs and thereby block MAPK signalling to SREs. Therefore, our results demonstrate a novel facet of Id function in the coordination of mitogenic signalling and cell cycle entry.

DesignGG: An R-package and web tool for the optimal design of genetical genomics experiments
Background: High-dimensional biomolecular profiling of genetically different individuals in one or more environmental conditions is an increasingly popular strategy for exploring the functioning of complex biological systems. The optimal design of such genetical genomics experiments in a cost-efficient and effective way is not trivial. Results: This paper presents designGG, an R package for designing optimal genetical genomics experiments. A web implementation for designGG is available at http://gbic.biol.rug.nl/designGG. All software, including source code and documentation, is freely available. Conclusion: DesignGG allows users to intelligently select and allocate individuals to experimental units and conditions such as drug treatment. The user can maximize the power and resolution of detecting genetic, environmental and interaction effects in a genome-wide or local mode by giving more weight to genome regions of special interest, such as previously detected phenotypic quantitative trait loci. This will help to achieve high power and more accurate estimates of the effects of interesting factors, and thus yield a more reliable biological interpretation of data. DesignGG is applicable to linkage analysis of experimental crosses, e.g. recombinant inbred lines, as well as to association analysis of natural populations.

Cleavage fracture modelling for RPV steels: Discrete model for collective behaviour of micro-cracks
The ability to predict variations in cleavage fracture toughness behaviour of ferritic RPV steels, accounting for the effects of irradiation and defect geometry, is vital to safety assessment and life extension decisions.  Local approaches to cleavage fracture offer a promising methodology to accomplish such calculations.  However, the limited progress achieved by improving the local failure probability expression suggests that the methodology for calculating global cleavage might not be adequately representing real material.  The basis for the existing methodology is the weakest-link assumption that all individual failure events are independent and non-interacting.  As a result an approach is considered which utilises a microstructure-informed model incorporating the experimental knowledge needed to postulate deterministic criteria for particle rupture and micro-crack propagation, whilst accounting for the probabilistic distribution of particle sizes.  Predicting the probability of cleavage fracture requires such models, as the macroscopic cleavage phenomenon is governed by a number of micro-structural features.The material microstructure is represented by a regular lattice of truncated octahedral cells forming a computational site-bond model, with sites located at the cell centres and connected by two distinct sets of bonds.  These bonds are modelled with structural beam elements, which represent all the possible relative deformations between coordinated sites.  Particles of various sizes are distributed at the sites in the bonds; based on an experimentally determined distribution of cleavage initiating particles in RPV steel (Euro Material A).  Metallographic examination provided a probability density of particle sizes which was fit to Weibull-type statistics.  The work has demonstrated that the interactions between individual failure events could potentially have a significant effect on the way global failure is reached.  Nucleation of micro-cracks by rupturing second-phase particles affects the subsequent micro-crack formation.  In particular, formed micro-cracks reduce the probability of further development of micro-cracks at particles outside the crack planes and enhance the probability of formation of micro-cracks at particles along the crack planes.  This affects the distribution of micro-crack sizes that should in principle be used to calculate the global probability of failure, and could be substantially different from the distribution of particle sizes used in the current local approach methods.

Global barotropic variability of the ocean in response to atmospheric forcing based on multichannel regression and Kalman filter techniques
TOPEX/POSEIDON altimetry data are employed in the analysis of the global
ocean response to atmospheric forcing. We use two different approaches to test the hypothesis
that the global sea surface height variability can be adequately described by
linear barotropic ocean models: the multichannel regression and the optimal smoothing
techniques.
We start with the simplest linear vorticity balance and continue by building a
hierarchy of more complicated models by including effects of topography and time dependence.
We use auto-regressive external (ARX) time-series models to test the hypothesis
in all of the Pacific Ocean. We also test whether any significant residual regression on the
atmospheric loading is left after the inverted barometer effect is corrected for. We find
that no linear barotropic model is consistent with the data.
We provide a check on the results of the multichannel regression by using a Kalman
filter and optimal smoother. We use sequential estimation in the form of filteringsmoothing
algorithm. We run the estimate for an area of 4000 km by 2000 km in the
Northeast Pacific. We analyze model and data error structures by simulating the model
without data assimilation. The results show that the model forecast on average explains
33% of the data variability. The Kalman filter updates the model very efficiently and
produces an estimate which explains 76% of the data variance. The optimal smoother
estimate is very similar to the Kalman filter estimate. Running the model in other regions
of the Pacific produced worse fits of the model to the data. This supports the conclusion
that the linear barotropic dynamics fails to describe the SSH variability.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution May 1996This research was partially funded by a NASA Global Change Fellowship

Pathogenesis of peroxisomal deficiency disorders (Zellweger syndrome) may be mediated by misregulation of the GABAergic system via the diazepam binding inhibitor
Background: Zellweger syndrome (ZS) is a fatal inherited disease caused by peroxisome biogenesis deficiency. Patients are characterized by multiple disturbances of lipid metabolism, profound hypotonia and neonatal seizures, and distinct craniofacial malformations. Median live expectancy of ZS patients is less than one year. While the molecular basis of peroxisome biogenesis and metabolism is known in considerable detail, it is unclear how peroxisome deficiency leads to the most severe neurological symptoms. Recent analysis of ZS mouse models has all but invalidated previous hypotheses. Hypothesis: We suggest that a regulatory rather than a metabolic defect is responsible for the drastic impairment of brain function in ZS patients. Testing the hypothesis: Using microarray analysis we identify diazepam binding inhibitor/acyl-CoA binding protein (DBI) as a candidate protein that might be involved in the pathogenic mechanism of ZS. DBI has a dual role as a neuropeptide antagonist of GABA(A) receptor signaling in the brain and as a regulator of lipid metabolism. Repression of DBI in ZS patients could result in an overactivation of GABAergic signaling, thus eventually leading to the characteristic hypotonia and seizures. The most important argument for a misregulation of GABA(A) in ZS is, however, provided by the striking similarity between ZS and "benzodiazepine embryofetopathy", a malformation syndrome observed after the abuse of GABA(A) agonists during pregnancy. Implications of the hypothesis: We present a tentative mechanistic model of the effect of DBI misregulation on neuronal function that could explain some of the aspects of the pathology of Zellweger syndrome. ?? 2004 Breitling; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Sensory neurons derived from diabetic rats have diminished internal Ca2+ stores linked to impaired re-uptake by the endoplasmic reticulum.
Distal symmetrical sensory neuropathy in diabetes involves the dying back of axons, and the pathology equates with axonal dystrophy generated under conditions of aberrant Ca2+ signalling. Previous work has described abnormalities in Ca2+ homoeostasis in sensory and dorsal horn neurons acutely isolated from diabetic rodents. We extended this work by testing the hypothesis that sensory neurons exposed to long-term Type 1 diabetes in vivo would exhibit abnormal axonal Ca2+ homoeostasis and focused on the role of SERCA (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase). DRG (dorsal root ganglia) sensory neurons from age-matched normal and 3-5-month-old STZ (streptozotocin)-diabetic rats (an experimental model of Type 1 diabetes) were cultured. At 1-2 days in vitro an array of parameters were measured to investigate Ca2+ homoeostasis including (i) axonal levels of intracellular Ca2+, (ii) Ca2+ uptake by the ER (endoplasmic reticulum), (iii) assessment of Ca2+ signalling following a long-term thapsigargin-induced blockade of SERCA and (iv) determination of expression of ER mass and stress markers using immunocytochemistry and Western blotting. KCl- and caffeine-induced Ca2+ transients in axons were 2-fold lower in cultures of diabetic neurons compared with normal neurons indicative of reduced ER calcium loading. The rate of uptake of Ca2+ into the ER was reduced by 2-fold (P<0.05) in diabetic neurons, while markers for ER mass and ER stress were unchanged. Abnormalities in Ca2+ homoeostasis in diabetic neurons could be mimicked via long-term inhibition of SERCA in normal neurons. In summary, axons of neurons from diabetic rats exhibited aberrant Ca2+ homoeostasis possibly triggered by sub-optimal SERCA activity that could contribute to the distal axonopathy observed in diabetes.

Accounting for electrode movement in MRI-informed functional EIT lung imaging
It is known to the thoracic EIT community that inaccurately known boundary shape and electrode positions can potentially cause major artefacts in reconstructions. These problems are addressed in this work by using an MR (Magnetic Resonance) image to approximate the boundary shape, and a forward problem perturbation technique to calculate an electrode movement Jacobian. Using real thorax EIT data from the fEITER system, two reconstruction algorithms, one accounting for movement and the other not, are compared. The corrections demonstrate that better spatial resolution and contrast of the lungs is obtained when accounting for electrode movement, as well as a reduction in boundary artefacts.

Guidelines for antipsychotic drug treatment of schizophrenia.
Rationale: The SiGMA algorithm and corresponding guidelines for the antipsychotic treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders were developed out of the finding that across the twelve provider units of Greater Manchester, the use of, and expenditure on, clozapine and the other new atypical antipsychotic drugs varied greatly. There were no locally agreed standards or guidelines in place for the prescription of such drugs. Individual Trusts varied in whether they had current guidelines for the prescription of antipsychotic medication, the content of such guidelines, and the extent to which the guidelines were being followed by clinicians.The SiGMA guidelines have been adapted by the Manchester Mental Health and Social Care Trust Medicines Management Committee taking into account the NICE Guidelines ‘Guidance on the use of newer (atypical) antipsychotic drugs for the treatment of schizophrenia’.Scope: The guidelines and accompanying algorithm offer a first-line choice of atypical or conventional antipsychotic treatment to be made in consultation with the patient, although the preferred treatment of choice would be an atypical antipsychotic. The algorithm avoids unnecessary delays in proceeding to clozapine, if appropriate and recognises evidence for psychological therapies in improving the outcome for patients with schizophrenia.Patient group: Primarily patients aged between 16-64 years with schizophrenia or related functional disorders. For patients with these conditions who are elderly, lower doses than in younger adults should be considered and particular attention paid to side-effects.

[algorithm, pseudoflow]

Simplifications and speedups of the pseudoflow algorithm
The pseudoflow algorithm for solving the maximum flow and minimum cut problems was devised in Hochbaum (2008). The complexity of the algorithm was shown in (2008) to be O(nm log n). Chandran and Hochbaum, (2009) demonstrated that the pseudoflow algorithm is very efficient in practice, and that the highest label version of the algorithm tends to perform best. Here, we improve the running time of the highest label pseudoflow algorithm to O(nsuperscript 3) using simple data structures and to O(nm log (nsuperscript 2/m)) using the dynamic trees data structure. Both these algorithms use a new form of Depth-First-Search implementation that is likely to be fast in practice as well. In addition, we give a new simpler description of the pseudoflow algorithm by relating it to the simplex algorithm as applied to the maximum preflow problem defined here. The interpretation of the generic pseudoflow algorithm as a simplex-like algorithm for the maximum preflow problem motivates the pseudoflow algorithm and highlights differences between the pseudoflow algorithm and the preflow-push algorithm of Goldberg and Tarjan.

A rare leucine codon in adpA is implicated in the morphological defect of bldA mutants of Streptomyces coelicolor
Streptomycetes are mycelial bacteria that produce sporulating aerial hyphae on solid media. Bald (bld) mutants fail to form aerial mycelium under at least some conditions. bldA encodes the only tRNA species able to read the leucine codon UUA efficiently, implying the involvement of a TTA-containing gene in initiating aerial growth. One candidate for such a gene was bldH, because the bldH109 mutant of Streptomyces coelicolor resembles bldA mutants in some aspects. In the work reported here, adpA c, an S. coelicolor gene similar to the Streptomyces griseus A factor-regulated adpAg, was found to complement the bldH109 mutant partially at both single and multiple copies. The sequence of adpA c from the bldH109 mutant revealed a frameshift. A constructed in frame deletion of adpA c conferred a bald colony phenotype, and the mutant behaved like bldA mutants and bldH109 in its pattern of extracellular signal exchange. Both adpA c and adpAg contain a TTA codon. A TTA-free version of adpA c was engineered by replacing the TTA leucine codon with a cognate TTG leucine codon. The adpA(TTA???TTG) gene could partially restore aerial mycelium formation to a bldA mutant when it was followed in cis by the gene ornA, as in the natural chromosomal arrangement. This indicated that the UUA codon in adpA c mRNA is the principal target through which bldA influences morphological differentiation. It also implied that translational arrest at the UUA codon in adpA c mRNA caused a polar effect on the downstream ornA, and that the poor translation of both genes contributes extensively to the deficiency of aerial mycelium formation in bldA mutants. Unlike the situation in S. griseus, adpA c transcription does not depend on the host's ??-butyrolactone signalling system, at least in liquid cultures. In addition, sigma factor BldN, which is the homologue of an S. griseus sigma factor AdsA that is absent from adpA g mutants of S. griseus, was present in the constructed adpA c null mutant of S. coelicolor.

Cardiovascular manifestations associated with influenza virus infection.
Influenza accounts for 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and up to 300,000 deaths annually. Cardiovascular involvement in acute influenza infection can occur through direct effects of the virus on the myocardium or through exacerbation of existing cardiovascular disease. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between influenza epidemics and cardiovascular mortality and a decrease in cardiovascular mortality in high risk patients has been demonstrated following vaccination with influenza vaccine. Influenza is a recognised cause of myocarditis which can lead to significant impairment of cardiac function and mortality. With recent concerns regarding another potential global pandemic of influenza the huge potential for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is discussed.

Deep sequencing of subseafloor eukaryotic rRNA reveals active fungi across marine subsurface provinces
The deep marine subsurface is a vast habitat for microbial life where cells may live on geologic timescales. Because DNA in sediments may be preserved on long timescales, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is suggested to be a proxy for the active fraction of a microbial community in the subsurface. During an investigation of eukaryotic 18S rRNA by amplicon pyrosequencing, unique profiles of Fungi were found across a range of marine subsurface provinces including ridge flanks, continental margins, and abyssal plains. Subseafloor fungal populations exhibit statistically significant correlations with total organic carbon (TOC), nitrate, sulfide, and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). These correlations are supported by terminal restriction length polymorphism (TRFLP) analyses of fungal rRNA. Geochemical correlations with fungal pyrosequencing and TRFLP data from this geographically broad sample set suggests environmental selection of active Fungi in the marine subsurface. Within the same dataset, ancient rRNA signatures were recovered from plants and diatoms in marine sediments ranging from 0.03 to 2.7 million years old, suggesting that rRNA from some eukaryotic taxa may be much more stable than previously considered in the marine subsurface.© The Author(s),  2013.

[mitochondrial, cancer, cell, breast, epithelial, human, translation, metabolic, biogenesis, marker]

Mitochondria "fuel" breast cancer metabolism: fifteen markers of mitochondrial biogenesis label epithelial cancer cells, but are excluded from adjacent stromal cells.
Here, we present new genetic and morphological evidence that human tumors consist of two distinct metabolic compartments. First, re-analysis of genome-wide transcriptional profiling data revealed that > 95 gene transcripts associated with mitochondrial biogenesis and/or mitochondrial translation were significantly elevated in human breast cancer cells, as compared with adjacent stromal tissue. Remarkably, nearly 40 of these upregulated gene transcripts were mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs), functionally associated with mitochondrial translation of protein components of the OXPHOS complex. Second, during validation by immunohistochemistry, we observed that antibodies directed against 15 markers of mitochondrial biogenesis and/or mitochondrial translation (AKAP1, GOLPH3, GOLPH3L, MCT1, MRPL40, MRPS7, MRPS15, MRPS22, NRF1, NRF2, PGC1-α, POLRMT, TFAM, TIMM9 and TOMM70A) selectively labeled epithelial breast cancer cells. These same mitochondrial markers were largely absent or excluded from adjacent tumor stromal cells. Finally, markers of mitochondrial lipid synthesis (GOLPH3) and mitochondrial translation (POLRMT) were associated with poor clinical outcome in human breast cancer patients. Thus, we conclude that human breast cancers contain two distinct metabolic compartments-a glycolytic tumor stroma, which surrounds oxidative epithelial cancer cells-that are mitochondria-rich. The co-existence of these two compartments is indicative of metabolic symbiosis between epithelial cancer cells and their surrounding stroma. As such, epithelial breast cancer cells should be viewed as predatory metabolic "parasites," which undergo anabolic reprogramming to amplify their mitochondrial "power." This notion is consistent with the observation that the anti-malarial agent chloroquine may be an effective anticancer agent. New anticancer therapies should be developed to target mitochondrial biogenesis and/or mitochondrial translation in human cancer cells.

[psoriasis, incidence, prevalence, study, united, states, person-year, estimate, adult]

Global epidemiology of psoriasis: a systematic review of incidence and prevalence.
The worldwide incidence and prevalence of psoriasis is poorly understood. To better understand this, we performed a systematic review of published population-based studies on the incidence and prevalence of psoriasis. Three electronic databases were searched from their inception dates to July 2011. A total of 385 papers were critically appraised; 53 studies reported on the prevalence and incidence of psoriasis in the general population. The prevalence in children ranged from 0% (Taiwan) to 2.1% (Italy), and in adults it varied from 0.91% (United States) to 8.5% (Norway). In children, the incidence estimate reported (United States) was 40.8/100,000 person-years. In adults, it varied from 78.9/100,000 person-years (United States) to 230/100,000 person-years (Italy). The data indicated that the occurrence of psoriasis varied according to age and geographic region, being more frequent in countries more distant from the equator. Prevalence estimates also varied in relation to demographic characteristics in that studies confined to adults reported higher estimates of psoriasis compared with those involving all age groups. Studies on the prevalence and incidence of psoriasis have contributed to a better understanding of the burden of the disease. However, further research is required to fill existing gaps in understanding the epidemiology of psoriasis and trends in incidence over time.

[bag-1, protein, cm]

BAG-1 proteins protect cardiac myocytes from simulated ischemia/reperfusion-induced apoptosis via an alternate mechanism of cell survival independent of the proteasome.
BAG-1 (Bcl-2-associated athanogene-1) proteins interact with the HSC70 and HSP70 heat shock proteins and have been proposed to promote cell survival by coordinating the function of these chaperones with the proteasome to facilitate protein degradation. Consistent with this proposal, previous analyses in cancer cells have demonstrated that BAG-1 requires protein domains important for HSC70/HSP70 and proteasome binding in order to interfere with the growth inhibition induced by heat shock (Townsend, P. A., Cutress, R. I., Sharp, A., Brimmell, M., and Packham, G. (2003) Cancer Res., 63, 4150-4157). Moreover, cellular stress triggered the relocalization of the cytoplasmic BAG-1S (approximately 36 kDa) isoform to the nucleus, and both BAG-1S and the constitutively nuclear localized BAG-1L (approximately 50 kDa) isoform suppressed heat shock-induced apoptosis to the same extent, suggesting a critical role in the nucleus. Because ischemia (I) and reperfusion (R) are important stress signals in acute and chronic heart disease, we have examined the expression and function of BAG-1 proteins in primary cardiac myocytes (CMs) and the Langendorff-perfused intact heart. The expression of both BAG-1 isoforms, BAG-1S and BAG-1L, was rapidly induced following ischemia in rat CM, and this was maintained during subsequent reperfusion. In control hearts, BAG-1S and BAG-1L were readily detectable in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. However, BAG-1S did not relocate to the nucleus following simulated I/R. BAG-1 interacted with both RAF-1 and HSC70 in CMs and the whole heart, and binding to HSC70 was increased following I/R. Overexpression of the human BAG-1S and BAG-1 M isoforms significantly reduced CM apoptosis following simulated I/R. By contrast, BAG-1L or BAG-1S fused to a heterologous nuclear localization sequence failed to protect CM. Finally, overexpression of BAG-1 deletion and point mutants unable to bind HSC70/HSP70 failed to offer cardioprotection. Surprisingly, a deletion mutant lacking the N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain, which mediates interaction with the proteasome, still promoted cardioprotection. Therefore, BAG-1 has a novel cardioprotective role, mediated via association with HSC70/HSP70, which is critical upon cytoplasmic localization but independent of the BAG-1 ubiquitin-like domain. Our studies demonstrate that BAG-1 can influence cellular response to stress by multiple mechanisms, potentially influenced by the cell type and nature of the stress signal.

[p-cadherin, hair, human, growth, hf, hjmd, silencing]

P-Cadherin Regulates Human Hair Growth and Cycling via Canonical Wnt Signaling and Transforming Growth Factor-β2.
P-cadherin is a key component of epithelial adherens junctions, and it is prominently expressed in the hair follicle (HF) matrix. Loss-of-function mutations in CDH3, which encodes P-cadherin, result in hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy (HJMD), an autosomal recessive disorder featuring sparse and short hair. Here, we attempted to recapitulate some aspects of HJMD in vitro by transfecting normal, organ-cultured human scalp HFs with lipofectamine and CDH3-specific or scrambled control siRNAs. As in HJMD patients, P-cadherin silencing inhibited hair shaft growth, prematurely induced HF regression (catagen), and inhibited hair matrix keratinocyte proliferation. In situ, membrane β-catenin expression and transcription of the β-catenin target gene, axin2, were significantly reduced, whereas glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK3β) and phospho-β-catenin immunoreactivity were increased. These effects were partially reversed by inhibiting GSK3β. P-cadherin silencing reduced the expression of the anagen-promoting growth factor, IGF-1, whereas that of transforming growth factor β 2 (TGFβ2; catagen promoter) was enhanced. Neutralizing TGFβ antagonized the catagen-promoting effects of P-cadherin silencing. In summary, we introduce human HFs as an attractive preclinical model for studying the functions of P-cadherin in human epithelial biology and pathology. This model demonstrates that cadherins can be successfully knocked down in an intact human organ in vitro, and shows that P-cadherin is needed for anagen maintenance by regulating canonical Wnt signaling and suppressing TGFβ2.Journal of Investigative Dermatology advance online publication, 14 June 2012; doi:10.1038/jid.2012.171.

FEA Modelling of a water droplet vibrating in an electric field
The dynamic behaviour of water droplets subject to AC electric fields is investigated by experiment and finite element modelling. The motion of a water droplet is considered on the surface of a metallic sphere. To understand the consequences of vibration, the FEA model is introduced to study the dynamics of a single droplet in terms of phase shift between vibration and exciting voltage. Moreover, the evolution of electric field within the whole cycle of vibration is investigated.The finite element treatment to couple the electromagnetic field with multi-phase flow field is described. The profile of the electric field and the characteristics of mechanical vibration are evaluated. Surprisingly the phase shift in these characteristics results in the maximum field occurring when the droplet is in a flattened profile rather than when it is ‘pointed’.

An analysis of the treatment of 114 patients with recurrent pleomorphic adenomas of the parotid gland
BACKGROUND: Nerve preserving surgery is widely recommended for recurrent parotid pleomorphic adenomas though the risk of further relapse may be high. Adjuvant radiotherapy may improve control but its exact role requires clarification. METHODS: A series of 114 patients with first recurrences treated between 1952 and 1992 is reviewed. Treatment modality was either surgery alone (SG; n = 63) or surgery with radiotherapy (SG + RT; n = 51). Results were determined with respect to long-term tumor control (K-M life-tables) and facial nerve function. RESULTS: The rate to second recurrence was 15% (17/114), median follow-up 14 years. There were no cases of malignant degeneration. Multinodular recurrences treated by SG were at particular high risk of relapse, but control was significantly improved with adjuvant radiotherapy (SG versus SG = RT; 43% versus 4% at 15 years, P = 0.008). In contrast, no difference was demonstrated in the uninodular tumor group (SG versus SG = RT; 15% versus 13% at 15 years, P = 0.9). The incidence of permanent facial nerve injury was 15%. CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the distinction between multinodular and uninodular recurrences; the former is at high risk of relapse and benefits from adjuvant radiotherapy whereas solitary tumors may be adequately treated by surgery alone.

X-ray micro-tomography of Carboniferous stem-Dictyoptera: new insights into early insects.
Computer reconstructions of Archimylacris eggintoni, a Carboniferous stem-group dictyopteran ('roachoid'), are presented. A siderite-hosted specimen was scanned using high-resolution X-ray microtomography (microCT), and a 'virtual fossil' was created with a resolution of 17.7 microm. This has revealed the morphology in great detail, including adhesive limb structures indicative of climbing and specializations for rapid movement. The antennae are filiform, and the mandibles are comparable to those of certain extant cockroaches, suggesting a similar generalist, saprophagous diet. The reconstruction reveals a high degree of specialization, and provides insights into the mode of life of these common Palaeozoic insects. Further microCT study of insect fossils has the potential to supplement wing venation with new characters, and hence improve fossil insect phylogenies.

Nonlinear dynamics and self-organization of rotary molecular motor ensembles
<p>The coupled nonlinear dynamics of rotary motor ensembles and an embedding fluid medium are simulated on the basis of Navier-Stokes equations. The model description considers space-dependent rotation of motors and a spatially inhomogeneous motor distribution as well as spatial fluctuations in molecular properties. The mutual influnce of motor rotations and fluid dynamics as well as spatial inhomogeneities of their molecular properties are self-consistently included. Space-time simulations visualize the complex interplay between the fluid dynamics and motor rotation and show that the dynamic coupling to the environment via the velocity field as well as the spatial inhomogeneity and distribution of rotors determines the overall behavior of the motor complex. Depending on the initial molecular distribution, rotation frequency, and fluid dynamics a spatial self-organization or a chaotic behavior may arise.</p>

Could seborrhoeic dermatitis be implicated in the pathogenesis of parkinsonism?
The spouses of a group of aged sufferers have been demonstrated to have multifarious differences relevant to parkinsonism from matched controls, which were difficult to explain by selective mating, learned or reactive behaviour. Could parkinsonism be transmissible? The frequency of inflammation and scaling on head or neck was greater (P = 0.05) in these spouses (19 available) than in controls (36), the best discriminating site of inflammation being scalp (P = 0.02). Both seborrhoeic dermatitis and overt, or pre-clinical, parkinsonism occurred in sufferers and spouses: to presume they are not causally related is to accept multiple entities. In favour of seborrhoeic dermatitis being causal for parkinsonism, rather than vice versa, is the involvement of a known organism, Pityrosporum ovale, in the dermatitis, and that the evidence of parkinsonism in the spouses indicated that they were only part way down the path towards the clinical condition.

THE MANIPULATION OF SCHEMATIC CORRESPONDENCES WITH THE QUANTIFICATION OF UNCERTAINTY IN DATASPACES
Dataspaces aim to remove upfront cost in the generation of the schema mappingsthat reconcile schematic heterogeneities, and to incrementally improve thegenerated mappings based on user feedback. The reconciliation of schematic heterogeneitiesis a crucial step for translating queries between a mediating schemaand data sources. The generation of schema mappings depends on the elicitationof conceptually equivalent schema constructs and information on schematic heterogeneities.Furthermore, many dataspace operations manipulate associationsbetween schemas, for example for generating a global schema to mediate userqueries. With a view to minimizing upfront costs associated with understandingthe relationships between schemas, many schema matching algorithms and toolshave been developed for postulating equivalent schema constructs. However, theyderive simple associations between schema constructs, and do not provide richinformation on schematic heterogeneities. Without manual refinement, the elicitationof conceptually equivalent schema constructs and schematic heterogeneitiesmay create uncertainties that must be managed.The schematic correspondences captures a wide range of one-to-one and manyto-many schematic heterogeneities. This thesis investigates the use of schematiccorrespondences as a central component in a dataspace management system. Tosupport query evaluation in a dataspace in which relationships between schemasare represented using schematic correspondences, we propose a mechanism forautomatically generating schema mappings from the schematic correspondences.We then characterise model management operators, which can underpin the bootstrapingand maintenance of dataspaces, over schematic correspondences. Tosupport the management of uncertainty in dataspaces, we propose techniques forquantifying uncertainty in the equivalence of schema constructs from evidence inthe form of similarity scores and user feedback, and provide a flexible frameworkfor incrementally updating the uncertainties in the light of new evidence.

Azole antifungal resistance today: focus on Aspergillus.
Oral triazole therapy is well established for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis (IPA), allergic aspergillosis (ABPA), and chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), and is often long-term. Resistance to triazole azole antifungal drugs in Aspergillus fumigatus is now a major clinical problem in a number of European locations, in China, Canada and the USA with particularly high frequencies from the north-west of the UK, and The Netherlands. A number of centers are reporting the continuing increasing frequency and evolution of resistance mechanisms in A. fumigatus, in both azole-naïve and patients treated with azoles. The increasing rate of resistance is of concern. A number of resistance mechanisms have been found. The biofilm modality of Aspergillus growth may have a number of therapeutic implications for aspergillosis, including antifungal resistance. Microbiological diagnosis of aspergillosis is limited by poor culture yield, leading to uncertainty about the frequency of triazole resistance. Direct resistance testing in culture-negative clinical samples may add additional insights into the prevalence of azole resistance in A. fumigatus.

Vandetanib plus pemetrexed for the second-line treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a randomized, double-blind phase III trial.
PURPOSE: Vandetanib is a once-daily oral inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor signaling. This randomized, placebo-controlled phase III study assessed the efficacy of vandetanib plus pemetrexed as second-line therapy in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (N = 534) were randomly assigned to receive vandetanib 100 mg/d plus pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) every 21 days (n = 256) or placebo plus pemetrexed (n = 278). Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary end point; overall survival, objective response rate, disease control rate, time to deterioration of symptoms, and safety were secondary assessments. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in PFS between treatment arms (hazard ratio HR, 0.86; 97.58% CI, 0.69 to 1.06; P = .108). Overall survival was also not significantly different (HR, 0.86; 97.54% CI, 0.65 to 1.13; P = .219). Statistically significant improvements in objective response rate (19% v 8%; P < .001) and time to deterioration of symptoms (HR, 0.71; P = .0052; median, 18.1 weeks for vandetanib and 12.1 weeks for placebo) were observed in patients receiving vandetanib. Adding vandetanib to pemetrexed increased the incidence of some adverse events, including rash, diarrhea, and hypertension, while showing a reduced incidence of nausea, vomiting, anemia, fatigue, and asthenia with no reduction in the dose intensity of pemetrexed. CONCLUSION: This study did not meet the primary end point of statistically significant PFS prolongation with vandetanib plus pemetrexed versus placebo plus pemetrexed. The vandetanib combination showed a significantly higher objective response rate and a significant delay in the time to worsening of lung cancer symptoms versus the placebo arm as well as an acceptable safety profile in this patient population.

[kinase, erk5, protein, fasl, cell, mek5]

Activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 5 downregulates FasL upon osmotic stress.
Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) 5 is a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) that is activated by dual phosphorylation via a unique MAPK/ERK kinase 5, MEK5. The physiological importance of this signaling cascade is underscored by the early embryonic death caused by the targeted deletion of the erk5 or the mek5 genes in mice. Here, we have found that ERK5 is required for mediating the survival of fibroblasts under basal conditions and in response to sorbitol treatment. Increased Fas ligand (FasL) expression acts as a positive feedback loop to enhance apoptosis of ERK5- or MEK5-deficient cells under conditions of osmotic stress. Compared to wild-type cells, erk5-/- and mek5-/- fibroblasts treated with sorbitol display a reduced protein kinase B (PKB) activity associated with increased Forkhead box O3a (Foxo3a) activity. Based on these results, we conclude that the ERK5 signaling pathway promotes cell survival by downregulating FasL expression via a mechanism that implicates PKB-dependent inhibition of Foxo3a downstream of phosphoinositide 3 kinase.

Age-related impairment of endothelial progenitor cell migration correlates with structural alterations of heparan sulfate proteoglycans
Aging poses one of the largest risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease. The increased propensity toward vascular pathology with advancing age maybe explained, in part, by a reduction in the ability of circulating endothelial progenitor cells to contribute to vascular repair and regeneration. Although there is evidence to suggest that colony forming unit-Hill cells and circulating angiogenic cells are subject to age-associated changes that impair their function, the impact of aging on human outgrowth endothelial cell (OEC) function has been less studied. We demonstrate that OECs isolated from cord blood or peripheral blood samples from young and old individuals exhibit different characteristics in terms of their migratory capacity. In addition, age-related structural changes were discovered in OEC heparan sulfate (HS), a glycocalyx component that is essential in many signalling pathways. An age-associated decline in the migratory response of OECs toward a gradient of VEGF significantly correlated with a reduction in the relative percentage of the trisulfated disaccharide, 2-O-sulfated-uronic acid, N, 6-O-sulfated-glucosamine (UA2S-GlcNS6S), within OEC cell surface HS polysaccharide chains. Furthermore, disruption of cell surface HS reduced the migratory response of peripheral blood-derived OECs isolated from young subjects to levels similar to that observed for OECs from older individuals. Together these findings suggest that aging is associated with alterations in the fine structure of HS on the cell surface of OECs. Such changes may modulate the migration, homing, and engraftment capacity of these repair cells, thereby contributing to the progression of endothelial dysfunction and age-related vascular pathologies.

Brain hemispheric structural efficiency and interconnectivity rightward asymmetry in human and nonhuman primates.
Evidence for interregional structural asymmetries has been previously reported for brain anatomic regions supporting well-described functional lateralization. Here, we aimed to investigate whether the two brain hemispheres demonstrate dissimilar general structural attributes implying different principles on information flow management. Common left hemisphere/right hemisphere structural network properties are estimated and compared for right-handed healthy human subjects and a nonhuman primate, by means of 3 different diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging fiber tractography algorithms and a graph theory framework. In both the human and the nonhuman primate, the data support the conclusion that, in terms of the graph framework, the right hemisphere is significantly more efficient and interconnected than the left hemisphere, whereas the left hemisphere presents more central or indispensable regions for the whole-brain structural network than the right hemisphere. From our point of view, in terms of functional principles, this pattern could be related with the fact that the left hemisphere has a leading role for highly demanding specific process, such as language and motor actions, which may require dedicated specialized networks, whereas the right hemisphere has a leading role for more general process, such as integration tasks, which may require a more general level of interconnection.

[cell, tamoxifen, resistance, cancer, mitochondrial, mcf7, epithelial, apoptosis, coculture, tigar]

Anti-estrogen resistance in breast cancer is induced by the tumor microenvironment and can be overcome by inhibiting mitochondrial function in epithelial cancer cells.
Here, we show that tamoxifen resistance is induced by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Coculture of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) MCF7 cells with fibroblasts induces tamoxifen and fulvestrant resistance with 4.4 and 2.5-fold reductions, respectively, in apoptosis compared with homotypic MCF7 cell cultures. Treatment of MCF7 cells cultured alone with high-energy mitochondrial "fuels" (L-lactate or ketone bodies) is sufficient to confer tamoxifen resistance, mimicking the effects of coculture with fibroblasts. To further demonstrate that epithelial cancer cell mitochondrial activity is the origin of tamoxifen resistance, we employed complementary pharmacological and genetic approaches. First, we studied the effects of two mitochondrial "poisons," namely metformin and arsenic trioxide (ATO), on fibroblast-induced tamoxifen resistance. We show here that treatment with metformin or ATO overcomes fibroblast-induced tamoxifen resistance in MCF7 cells. Treatment with the combination of tamoxifen plus metformin or ATO leads to increases in glucose uptake in MCF7 cells, reflecting metabolic uncoupling between epithelial cancer cells and fibroblasts. In coculture, tamoxifen induces the upregulation of TIGAR (TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator), a p53 regulated gene that simultaneously inhibits glycolysis, autophagy and apoptosis and reduces ROS generation, thereby promoting oxidative mitochondrial metabolism. To genetically mimic the effects of coculture, we next recombinantly overexpressed TIGAR in MCF7 cells. Remarkably, TIGAR overexpression protects epithelial cancer cells from tamoxifen-induced apoptosis, providing genetic evidence that increased mitochondrial function confers tamoxifen resistance. Finally, CAFs also protect MCF7 cells against apoptosis induced by other anticancer agents, such as the topoisomerase inhibitor doxorubicin (adriamycin) and the PARP-1 inhibitor ABT-888. These results suggest that the tumor microenvironment may be a general mechanism for conferring drug resistance. In summary, we have discovered that mitochondrial activity in epithelial cancer cells drives tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer and that mitochondrial "poisons" are able to re-sensitize these cancer cells to tamoxifen. In this context, TIGAR may be a key "druggable" target for preventing drug resistance in cancer cells, as it protects cancer cells against the onset of stress-induced mitochondrial dys-function and aerobic glycolysis.

INTRA-ORAL DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR ANTIFUNGAL RELEASE
Background: The placement of removable dental prostheses produces significant changes in the oral environment that may lead to adverse effects on the integrity of the oral tissues. Denture-induced candidosis, caused by candidal infection of the palatal mucosa, is the most frequent complication (40 %) in removable denture wearers. It predominantly affects immunosuppressed and medically compromised patients. In these high-risk patients the oral cavity may provide a source for Candida causing systemic infection. Oral candidosis has become a significant challenge in patients with persisting risk factors and a recurrent need for antifungal treatment. In addition, denture-induced candidosis is a mixed biofilm infection which provides multiple challenges for its management. Moreover, the persistent fungal colonisation on the fitting surfaces of denture often leads to cross infection and recurrence of mucosal lesions. These considerations highlight the clear need for new effective antifungal treatment modalities.Aims: The aims of this project were to establish a polymeric delivery device based on denture base lining polymer, poly (ethyl methacrylate) and tetrahydrofurfuryl methacrylate (PEM/THFM), for sustained delivery of antifungal agents chlorhexidine (CHX) and fluconazole (FLU), for the use in the treatment of denture-induced candidosis and to test the serviceability of the lining under investigation.Methods: A broth microdilution method was used to assess the spectrum of activity of the antifungal agents (CHX powder and FLU powder in two formulations pure and from capsules) against wide range of Candida species. Bioassay method and spectrophotometry were used to evaluate the efficiency of the PEM/THFM denture liner to release the impregnated antifungal agents and to quantify the released concentrations. Bioassay, time-kill studies and biofilm assays were used to verify the antifungal activity of the released antifungal agents. Shear bond test, water absorption, colorimetery and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy were used to test clinically important physical and mechanical properties for the impregnated liner.Results: It was found that CHX has broad-spectrum antifungal activity also among Candida species highly resistant to FLU. Both CHX and FLU became readily leached from PEM/THFM polymer up to 4 weeks in microbiologically effective concentrations. CHX demonstrated superior antifungal efficacy against planktonic and biofilm lifestyle of Candida compared to FLU. Findings show that the impregnation with antifungal agents has affected all tested properties (shear bond strength, water absorption, degree of conversion and colour stability) but these changes are comparable to other long-term lining materials and are within acceptable ranges.Conclusions: These findings indicate the feasibility of introducing an efficient treatment modality for candidal infections, especially denture-induced candidosis. A polymeric system containing CHX or FLU could assume a very promising treatment option as the drug is effective and directed to the site of pathology. Moreover, the distinct efficacy of CHX against C. albicans biofilms is a promising outcome to overcome the side effects of conventional antifungal agents and their reduced efficacy against biofilm formation.

The efficacy of sodium channel blockers to prevent phencyclidine-induced cognitive dysfunction in the rat: potential for novel treatments for schizophrenia.
Sodium channel inhibition is a well precedented mechanism used to treat epilepsy and other hyperexcitability disorders. The established sodium channel blocker and broad-spectrum anticonvulsant lamotrigine is also effective in the treatment of bipolar disorder and has been evaluated in patients with schizophrenia. Double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials found that the drug has potential to reduce cognitive symptoms of the disorder. However, because of compound-related side-effects and the need for dose titration, a conclusive evaluation of the drug's efficacy in patients with schizophrenia has not been possible. (5R)-5-(4-{(2-Fluorophenyl)methyloxy}phenyl)-l-prolinamide (GSK2) and (2R,5R)-2-(4-{(2-fluorophenyl)methyloxy}phenyl)-7-methyl-1,7-diazaspiro4.4nonan-6-one (GSK3) are two new structurally diverse sodium channel blockers with potent anticonvulsant activity. In this series of studies in the rat, we compared the efficacy of the two new molecules to prevent a cognitive deficit induced by the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor antagonist phencyclidine (PCP) in the reversal-learning paradigm in the rat. We also explored the effects of the drugs to prevent brain activation and neurochemical effects of PCP. We found that, like lamotrigine, both GSK2 and GSK3 were able to prevent the deficit in reversal learning produced by PCP, thus confirming their potential in the treatment of cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. However, higher doses than those required for anticonvulsant efficacy of the drugs were needed for activity in the reversal-learning model, suggesting a lower therapeutic window relative to mechanism-dependent central side effects for this indication.

Development and Evaluation of a Method for Measuring Breast Density
Introduction: Breast density is an important independent risk factor for breast cancer and is negatively associated with diagnostic sensitivity of mammography. Measurement of breast density can be used to identify women at increased risk of developing breast cancer and those who would benefit from additional imaging. However, measurement techniques are generally subjective and do not reflect the true three-dimensional nature of the breast and its component tissues.Method: A semi-automated method for determining the volume of glandular tissue from digitised mammograms has been developed in Manchester. It requires a calibration device (stepwedge) to be imaged alongside the breast during mammography, with magnification markers on the compression paddle to accurately determine breast thickness. Improvements to the design of the stepwedge and markers have enabled the method to be applied to the screening population for the first time. 1,289 women had their volumetric breast density measured using this method and additionally completed a questionnaire on breast cancer risk factors.Results: The method has demonstrated excellent intra- and inter-observer agreement. The median percentage breast density in the study cohort was 8.4% (interquartile range 4.9 – 14.2%). There was no significant difference between left and right breasts; the difference between MLO and CC views was significant (CC view was denser), but values were closely correlated (r = 0.92, p < 0.001). The median glandular volume was 60.1cm3 and exhibited no significant variation between left/right breasts or CC/MLO views. A number of breast cancer risk factors were found to be significantly correlated with glandular volume and percentage breast density, including age, weight, BMI, parity, current HRT use and current smoking. The strength of correlation was equal to or greater than that of visually assessed mammographic density. Glandular volume and percentage breast density measurements demonstrated strong relationships with visually assessed mammographic density, which has been shown to be highly correlated with risk.Conclusions: These findings are promising and suggest that volumetric breast density measured using this method should be associated with breast cancer risk. However, further work is required to establish this relationship directly. The method will be used in a large study, known as PROCAS (Predicting Risk Of Cancer At Screening) which aims to develop individualised breast cancer risk prediction models; these have the potential to form the basis of tailored screening intervals. Preliminary work has been undertaken to adapt the method for full field digital mammography, which suggests that it is possible to use the integrated digital detector as the calibration device.

Tumor survivin is downregulated by the antisense oligonucleotide LY2181308: a proof-of-concept, first-in-human dose study.
PURPOSE: Enhanced tumor cell survival through expression of inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) is a hallmark of cancer. Survivin, an IAP absent from most normal tissues, is overexpressed in many malignancies and associated with a poorer prognosis. We report the first-in-human dose study of LY2181308, a second-generation antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) directed against survivin mRNA. Patients and Methods: A dose-escalation study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of LY2181308 administered intravenously for 3 hours as a loading dose on 3 consecutive days and followed by weekly maintenance doses. Patients were eligible after signing informed consent, had exhausted approved anticancer therapies and agreed to undergo pre- and posttreatment tumor biopsies to evaluate reduction of survivin protein and gene expression. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were treated with LY2181308 at doses of 100 to 1,000 mg. Twenty-six patients were evaluated at the recommended phase 2 dose of 750 mg, at which level serial tumor sampling and (11)CLY2183108 PET (positron emission tomography) imaging demonstrated that ASO accumulated within tumor tissue, reduced survivin gene and protein expression by 20% and restored apoptotic signaling in tumor cells in vivo. Pharmacokinetics were consistent with preclinical modeling, exhibiting rapid tissue distribution, and terminal half-life of 31 days. CONCLUSIONS: The tumor-specific, molecularly targeted effects demonstrated by this ASO in man underpin confirmatory studies evaluating its therapeutic efficacy in cancer.

[aptamer, heparanase, enzyme, tumour, assay, cell, hpse1]

Development of novel single-stranded nucleic acid aptamers against the pro-angiogenic and metastatic enzyme heparanase (HPSE1).
Heparanase is an enzyme involved in extracellular matrix remodelling and heparan sulphate proteoglycan catabolism. It is secreted by metastatic tumour cells, allowing them to penetrate the endothelial cell layer and basement membrane to invade target organs. The release of growth factors at the site of cleaved heparan sulphate chains further enhance the potential of the tumour by encouraging the process of angiogenesis. This leads to increased survival and further proliferation of the tumour. Aptamers are single or double stranded oligonucleotides that recognise specific small molecules, peptides, proteins, or even cells or tissues and have shown great potential over the years as diagnostic and therapeutic agents in anticancer treatment. For the first time, single stranded DNA aptamers were successfully generated against the active heterodimer form of heparanase using a modified SELEX protocol, and eluted based on increasing affinity for the target. Sandwich ELISA assays showed recognition of heparanase by the aptamers at a site distinct from that of a polyclonal HPSE1 antibody. The binding affinities of aptamer to immobilised enzyme were high (7 × 10(7) to 8 × 10(7) M(-1)) as measured by fluorescence spectroscopy. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that the aptamers were able to recognise heparanase with staining comparable or in some cases superior to that of the HPSE1 antibody control. Finally, matrigel assay demonstrated that aptamers were able to inhibit heparanase. This study provides clear proof of principle concept that nucleic acid aptamers can be generated against heparanase. These reagents may serve as useful tools to explore the functional role of the enzyme and in the future development of diagnostic assays or therapeutic reagents.

[laser, model, micro-machining, sph, process]

Understanding the behaviour of pulsed laser dry and wet micromachining processes by multi-phase smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) modelling
A smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) numerical model is developed to simulate the three-phase laser micro-machining process for medical coronary stent manufacture. The open-source code SPHysics is used to model the interaction between the laser beam and workpiece. This enables the melt flow behaviour in the non-linear pulsed fibre laser micro-machining process to be modelled. The developed model considers the conversion of laser energy into heat within a very thin surface layer, heat conduction into the parent material and the phase transition between solid, liquid and vapour. A good agreement with experimental data is obtained for predicting the penetration depth and melt ejection velocity. Water is also incorporated in this model to help explain the mechanism in laser wet micro-machining and drilling. It is demonstrated that the meshless characteristics of SPH are able to model the droplets ejected from kerf where it is difficult for conventional modelling. A static beam was used throughout the model development.

[mitochondrial, cancer, cell, dysfunction, metformin, effect, breast, tumor, growth]

Mitochondrial dysfunction in breast cancer cells prevents tumor growth: understanding chemoprevention with metformin.
Metformin is a well-established diabetes drug that prevents the onset of most types of human cancers in diabetic patients, especially by targeting cancer stem cells. Metformin exerts its protective effects by functioning as a weak "mitochondrial poison," as it acts as a complex I inhibitor and prevents oxidative mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS). Thus, mitochondrial metabolism must play an essential role in promoting tumor growth. To determine the functional role of "mitochondrial health" in breast cancer pathogenesis, here we used mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs) to genetically induce mitochondrial dysfunction in either human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) or cancer-associated fibroblasts (hTERT-BJ1 cells). Our results directly show that all three UCP family members (UCP-1/2/3) induce autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction in human breast cancer cells, which results in significant reductions in tumor growth. Conversely, induction of mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer-associated fibroblasts has just the opposite effect. More specifically, overexpression of UCP-1 in stromal fibroblasts increases β-oxidation, ketone body production and the release of ATP-rich vesicles, which "fuels" tumor growth by providing high-energy nutrients in a paracrine fashion to epithelial cancer cells. Hence, the effects of mitochondrial dysfunction are truly compartment-specific. Thus, we conclude that the beneficial anticancer effects of mitochondrial inhibitors (such as metformin) may be attributed to the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction in the epithelial cancer cell compartment. Our studies identify cancer cell mitochondria as a clear target for drug discovery and for novel therapeutic interventions.

[infection, protein, tuberculosis]

Overexpression of heat-shock proteins reduces survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the chronic phase of infection.
Elevated expression of heat-shock proteins (HSPs) can benefit a microbial pathogen struggling to penetrate host defenses during infection, but at the same time might provide a crucial signal alerting the host immune system to its presence. To determine which of these effects predominate, we constructed a mutant strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis that constitutively overexpresses Hsp70 proteins. Although the mutant was fully virulent in the initial stage of infection, it was significantly impaired in its ability to persist during the subsequent chronic phase. Induction of microbial genes encoding HSPs might provide a novel strategy to boost the immune response of individuals with latent tuberculosis infection.

In-vitro resistance to imidazole antifungals in Candida albicans.
Three strains of Candida albicans from patients with chronic mucocutaneous candidosis (CMC) who relapsed during prolonged treatment with ketoconazole were compared with three other Can. albicans strains by means of an agar incorporation MIC method, a broth microdilution method for IC30 determination, and a hyphal elongation assessment method. The MICs of ketoconazole, tioconazole and miconazole were difficult to interpret, but were much higher for the three CMC strains if low inoculum concentrations and short incubation times were used. The IC30S of the three imidazoles were much higher for the CMC strains than for the others. The imidazoles all caused minimal inhibition of hyphal elongation by the three CMC strains at concentrations up to 50 mg/l. Concentrations of 0.5 mg/l caused marked inhibition of the other strains.

[keloid, senescence, scar, fibroblast]

Cellular senescence as a possible mechanism for halting progression of keloid lesions.
Keloid scarring is a consequence of aberrant wound healing that leads to expansion of the scar beyond the confines of the skin injury. Keloid scars are characterized by excessive extracellular matrix disposition, prolonged proliferation of fibroblasts, increased angiogenesis, and inflammatory cell infiltration. There is no single satisfactory treatment for keloid, and it can lead to severe disfigurements and bodily dysfunction. Thus, clarification of the mechanisms underlying keloid formation, as well as those that prevent it from behaving as a malignant tumor, has significant consequences not only for treatment of keloid but also for the prevention of malignant tumor formation. Senescence is an irreversible form of growth arrest that has been shown to play a role, both in vitro and in vivo, in preventing malignant tumorigenesis upon oncogenic stress. In this study it is shown that fibroblasts embedded inside keloid scars proliferate at a slower rate compared with either those residing at the proliferative edges of the scar or normal fibroblasts. Likewise it is demonstrated that keloid fibroblasts exhibit a cell-cycle arrest with a G2/M DNA content and a higher rate of senescence. The results also indicate that levels of the tumor suppressor protein PML are higher in the active regions of keloid. The study therefore suggests that senescence is one possible mechanism by which keloid is maintained in a benign state. On this basis, "pro-senescence therapy" should be taken into consideration when designing treatment strategies for keloid.

Using paper substrates of differing surface roughness, field emission threshold fields ranging from 0.8 to 11.6 V/mu m were observed, varying in an approximate inverse linear log relationship with the surface roughness of the underlying paper substrate. This study shows how field emission from supported nanotube films can be tailored via the morphology of the scaffold substrate, and how these composite electrodes can be straightforwardly fabricated on cheap, flexible substrates.</p>

Effect of cilofungin on phagocytosis and intracellular killing of Candida albicans by human neutrophils.
The effect of a beta glucan synthase inhibitor, cilofungin, amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine on opsonization, phagocytosis and intracellular killing of Candida albicans blastospores by glass-adherent human neutrophils was determined by microscopy and dye exclusion staining. Pretreatment of blastospores for 2, 4, 6 and 18 h with 1.25 mg/l cilofungin resulted in 24-28% of neutrophils ingesting compared to 24% with no drug present. There was no significant difference in the phagocytic index with increased incubation time. Percentage ingestion and phagocytic index values were not significantly different when blastospores were pretreated for 2 h in the presence of 3, 7, 15, 31 and 62 mg/l cilofungin. Comparable concentrations of amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine gave similar results. In the absence of cilofungin, intracellular killing after 2 h was 54%. In the presence of 1 and 10 mg/l cilofungin, 85-90% of intracellular blastospores were killed. Therapeutic levels of amphotericin B or 5-fluorocytosine did not enhance intracellular killing. These data demonstrate the potentiation of intracellular killing of Candida albicans by neutrophils in the presence of cilofungin.

[nasal, vowel, nasalized, velar, experiment, place, articulation, coda, visual, consonant]

The Acoustic and Visual Phonetic Basis of Place of Articulation in Excrescent Nasals
One common historical development in languages with distinctively nasalized vowels is the excrescence of coda velar nasals in place of nasalized vowels. For example, the dialect of French spoken in the southwestern part of France (Midi French) is characterized by words ending in the velar nasal where Parisian French has nasalized vowels and no final nasal consonant. More generally, there is a cross-linguistic tendency for the unmarked place of articulation for coda nasals, and perhaps also for stops, to be velar. In four experiments, we explored why the cross-linguistically unmarked place for the excrescent nasal is velar. The experiments test Ohala's (1975) acoustic explanation: that velar nasals, having no oral antiformants, are acoustically more similar to nasalized vowels than are bilabial or alveolar nasals. The experiments also tested an explanation based on the visual phonetics of nasalized vowels and velar nasals: velar nasals, having no visible consonant articulation, are visually more similar to nasalized vowels than are bilabial or alveolar nasals. American English listeners gave place of articulation judgments for audio-only and audio-visual tokens ending in nasal consonants ornasalized vowels. In the first and second experiments, we embedded recorded tokens of CVN (N = /m/, /n/, or /ng/) words in masking noise and presented them in audio-only and audio-visual trials. We also synthesized "placeless" nasals by repeating pitch periods from the nasalized vowel to replace the finalconsonant in CVm with nasalized vowel (henceforth "V~"). These stimuli provide a direct test of Ohala's acoustic explanation of coda velarity in nasals.   The third and fourth experiments extended these results with tokens in which the last portion of CVN (N = /m/, /n/, or /ng/) and CV~ syllables were obscured with masking noise. These experiments were designed to force listeners to assume the existence of a final consonant and to rely primarily on visual cues in a more direct test of the visual similarity of nasalized vowels and velar nasals. Taken together, the results of these four experiments suggest that excrescent coda nasals tend to be velar because nasalized vowels are both acoustically and visually similar to velarnasals.

APPLICATION OF PRESSURE-SENSITIVE PAINT TO LOW-SPEED FLOW AROUND A U-BEND OF STRONG CURVATURE
Two in-house Pressure-Sensitive Paint (PSP) formulations have been developed and tested in the low-speed regime on the flow around a U-bend of strong curvature. The two PSP formulations use tris-Bathophenanthroline Ruthenium Perchlorate (Ru (II)) and Platinum tretakis (pentafluorophenyl) Porphyrin (PtTFPP) as their photoactive molecules, incorporated in identical sol-gel matrices. Ru (II) emits a broad peak centered at 610nm while PtTFPP emits a much narrower peak at 650nm. The paints were illuminated using two in-house constructed blue LED lights with peak emission of 468nm. These luminophores have been tested with gauge inlet pressures of 3000 and 1250 Pa respectively. A further sample was tested with a gauge pressure of 500 Pa. In-situ calibration was utilized to minimize the temperature dependency change between wind-on and wind-off images. Both paints captured the flow characteristics and gave predictable surface pressure maps despite the challenges inherent with using such low pressures.

Capacitively-Coupled Impedance Measurements for ERT
The paper explores the potential for using capacitively-coupled electrodes in electrical resistance tomography. Such electrodes are less vulnerable to corrosion and electrochemical effects that plague conventional electrical resistance tomographs utilising electrodes that are in intimate contact with the material. A model is proposed that takes account of the complex impedance of the insulating layer. The performance of the resulting passive network of components has been simulated up to 1 MHz excitation frequency. 2D finite element modelling has been used to explore the measurements that might be expected from electrodes distributed around the boundary of a vessel. Except for the adjacent measurements the modelled impedances are within 1% of those for conventional electrodes.

Equilibrium and transient sorption of vapours and gases in the polymer of intrinsic microporosity PIM-1
The gravimetric sorption technique was used for the study of equilibrium and transient sorption of various groups of vapours (alcohols, hydrocarbons, water) and gases (methane, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide) in the polymer of intrinsic microporosity PIM-1 at 25 °C. Sorption isotherms of all compounds, except gases and water, exhibited S-shaped character, while the isotherms of gases are linear or concave over the inspected pressure region. Sorption isotherms of vapours were quantitatively parameterized with the Guggenheim, Anderson and de Boer (GAB) layered-adsorption model, which provided a comparable approximation of the data on carbon dioxide as the dual mode sorption model. Abnormally fast kinetics of transient sorption (superdiffusion) was observed in the region of diluted and saturated vapours of all measured compounds, except water, n-butane and carbon dioxide. The anomalous sorption kinetics was well parameterized with the convective–diffusion model. The anomalous nature of the mass transport in PIM-1 is also demonstrated by distinct trends for gases, alkanes and alcohol vapours in the correlations of diffusion coefficients with penetrant molecular volume and solubility coefficients with the square of critical temperature. The results obtained in this work indicate the occurrence of a transport mode that has a different nature than the classically employed solution-diffusion model.

Solvation pressure in chloroform
<p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of chloroform vapor and liquid at normal temperature and pressure and liquid under hydrostatic pressure are presented, giving bond lengths and vibrational frequencies as functions of pressure. The change in bond lengths between vapor and liquid at normal temperature and pressure is consistent with a pressure equivalent to the cohesive energy density (CED) of the liquid, supporting the solvation pressure model which predicts that solvated molecules or nanoparticles experience a pressure equal to the CED of the liquid. Experimental data for certain Raman frequencies of chloroform in the vapor phase, in the liquid, and in the liquid under pressure are presented and compared to MD. Results for C-Cl vibrational modes are in general agreement with the solvation pressure model whereas frequencies associated with the C-H bond are not.

Observation of long-range, near-side angular correlations in proton-proton collisions at the LHC
Results on two-particle angular correlations for charged particles emitted in proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energies of 0.9, 2.36, and 7 TeV are presented, using data collected with the CMS detector over a broad range of pseudorapidity (η) and azimuthal angle (ϕ). Short-range correlations in Δη, which are studied in minimum bias events, are characterized using a simple “independent cluster” parametrization in order to quantify their strength (cluster size) and their extent in η (cluster decay width). Long-range azimuthal correlations are studied differentially as a function of charged particle multiplicity and particle transverse momentum using a 980 nbsuperscript −1 data set at 7 TeV. In high multiplicity events, a pronounced structure emerges in the two-dimensional correlation function for particle pairs with intermediate p subscript T of 1–3 GeV/c, 2.0 < |Δη| < 4.8 and Δϕ ≈ 0. This is the first observation of such a long-range, near-side feature in two-particle correlation functions in pp or p−overp collisions.

Stable isotope monitoring of benthic–planktonic coupling using salt marsh fish
Salt marshes are important coastal ecosystems whose trophic function can be monitored with stable isotopes of abundant fish biosentinel species such as the mummichog Fundulus heteroclitus and the Atlantic silverside Menidia menidia. We compared movement patterns and feeding biology of these species in the summers of 1999 and 2000 in the Rowley River salt marsh estuary north of Boston, Massachusetts, USA. A 15N tracer addition experiment showed that fish of both species were more resident than transient, with mummichogs resident at scales of 1 km or less. Natural abundance stable isotope C, N, and S distributions showed that mummichogs feed more strongly in the benthic food web while silversides feed more in the planktonic food web, with % benthic feeding respectively averaging 58 ± 5 and 32 ± 3% (mean ± 95% confidence limit, CL). For both species, isotope results indicated considerable individual specialization in foraging behavior, likely related to use of channel habitat versus use of the marsh. Power analysis showed that measuring 3 composite samples each comprising 10 to 15 individual fish should provide relatively low errors of 0.5‰ (95% CL) or less around stable isotope averages. Use of such composite samples in monitoring programs will allow detection of significant temporal and spatial changes in benthic-planktonic coupling for salt marsh ecosystems, as recorded in average fish diets. Analyzing some individual fish also is recommended to obtain more detailed information on fish food sources, feeding specializations, and end-member isotope values used in estimating importance of benthic and planktonic food sources.Author Posting. © Inter-Research, 2008.

Identification of nuclear protein targets for six leukemogenic tyrosine kinases governed by post-translational regulation.
Mutated tyrosine kinases are associated with a number of different haematological malignancies including myeloproliferative disorders, lymphoma and acute myeloid leukaemia. The potential commonalities in the action of six of these leukemogenic proteins on nuclear proteins were investigated using systematic proteomic analysis. The effects on over 3600 nuclear proteins and 1500 phosphopeptide sites were relatively quantified in seven isogenic cell lines. The effects of the kinases were diverse although some commonalities were found. Comparison of the nuclear proteomic data with transcriptome data and cytoplasmic proteomic data indicated that the major changes are due to post-translational mechanisms rather than changes in mRNA or protein distribution. Analysis of the promoter regions of genes whose protein levels changed in response to the kinases showed the most common binding site found was that for NFκB whilst other sites such as those for the glucocorticoid receptor were also found. Glucocorticoid receptor levels and phosphorylation were decreased by all 6 PTKs. Whilst Glucocorticoid receptor action can potentiate NFκB action those proteins where genes have NFκB binding sites were in often regulated post-translationally. However all 6 PTKs showed evidence of NFkB pathway modulation via activation via altered IkB and NFKB levels. Validation of a common change was also undertaken with PMS2, a DNA mismatch repair protein. PMS2 nuclear levels were decreased in response to the expression of all 6 kinases, with no concomitant change in mRNA level or cytosolic protein level. Response to thioguanine, that requires the mismatch repair pathway, was modulated by all 6 oncogenic kinases. In summary common targets for 6 oncogenic PTKs have been found that are regulated by post-translational mechanisms. They represent potential new avenues for therapies but also demonstrate the post-translational regulation is a key target of leukaemogenic kinases.

Searching for trials relevant to some query is laborious due to the immense number of existing protocols. Apart from search, writing new trials includes composing detailed eligibility criteria, which might be time-consuming, especially for new researchers. In this paper we present ASCOT, an efficient search application customised for clinical trials. ASCOT uses text mining and data mining methods to enrich clinical trials with metadata, that in turn serve as effective tools to narrow down search.

Global epidemiology of psoriasis: a systematic review of incidence and prevalence.
The worldwide incidence and prevalence of psoriasis is poorly understood. To better understand this, we performed a systematic review of published population-based studies on the incidence and prevalence of psoriasis. Three electronic databases were searched from their inception dates to July 2011. A total of 385 papers were critically appraised; 53 studies reported on the prevalence and incidence of psoriasis in the general population. The prevalence in children ranged from 0% (Taiwan) to 2.1% (Italy), and in adults it varied from 0.91% (United States) to 8.5% (Norway). In children, the incidence estimate reported (United States) was 40.8/100,000 person-years. In adults, it varied from 78.9/100,000 person-years (United States) to 230/100,000 person-years (Italy). The data indicated that the occurrence of psoriasis varied according to age and geographic region, being more frequent in countries more distant from the equator. Prevalence estimates also varied in relation to demographic characteristics in that studies confined to adults reported higher estimates of psoriasis compared with those involving all age groups. Studies on the prevalence and incidence of psoriasis have contributed to a better understanding of the burden of the disease. However, further research is required to fill existing gaps in understanding the epidemiology of psoriasis and trends in incidence over time.

Time for a change? The semantics and pragmatics of marking temporal shift and contrast
This paper contributes to the understanding of temporal markers semantically or pragmatically equivalent to English now and then. It presents both a review of existing proposals regarding such markers and new data from an Australian language, Jaminjung. Using Discourse Representation Theory and Segmented Discourse Representation Theory, we analyse a (non-deictic) temporal marker in Jaminjung, taking account of its behaviour in discourse. We argue that this marker serves to introduce a temporal boundary and focuses on the eventuality that is currently being talked about from the temporal perspective of this eventuality. This analysis, combined with a recent proposal regarding the expressive nature of topics, can explain the otherwise peculiar function of the same marker, to signal a shift in sentence topic. We also argue that the contrastive function associated with this marker, but also with now and equivalents in other languages, results from pragmatic principles rather than being part of their semantics. By stating that some eventuality holds at a temporal reference point which is different from the reference point associated with a previous clause, a speaker implies that this eventuality is different from – and in this sense, contrasts with – the one denoted by that clause.

Real-space Green's tensors for stress and strain in crystals with cubic anisotropy
<p>Real-space Green's tensors are presented for the calculation of the stress or strain in infinite cubic crystals containing buried quantum wires or dots of arbitrary shape and composition, including the cubic anisotropy of elastic constants. The Green's tensors are obtained as a polynomial series to second order in Delta, an expansion coefficient defined in terms of the elastic stiffnesses. The zeroth-order term in the series is the usual isotropic Green's tensor. The results agree extremely well with the numerical, exact formulation of Pan and Yang E. Pan and B. Yang, J. Appl. Phys. 90, 6190 (2001) but compute considerably faster and are easier to implement. The present approach is used to determine the strain in the direction normal to the plane of a quantum well in different orientations. This constitutes a stringent test of the approximate Green's tensor series and results are found to be in excellent agreement with standard solutions. The Green's-function expansion for the hydrostatic strain is presented and found to be of a simple form for both dots and wires.</p>

Treatment of symptomatic abnormal skin scars with electrical stimulation.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of non-invasive biofeedback electrical stimulation on symptomatic abnormal skin scars. METHOD: Thirty patients with over 140 scars with long-term pain and itch were recruited into the study. Patients monitored the intensity of symptoms (pain and itching) on a numerical rating scale. In addition, a modified Manchester scar scale was used to objectively assess digital photographs of each scar in terms of colour, contour, distortion and texture, while a non-invasive spectrophotometric intracutaneous analysis was used to monitor the scars' physical characteristics. RESULTS: The electrical stimulation device resulted in a clinically and statistically significant (p < 0.05) reduction of symptoms and scar scores. Pain and itch scores were both reduced to a median score of 0 by 2 months, from a baseline of 7 and 6 respectively. Scar scores were reduced from a baseline of 14 to a median score of 11 by 2 months. CONCLUSION: These results give a preliminary indication of the potential role of non-invasive biofeedback electrical stimulation in the management of chronic scar pain and itch.

The development of synthetic methodology for stereoselective synthesis of aminoglycosides
AbstractRNA is recognised as an important biomolecule involved in many broad cellular functions such as transcription, translation regulation and protein synthesis.  Most pathogenic viruses replicate their genome as RNA during some stages in their life cycle.  There is an urgent need to develop new methods to treat numerous viral diseases by targeting RNA and to understand the processes by which RNA-protein complexation can be inhibited.  Our study focuses on the interactions between the HIV-1 Rev Responsive Element RNA (RRE) with a series of aminoglycosides developed jointly between our group in Manchester and GSK (USA).  Even though a number of novel aminoglycoside have been explored previously, they are complex, large molecular weight compounds with low specificity, which limits their use as RNA recognition ligands and anti-viral drugs.  The key problem is to be able to synthesise precursors by short, direct routes, avoiding significant detours caused by traditional carbohydrate protecting group strategies, while still delivering sterocontrol and opportunities to diversify. In chapter II we describe our efforts to synthesize the 6-glucosamine moiety (A-ring).  A flexible synthesis of 6-aminoglucosamine derivatives can be accomplished in 5 steps using a totally regioselective enzymatic hydrolysis, controlled oxidation to sensitive but manageable aldehydes (hitherto rarely accomplished with a C-4 OAc), and reductive amination technology that allow for unprecedented diversification. In a different approach stereocontrolled synthesis of a model compound was achieved in 4 steps including a novel TEMPO oxidation and a one-pot oxidation/imine-reduction for the complete synthesis of the molecule.Chapter III describes our attempts towards the development of a robust stereoselective O-glycosylation strategy using Lewis acids. In pursuance of an efficient synthesis of our designed RNA binder target compound the stereoselective formation of the glycosidic linkage connecting the A-ring with the 2-DOS ring is an important step. This chapter also gives a general overview of the challenges involved in glycosylation followed by the strategies we employed to overcome some of these issues. We discuss our unusual stereocontrolled glycosylation in which, despite a neighbouring “participatory” group at C-2, the α-glycoside is delivered in high yield. This result implies that the reaction does not occur through a conventional neighbouring group participation.

[whisker, trident, ground]

Structure, function, and cortical representation of the rat submandibular whisker trident
Although the neurobiology of rodent facial whiskers has been studied intensively, little is known about sensing in other vibrissae. Here we describe the under-investigated submandibular “whisker trident” on the rat's chin. In this three-whisker array, a unique unpaired midline whisker is laterally flanked by two slightly shorter whiskers. All three whiskers point to the ground and are curved backwards. Unlike other whiskers, the trident is not located on an exposed body part. Trident vibrissae are not whisked and do not touch anything over long stretches of time. However, trident whiskers engage in sustained ground contact during head-down running while the animal is exploring or foraging. In biomechanical experiments, trident whiskers follow caudal ground movement more smoothly than facial whiskers. Remarkably, deflection angles decrease with increasing ground velocity. We identified one putative trident barrel in the left somatosensory cortex and two barrels in the right somatosensory cortex. The elongated putative trident-midline barrel is the longest and largest whisker barrel, suggesting that the midline trident whisker is of great functional significance. Cortical postsynaptic air-puff responses in the trident representation show much less temporal precision than facial whisker responses. Trident whiskers do not provide as much high-resolution information about object contacts as facial whiskers. Instead, our observations suggest an idiothetic function: their biomechanics allow trident whiskers to derive continuous measurements about ego motion from ground contacts. The midline position offers unique advantages in sensing heading direction in a laterally symmetric manner. The changes in trident deflection angle with velocity suggest that trident whiskers might function as a tactile speedometer.© The Author(s),  2013.

[patient, endometriosis, pain, ib, visceral, bowel, symptom, mild]

IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME AND ENDOMETRIOSIS: IS THERE A CONNECTION?
Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is an extremely common condition affecting approximately 10-15% of the population. Lower abdominal pain is a common feature and, if the patient also has gynaecological symptoms such as heavy periods, they may be referred to a gynaecologist especially when the bowel symptoms are relatively mild. In this setting a laparoscopy is often undertaken and endometriosis commonly identified as this condition affects up to 10% of women. Consequently pain is frequently attributed to the endometriosis even when it is relatively mild. However it is a common observation amongst gynaecologists that women with mild endometriosis often have severe symptoms which do not seem to respond well to treatment. This raises the possibility that their pain may not actually be due to endometriosis or is being amplified by the visceral hypersensitivity which is a characteristic feature of irritable bowel syndrome.Methods: 20 patients with minimal-mild endometriosis, 20 with moderate-severe endometriosis, 20 healthy volunteers (HV) who have had laparoscopy for sterilisation, 20 IBS patients and 20 patients with pain who were found to have a normal pelvis (on laparoscopy) were studied. Gastrointestinal, gynaecological, and noncolonic symptoms were recorded as well as demography, quality of life and psychological status. Visceral sensitivity was assessed in all patients and abdominal distension was studied in a sub group of 26 endometriosis patients and 20 IBS patients.Results: 20 (100%) of IBS patients, 13 (65%) of minimal-mild endometriosis patients, 11 (55%) of moderate-severe endometriosis patients, 17 (85%) of laparoscopic negative pain patients and no healthy volunteers fulfilled ROME III criteria for IBS. Patients with endometriosis and IBS had similar levels of visceral sensitivity which were significantly lower than that observed in controls (p=0·002, p<0·001).In particular, both minimal-mild and moderate-severe endometriosis patients had significantly lower (mean-95% CI) pain thresholds in mmHg 28.1(24.5, 31.6) and 28.8(24.9, 32.6) respectively compared with controls 39·5 (36·0, 43·0) p=0.001and p=0.002. However, with few exceptions, there were no distinguishing features between patients in terms of demography, symptomatology and distension.Conclusion: Clinically, it is very difficult to distinguish between endometriosis and IBS. However, visceral hypersensitivity appears to be a major component of endometriosis and may explain the problem of excessive pain especially in patients with mild disease offering a potential new target for treatment

High-spin spectroscopy of natural and unnatural parity states in the mirror-pair <SUP>45</SUP>V/<SUP>45</SUP>Ti
<p>High-spin states in the proton-rich nucleus <SUP>45</SUP>V have been identified for the first time. A comprehensive gamma-ray decay scheme has been established following an experiment performed at the Vivitron accelerator at IReS Strasbourg by using the Euroball gamma-ray detector array coupled to the Neutron Wall and Euclides detector arrays. The natural (negative-) parity scheme is identified up to the <i>f</i><sub>7/2</sub> band termination in addition to a positive-parity collective structure based on a <i>d</i><sub>3/2</sub> particle-hole excitation. Comparison of this scheme with that of the mirror partner, <sup>45</sup>Ti, has yielded detailed information on the variation of Coulomb energy as a function of excitation energy and angular momentum. This is the first time that such an analysis has been performed for a collective structure built on a cross-shell excitation. Comparison of the observed Coulomb energies with those predicted by large-scale shell-model calculations is presented. In this case, unusually, the calculations do not fare as well as for heavier nuclei in the shell. In addition, stark differences between the two nuclei are observed for the decay intensities of the parity-changing <i>E</i>1 decays that de-excite the positive-parity deformed bands.</p>

Evaluation of novel combined carbogen USPIO (CUSPIO) imaging biomarkers in assessing the antiangiogenic effects of cediranib (AZD2171) in rat C6 gliomas.
The recently described combined carbogen USPIO (CUSPIO) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method uses spatial correlations in independent imaging biomarkers to assess specific components of tumor vascular structure and function. Our study aimed to evaluate CUSPIO biomarkers for the assessment of tumor response to antiangiogenic therapy. CUSPIO imaging was performed in subcutaneous rat C6 gliomas before and 2 days after treatment with the potent VEGF-signaling inhibitor cediranib (n = 12), or vehicle (n = 12). Histological validation of Hoechst 33342 uptake (perfusion), smooth muscle actin staining (maturation), pimonidazole adduct formation (hypoxia) and necrosis were sought. Following treatment, there was a significant decrease in fractional blood volume (-43%, p < 0.01) and a significant increase in hemodynamic vascular functionality (treatment altered ΔR(2) *(carbogen) from 1.2 to -0.2 s(-1) , p < 0.05). CUSPIO imaging revealed an overall significant decrease in plasma perfusion (-27%, p < 0.05) following cediranib treatment, that was associated with selective effects on immature blood vessels. The CUSPIO responses were associated with a significant 15% reduction in Hoechst 33342 uptake (p < 0.05), but no significant difference in vascular maturation or necrosis. Additionally, treatment with cediranib resulted in a significant 40% increase in tumor hypoxia (p < 0.05). The CUSPIO imaging method provides novel and more specific biomarkers of tumor vessel maturity and vascular hemodynamics, and their response to VEGF-signaling inhibition, compared to current MR imaging biomarkers utilized in the clinic. Such biomarkers may prove effective in longitudinally monitoring tumor vascular remodeling and/or evasive resistance in response to antiangiogenic therapy.

[cell, dendritic, th2, ligand, notch, expression]

Dendritic cell expression of the Notch ligand jagged2 is not essential for Th2 response induction in vivo.
We have addressed the hypothesis that Notch ligands play a decisive role in determining the ability of antigen-presenting cells to influence T cell polarization. Dendritic cells displayed distinct expression profiles of Delta and Jagged ligands for Notch when exposed to biologically relevant pathogen preparations associated with Th1 or Th2 responses. Expression of delta4 was increased, and jagged2 decreased, after dendritic cell exposure to the Th1-promoting bacterium Propionibacterium acnes. In contrast, soluble egg antigen (SEA) from the parasitic helminth Schistosoma mansoni, a potent Th2 inducer, failed to significantly alter dendritic cell expression of any of the Notch ligands measured. Irrespective of this, jagged2-deficient dendritic cells were severely impaired in their ability to instruct Th2 polarization of naive T cells in vitro. However, the ability of SEA-pulsed jagged2-deficient dendritic cells to induce a Th2 response in vivo was unimpaired relative to jagged2-sufficient dendritic cells. Further, jagged2-deficient dendritic cells activated by P. acnes exhibited no evidence of enhanced (or impaired) Th1 induction in vivo. These data suggest that, although involved in Th2 direction in vitro, jagged2 is not fundamentally required for Th2 induction by SEA-activated dendritic cells in vivo.

Eotaxin and eotaxin receptor (CCR3) expression in Sephadex particle-induced rat lung inflammation.
The beta chemokine eotaxin is a potent eosinophil activator and chemoattractant. We examined immunohistochemically eotaxin protein expression in a range of normal rat tissues and in rat lung during Sephadex particle-induced pulmonary inflammation. The time course of eotaxin expression in lung at various time points after Sephadex administration was related to the appearance of eosinophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and tissue distribution of eotaxin receptor (CCR3) positive cells. Results showed that eotaxin protein was constitutively expressed by both lung airway epithelial cells and gut epithelial cells in normal tissues in the absence of inflammation. During Sephadex induced pulmonary inflammation, eotaxin expression increased in alveolar macrophages prior to the major increase in eosinophil numbers which reached a peak at 72 h. The pattern of eotaxin pulmonary expression and the location of CCR3 receptor positive cells suggest a chemoattractant gradient resulting in migration firstly into the tissue and subsequently through the airway epithelium into the airways. Treatment of rats with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone or the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A reduced eosinophil entry into lung tissue and airways but had no apparent effect on eotaxin expression in vivo, indicating that both these drugs inhibit eosinophil recruitment either by an eotaxin-independent mechanism, or by targetting factors that synergise with eotaxin, or an event post eotaxin expression.

An Assessment of Adalimumab Efficacy in Three Phase III Clinical Trials Using the European Consensus Programme Criteria for Psoriasis Treatment Goals.
Background:  The European Consensus Programme (ECP) established pan-European consensus definitions of psoriasis disease severity and treatment goals among 19 psoriasis experts from European nations. Objectives: Use ECP treatment goals to retrospectively assess adalimumab efficacy in patients who participated in Phase III clinical trials and met ECP criteria for moderate to severe psoriasis. Methods:  Three trials were analyzed: CHAMPION (N=108), REVEAL (N=814), and BELIEVE (N=364). Moderate to severe psoriasis was defined as Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) >10, with either >10% body surface area (BSA) involvement or Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) >10. Treatment goals were achieved with either Treatment Success (≥75% PASI score reduction) or Intermediate Response (PASI response ≥50% and <75%) with DLQI ≤5. Results:  Percentages of patients who achieved treatment goals at Week 16 in CHAMPION, REVEAL, and BELIEVE were, respectively, 1) Treatment Success, 79.3%, 72.1%, and 68.2%; 2) Intermediate Response, 1.7%, 5.0%, and 5.0%; or 3) either goal, 81.0%, 77.1%, and 73.2%. DLQI ≤5 at Week 16 was achieved by 70.7%, 70.1%, and 67.4% of patients, respectively. Differences between percentages of adalimumab- vs. placebo-treated patients achieving Treatment Success were statistically significant (P <0.001) from Week 4 and Week 8 of REVEAL and CHAMPION, respectively. Conclusion:  Treatment Success was achieved by >93% of patients who attained treatment goals. At Week 16 >70% of patients achieved ECP treatment goals and met ECP criteria for continued treatment without modification. These results support the utility of ECP treatment goals for the assessment of therapeutic efficacy in moderate to severe psoriasis.

Interleukin 10 genotypes in irritable bowel syndrome: evidence for an inflammatory component?
BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammation may play a role in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome in some individuals, such as in those who develop symptoms following a dysenteric illness. Persisting inflammation, resulting from an imbalance of cytokines regulating the inflammatory response, is one possible mechanism. As the elaboration of cytokines is under genetic control, this study was designed to establish whether there might be a genetic predisposition to an altered pattern of anti-inflammatory cytokine production in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. SUBJECTS: A total of 230 unselected patients with irritable bowel syndrome and 450 healthy, ethnically matched controls were studied. METHODS: DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes of subjects. Allele and genotype frequencies were determined for the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 at the site (-1082) concerned with production in lymphocytes. Transforming growth factor beta(1) (codons 10 and 25) genotypes were also examined in a smaller group of subjects. RESULTS: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome had significantly reduced frequencies of the high producer genotype for interleukin 10 than controls (21% v 32%; p=0.003). There was no apparent relationship with any particular bowel habit subtype. Genotypes for transforming growth factor beta(1) were not altered. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest that at least some patients with irritable bowel syndrome may be genetically predisposed to produce lower amounts of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10. This lends some support to the hypothesis that there may be an inflammatory or genetic component in some cases of this condition and that further studies in specific irritable bowel syndrome subgroups are justified.

Site-specific immunophenotyping of keloid disease demonstrates immune upregulation and the presence of lymphoid aggregates.
Summary Background  Keloid disease (KD) is a common fibroproliferative disorder of unknown aetiology. T cells and macrophages are increased in KD and are thought to contribute to its pathogenesis. However, while a link between inflammation and fibrotic disorders is well known for other disorders, it remains undetermined in KD. Objectives  Systematically to immunophenotype the inflammatory infiltrate of KD in situ in a site-specific manner, and to compare this with normal skin and scar tissue. Methods  Sixty-eight keloid cases were screened for the presence of all three (intralesional, perilesional and extralesional) keloid-associated specific tissue sites. Subsequently, a complete set of 25 keloid biopsies (from different patients) was compared with normal skin (n = 11) and normal scar (n = 11) samples and subjected to systematic, site-specific quantitative immunohistomorphometry and histochemistry, using a range of immunological markers of B cells, T cells, macrophages, mast cells (MCs) and Langerhans cells. Results  T cells, B cells, degranulated and mature MCs (coexpressing OX40 ligand) and alternative macrophages (M2) were all significantly increased in intralesional and perilesional KD sites compared with normal skin and scar tissue (P < 0·05). Additionally, 10 of 68 KD cases (15%) showed the presence of distinctive lymphoid aggregates, which resembled mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). Conclusions  The increased number and activity of MCs and M2 may implicate inflammation in the fibrotic process in KD. The distinct KD-associated lymphoid aggregate resembles MALT, for which we propose the term 'keloid-associated lymphoid tissue' (KALT). It may perpetuate inflammatory stimuli that promote KD growth. KALT, MCs and M2 are promising novel targets for future KD therapy.

A Probabilistic Approach to Improving the Stability of Meshed Power Networks with Embedded HVDC Lines
This thesis investigates the effects of High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) lines andmulti-terminal grids on power system small-disturbance stability in the presence ofoperational uncertainties. The main outcome of this research is the comprehensiveprobabilistic assessment of the stability improvements that can be achieved through theuse of supplementary damping control applied to HVDC systems.Power systems are increasingly operated closer to stability boundaries in order toimprove their efficiency and economic value whilst a growing number of conventionalcontrolled power plants are being replaced by stochastic renewable generation sources.The resulting uncertainty in conditions can increase the risk of operational stabilityconcerns and should be thoroughly evaluated. There is also a growing necessity toexplore the potential improvements and challenges created by the introduction of newequipment, such as HVDC systems. In recent years, HVDC systems have become moreeconomically competitive and increasingly flexible, resulting in a proliferation ofprojects. Although primarily installed for power transmission purposes, their flexibilityand controllability can provide further benefits, such as the damping of persistentoscillations in the interconnected networks.This work contributes to a number of areas of power systems research, specificallysurrounding the effects of HVDC systems on the small-disturbance stability oftransmission networks. The application and comprehensive assessment of a Wide AreaMeasurement System (WAMS) based damping controller with various HVDC systemsis completed. The studies performed on a variety of HVDC technology types andconfigurations – as well as differing AC test networks – demonstrate the potential forHVDC-based Power Oscillation Damping (POD). These studies include examinationsof previously unexplored topics such as the effects of available modulation capacity andthe use of voltage source converter multi-terminal HVDC grids for POD. Followingthese investigations, a methodology to probabilistically test the robustness of HVDC based damping controllers is developed. This methodology makes use of classificationtechniques to identify possible mitigation options for power system operators whenperformance is sub-optimal. To reduce the high computational burden associated withthis methodology, the Probabilistic Collocation Method (PCM) is developed in order toefficiently identify the statistical distributions of critical system modes in the presenceof uncertainties. Methods of uncertain parameter reduction based on eigenvaluesensitivity are developed and demonstrated to ensure accurate results when the PCM isused with large test systems. Finally, the concepts and techniques introduced within thethesis are combined to probabilistically design a WAMS-based POD controller morerobust to operational uncertainties. The use of the PCM during the probabilistic designresults in rapid and robust synthesis of HVDC-based POD controllers.

A proposal for the reference-based annotation of de novo transposable element insertions.
Understanding the causes and consequences of transposable element (TE) activity in the genomic era requires sophisticated bioinformatics approaches to accurately identify individual insertion sites. Next-generation sequencing technology now makes it possible to rapidly identify new TE insertions using resequencing data, opening up new possibilities to study the nature of TE-induced mutation and the target site preferences of different TE families. While the identification of new TE insertion sites is seemingly a simple task, the mechanisms of transposition present unique challenges for the annotation of de novo transposable element insertions mapped to a reference genome. Here I discuss these challenges and propose a framework for the annotation of de novo TE insertions that accommodates known mechanisms of TE insertion and established coordinate systems for genome annotation.

Social Assistance in Developing Countries
The rapid spread of large-scale and innovative social transfers in the developing world has made a key contribution to the significant reduction in global poverty over the last decade. Explaining how flagship anti-poverty programmes emerged, this book provides the first comprehensive account of the global growth of social assistance transfers in developing countries. Armando Barrientos begins by focusing on the ethical and conceptual foundations of social assistance, and he discusses the justifications for assisting those in poverty. He provides a primer on poverty analysis, and introduces readers to the theory of optimal transfers. He then shifts the focus to practice, and introduces a classification of social assistance programmes to help readers understand the diversity in approaches and design in developing countries. The book concludes with an analysis of the financing and politics of the emerging institutions and of their potential to address global poverty.

Resistance of virulent and attenuated strains of Candida albicans to intracellular killing by human and mouse phagocytes.
Blastospores of two strains (no. 19321 and no. 19273) of Candida albicans that were obtained from patients with vaginal thrush and were virulent for mice showed no significant difference in degree of resistance to phagocytosis by human and mouse phagocytes (mostly polymorphonuclear) compared with blastospores of two strains (no. 22114 and no. 21462) that were isolated from patients with transient candidemia and were attenuated for mice. In contrast, more blastospores of the virulent strains survived intracellularly than did those of the attenuated strains over a 2-hr period, after which the surviving blastospores began to form germ tubes. Heterogeneity in the populations of blastospores was suggested, because progeny from surviving blastospores of attenuated strain no. 22114 behaved similarly to virulent strains in tests with human and mouse phagocytes and in virulence tests in mice.

Mosaic PPM1D mutations are associated with predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer.
Improved sequencing technologies offer unprecedented opportunities for investigating the role of rare genetic variation in common disease. However, there are considerable challenges with respect to study design, data analysis and replication. Using pooled next-generation sequencing of 507 genes implicated in the repair of DNA in 1,150 samples, an analytical strategy focused on protein-truncating variants (PTVs) and a large-scale sequencing case-control replication experiment in 13,642 individuals, here we show that rare PTVs in the p53-inducible protein phosphatase PPM1D are associated with predisposition to breast cancer and ovarian cancer. PPM1D PTV mutations were present in 25 out of 7,781 cases versus 1 out of 5,861 controls (P = 1.12 × 10(-5)), including 18 mutations in 6,912 individuals with breast cancer (P = 2.42 × 10(-4)) and 12 mutations in 1,121 individuals with ovarian cancer (P = 3.10 × 10(-9)). Notably, all of the identified PPM1D PTVs were mosaic in lymphocyte DNA and clustered within a 370-base-pair region in the final exon of the gene, carboxy-terminal to the phosphatase catalytic domain. Functional studies demonstrate that the mutations result in enhanced suppression of p53 in response to ionizing radiation exposure, suggesting that the mutant alleles encode hyperactive PPM1D isoforms. Thus, although the mutations cause premature protein truncation, they do not result in the simple loss-of-function effect typically associated with this class of variant, but instead probably have a gain-of-function effect. Our results have implications for the detection and management of breast and ovarian cancer risk. More generally, these data provide new insights into the role of rare and of mosaic genetic variants in common conditions, and the use of sequencing in their identification.

[mitochondrial, human, trh, hormone]

Thyrotropin-releasing hormone controls mitochondrial biology in human epidermis.
CONTEXT: Mitochondrial capacity and metabolic potential are under the control of hormones, such as thyroid hormones. The most proximal regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, TRH, is the key hypothalamic integrator of energy metabolism via its impact on thyroid hormone secretion. OBJECTIVE: Here, we asked whether TRH directly modulates mitochondrial functions in normal, TRH-receptor-positive human epidermis. METHODS: Organ-cultured human skin was treated with TRH (5-100 ng/ml) for 12-48 h. RESULTS: TRH significantly increased epidermal immunoreactivity for the mitochondria-selective subunit I of respiratory chain complex IV (MTCO1). This resulted from an increased MTCO1 transcription and protein synthesis and a stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis as demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy and TRH-enhanced mitochondrial DNA synthesis. TRH also significantly stimulated the transcription of several other mitochondrial key genes (TFAM, HSP60, and BMAL1), including the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1α). TRH significantly enhanced mitochondrial complex I and IV enzyme activity and enhanced the oxygen consumption of human skin samples, which shows that the stimulated mitochondria are fully vital because the main source for cellular oxygen consumption is mitochondrial endoxidation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings identify TRH as a potent, novel neuroendocrine stimulator of mitochondrial activity and biogenesis in human epidermal keratinocytes in situ. Thus, human epidermis offers an excellent model for dissecting neuroendocrine controls of human mitochondrial biology under physiologically relevant conditions and for exploring corresponding clinical applications.

[mrf, action, substrate, selection, cluster]

Is there a brainstem substrate for action selection?
The search for the neural substrate of vertebrate action selection has focused on structures in the forebrain and midbrain, and particularly on the group of sub-cortical nuclei known as the basal ganglia. Yet, the behavioural repertoire of decerebrate and neonatal animals suggests the existence of a relatively self-contained neural substrate for action selection in the brainstem. We propose that the medial reticular formation (mRF) is the substrate's main component and review evidence showing that the mRF's inputs, outputs and intrinsic organization are consistent with the requirements of an action-selection system. The internal architecture of the mRF is composed of interconnected neuron clusters. We present an anatomical model which suggests that the mRF's intrinsic circuitry constitutes a small-world network and extend this result to show that it may have evolved to reduce axonal wiring. Potential configurations of action representation within the internal circuitry of the mRF are then assessed by computational modelling. We present new results demonstrating that each cluster's output is most likely to represent activation of a component action; thus, coactivation of a set of these clusters would lead to the coordinated behavioural response observed in the animal. Finally, we consider the potential integration of the basal ganglia and mRF substrates for selection and suggest that they may collectively form a layered/hierarchical control system.

[carotid, blowout, treatment, patient]

Endovascular management of the carotid blowout syndrome.
Bleeding from the carotid artery or its branches ('carotid blowout') is a well recognized complication following treatment or recurrence of head and neck cancer. The traditional surgical treatment for carotid blowout is often technically difficult and is associated with an unacceptably high morbidity and mortality. The majority of such patients are currently treated conservatively with end of life supportive measures. We report the case of a young patient with recurrent supraglottic carcinoma complicated by carotid blowout on two separate occasions over a five month period, which was successfully treated endovascularly under local anaesthetic, without neurological sequelae. With the continuing development of interventional radiology, endovascular techniques are now emerging as a viable, low morbidity treatment option in selected patients.

[symptom, patient, lung, cancer, experience, cluster]

A qualitative exploration of a respiratory distress symptom cluster in lung cancer: cough, breathlessness and fatigue.
UNLABELLED: There is a growing awareness that symptoms frequently co-occur in 'symptom clusters' and that understanding these clusters may improve the management of unrelieved symptoms in patients. In-depth longitudinal exploration of lung cancer patients' symptom experiences is used to examine patient symptom experiences and distress across the disease trajectory of lung cancer. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients and their primary caregivers at four time points: at the beginning of treatment and then subsequently at three, six, and twelve months. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was employed in the data analysis. FINDINGS: Findings indicate that a cluster of interacting respiratory symptoms play a central role in patients' symptom experiences within the lung cancer population. The interviews also suggest that symptoms such as cough which are under-represented in research within this population may play an important role in patients' symptom experiences. DISCUSSION: Longitudinal qualitative investigation offers a valuable method for improving our understanding of patients' experiences of lung cancer and for identifying potential opportunities to improve patient quality of life.

Randomized Phase II Study of Dacomitinib (PF-00299804), an Irreversible Pan–Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibitor, Versus Erlotinib in Patients With Advanced Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer
PURPOSE This randomized, open-label trial compared dacomitinib (PF-00299804), an irreversible inhibitor of human epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR)/HER1, HER2, and HER4, with erlotinib, a reversible EGFR inhibitor, in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with NSCLC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2, no prior HER-directed therapy, and one/two prior chemotherapy regimens received dacomitinib 45 mg or erlotinib 150 mg once daily. Results One hundred eighty-eight patients were randomly assigned. Treatment arms were balanced for most clinical and molecular characteristics. Median progression-free survival (PFS; primary end point) was 2.86 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.91 months for patients treated with erlotinib (hazard ratio HR = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.91; two-sided P = .012); in patients with KRAS wild-type tumors, median PFS was 3.71 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.91 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.85; two-sided P = .006); and in patients with KRAS wild-type/EGFR wild-type tumors, median PFS was 2.21 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.84 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.99; two-sided P = .043). Median overall survival was 9.53 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 7.44 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.13; two-sided P = .205). Adverse event-related discontinuations were uncommon in both arms. Common treatment-related adverse events were dermatologic and gastrointestinal, predominantly grade 1 to 2, and more frequent with dacomitinib. CONCLUSION Dacomitinib demonstrated significantly improved PFS versus erlotinib, with acceptable toxicity. PFS benefit was observed in most clinical and molecular subsets, notably KRAS wild-type/EGFR any status, KRAS wild-type/EGFR wild-type, and EGFR mutants.

Polarization analysis for seeded FELs in a crossed-planar undulator
The crossed-planar undulator is a promising scheme for full polarization control in x-ray FELs. For SASE FELs, it has been shown a maximum degree of circular polarization of about 80% is achievable at fundamental wavelength just before saturation. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of a crossed undulator for a seeded x-ray FEL. The degree of circular polarization for both the fundamental and the harmonic radiation are considered. Simulations with realistic beam distributions show that a degree of over 90% and 80% is obtainable at the fundamental and 2nd harmonic frequencies, respectively.

Hereditary ovarian cancer and two-compartment tumor metabolism: epithelial loss of BRCA1 induces hydrogen peroxide production, driving oxidative stress and NFκB activation in the tumor stroma.
Mutations in the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene are commonly found in hereditary ovarian cancers. Here, we used a co-culture approach to study the metabolic effects of BRCA1-null ovarian cancer cells on adjacent tumor-associated stromal fibroblasts. Our results directly show that BRCA1-null ovarian cancer cells produce large amounts of hydrogen peroxide, which can be abolished either by administration of simple antioxidants (N-acetyl-cysteine; NAC) or by replacement of the BRCA1 gene. Thus, the BRCA1 gene normally suppresses tumor growth by functioning as an antioxidant. Importantly, hydrogen peroxide produced by BRCA1-null ovarian cancer cells induces oxidative stress and catabolic processes in adjacent stromal fibroblasts, such as autophagy, mitophagy and glycolysis, via stromal NFκB activation. Catabolism in stromal fibroblasts was also accompanied by the upregulation of MCT4 and a loss of Cav-1 expression, which are established markers of a lethal tumor microenvironment. In summary, loss of the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene induces hydrogen peroxide production, which then leads to metabolic reprogramming of the tumor stroma, driving stromal-epithelial metabolic coupling. Our results suggest that new cancer prevention trials with antioxidants are clearly warranted in patients that harbor hereditary/familial BRCA1 mutations.

GROWTH RESPONSE AND CARCASS CHARACTERISTICS OF RABBIT FED GRADED LEVELS OF Leucaena leucocephala DIETS
The growth response and carcass characteristics of rabbits fed graded levels of Laucaena leucocephala diets were studied in a complete randomized design. A total of thirty six (36) young New Zealand white rabbits were fed with diet of 0% (D1), 50% (D2) and 100% (D3) inclusion levels of L. leucocephala for six weeks. The results showed a significant difference (P&lt;0.05) in body weight gain and feed intake among the different diets. The carcass characteristics (dressing percentage) were higher in the group fed D2 than in D1 and D3 groups (52.42, 50.61 and 42.60%, respectively). The result from this study identified 50% inclusion level of L. leucocephala as feed supplement in rabbit production gives a better performance and also a means of cutting down the cost of production(since the plant is priceless) for maximum profit return. &nbsp; KEYWORDS:- Leucaena leucocephala, carcass, characteristics, rabbit, diets &nbsp;

Effects of subducted seamounts on megathrust earthquake nucleation and rupture propagation
Subducted seamounts have been linked to interplate earthquakes, but their specific effects on earthquake mechanism remain controversial. A key question is under what conditions a subducted seamount will generate or stop megathrust earthquakes. Here we show results from numerical experiments in the framework of rate- and state-dependent friction law in which a seamount is characterized as a patch of elevated effective normal stress on the thrust interface. We find that whether subducted seamounts generate or impede megathrust earthquakes depends critically on their relative locations to the earthquake nucleation zone defined by depth-variable friction parameters. A seamount may act as a rupture barrier and such barrier effect is most prominent when the seamount sits at an intermediate range of the seamount-to-trench distances (20–100% of the nucleation-zone-to-trench distance). Moreover, we observe that seamount-induced barriers can turn into asperities on which megathrust earthquakes can nucleate at shallow depths and rupture the entire seismogenic zone. These results suggest that a strong barrier patch may not necessarily reduce the maximum size of earthquakes. Instead, the barrier could experience large coseismic slip when it is ruptured.Author Posting. © American Geophysical Union, 2012.

The incidence of antibodies to maize using an immunofluorescent technique has been found to be 14% in controls, 33% in Crohn's disease, 50% in ulcerative colitis and 44% in coeliac disease. This result indicates that humoral immunity to maize is probably unimportant in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. The similar incidence of antibodies in the inflammatory bowel disease and coeliac groups suggests absorption of dietary antigen secondary to an increased mucosal permeability.

Essays on corporate capital structure and cash holdings
In this thesis, I examine several important aspects of firms’ financing processes in the G-5 countries consisting of France, Germany, Japan, the UK, and the US.First, I investigate the asymmetry in firms’ partial adjustments toward their target leverage, conditional on deviations from target leverage and financing gaps. Using the system Generalized Method of Moments, I show that the asymmetry in firms’ leverage adjustments are driven by differences in these factors. Firms adjust toward their target leverage faster when being over-levered and/or facing a financing deficit, a behavior in strong support of the dynamic trade-off theory of corporate leverage. Second, I examine whether firms’ choices of securities enable them to close out deviations from target leverage through asymmetric, logistic models that take into account both total costs of leverage adjustments (as proposed by the trade-off theory) and costs of adverse selection (as proposed by the pecking-order theory). The results suggest that even when firms’ choices of securities reflect their target adjustments as they allow them to move closer toward their target leverage, costs of adverse selection may still have some influence on these choices.Finally, I develop asymmetric, partial adjustment models to examine firms’ cash holdings adjustments. Consistent with the optimal cash holdings view, I find that firms have optimal levels of cash holdings and attempt to adjust toward these over time. Further, there is asymmetry in both their speeds and mechanisms of adjustments. Firms with above-target cash holdings adjust toward their targets faster than those with below-target cash holdings as their mechanisms of adjustments may involve relatively lower costs. They adjust mainly via changes in cash flows from financing and cash flows from investing while their counterparts adjust mainly via changes in cash flows from operating. I also document some evidence on the asymmetric impact of the magnitude of deviations from target cash holdings and factors which proxy for the levels of financial constraints on firms’ cash holdings adjustments and find that the impact of these proxies tends to be weaker than that of deviations from target cash holdings.

Degenerate human nucleus pulposus cells promote neurite outgrowth in neural cells.
Innervation of nociceptive nerve fibres into the normally aneural nucleus pulposus (NP) of the intervertebral disc (IVD) occurs during degeneration resulting in discogenic back pain. The neurotrophins nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which are associated with stimulation of axonal outgrowth and nociception by neuronal cells, are both expressed by NP cells, with BDNF levels increasing with disease severity. However the mechanism of interaction between human NP cells and neural cells has yet to be fully elucidated. Therefore the aim of this study was to determine whether non-degenerate or degenerate human NP cells inhibit or stimulate neural outgrowth and whether any outgrowth is mediated by NGF or BDNF. Human NP cells from non-degenerate and degenerate IVD were cultured in alginate beads then co-cultured for 48 hours with human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Co-culture of non-degenerate NP cells with neural cells resulted in both an inhibition of neurite outgrowth and reduction in percentage of neurite expressing cells. Conversely co-culture with degenerate NP cells resulted in an increase in both neurite length and percentage of neurite expressing cells. Addition of anti-NGF to the co-culture with degenerate cells resulted in a decrease in percentage of neurite expressing cells, while addition of anti-BDNF resulted in a decrease in both neurite length and percentage of neurite expressing cells. Our findings show that while non-degenerate NP cells are capable of inhibiting neurite outgrowth from human neural cells, degenerate NP cells stimulate outgrowth. Neurotrophin blocking studies demonstrated that both NGF and BDNF, secreted by degenerate NP cells, may play a role in this stimulation with BDNF potentially playing the predominant role. These findings suggest that NP cells are capable of regulating nerve ingrowth and that neoinnervation occurring during IVD degeneration may be stimulated by the NP cells themselves.

[endothelial, factor, cell, growth, vegf, 6-o-sulfate, fgf2]

Endothelial heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfation levels regulate angiogenic responses of endothelial cells to fibroblast growth factor 2 and vascular endothelial growth factor.
Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (VEGF(165)) are potent pro-angiogenic growth factors that play a pivotal role in tumor angiogenesis. The activity of these growth factors is regulated by heparan sulfate (HS), which is essential for the formation of FGF2/FGF receptor (FGFR) and VEGF(165)/VEGF receptor signaling complexes. However, the structural characteristics of HS that determine activation or inhibition of such complexes are only partially defined. Here we show that ovarian tumor endothelium displays high levels of HS sequences that harbor glucosamine 6-O-sulfates when compared with normal ovarian vasculature where these sequences are also detected in perivascular area. Reduced HS 6-O-sulfotransferase 1 (HS6ST-1) or 6-O-sulfotransferase 2 (HS6ST-2) expression in endothelial cells impacts upon the prevalence of HS 6-O-sulfate moieties in HS sequences, which consist of repeating short, highly sulfated S domains interspersed by transitional N-acetylated/N-sulfated domains. 1-40% reduction in 6-O-sulfates significantly compromises FGF2- and VEGF(165)-induced endothelial cell sprouting and tube formation in vitro and FGF2-dependent angiogenesis in vivo. Moreover, HS on wild-type neighboring endothelial or smooth muscle cells fails to restore endothelial cell sprouting and tube formation. The affinity of FGF2 for HS with reduced 6-O-sulfation is preserved, although FGFR1 activation is inhibited correlating with reduced receptor internalization. These data show that 6-O-sulfate moieties in endothelial HS are of major importance in regulating FGF2- and VEGF(165)-dependent endothelial cell functions in vitro and in vivo and highlight HS6ST-1 and HS6ST-2 as potential targets of novel antiangiogenic agents.

Diffraction Dissociation Contributions to Two-Nucleon Knockout Reactions and the Suppression of Shell-Model Strength
<p>The contributions to the cross sections of intermediate energy two-nucleon knockout reactions from events in which one nucleon is removed by the stripping (inelastic breakup) mechanism and a second by the diffraction (elastic breakup) mechanism are discussed. The small additional contributions from two-nucleon diffraction events are also estimated. The approach used combines the eikonal reaction and shell model structure theory frameworks. For reactions involving the removal of two well-bound like nucleons, at incident energies of order 100 MeV per nucleon, the additional cross sections are shown to be of approximately the same size as those from events in which both nucleons are stripped in inelastic interactions. These more complete dynamical calculations now permit a quantitative comparison of the theoretical cross sections with recent partial cross-section measurements of the two-neutron (two-proton) removal reactions from neutron-deficient (neutron-rich) nuclei. As has been observed in both nuclear- and electron-induced single-nucleon knockout reaction analyses, the theoretical two-nucleon knockout cross sections overestimate the measured values, requiring a suppression of the two nucleon shell-model transition strengths. The deduced two-nucleon suppression factors, R-s(2N), are consistent with a value of 0.5 for each of the five reactions considered.</p>

Caveolin-1 and accelerated host aging in the breast tumor microenvironment: chemoprevention with rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor and anti-aging drug.
Increasing chronological age is the most significant risk factor for human cancer development. To examine the effects of host aging on mammary tumor growth, we used caveolin (Cav)-1 knockout mice as a bona fide model of accelerated host aging. Mammary tumor cells were orthotopically implanted into these distinct microenvironments (Cav-1(+/+) versus Cav-1(-/-) age-matched young female mice). Mammary tumors grown in a Cav-1-deficient tumor microenvironment have an increased stromal content, with vimentin-positive myofibroblasts (a marker associated with oxidative stress) that are also positive for S6-kinase activation (a marker associated with aging). Mammary tumors grown in a Cav-1-deficient tumor microenvironment were more than fivefold larger than tumors grown in a wild-type microenvironment. Thus, a Cav-1-deficient tumor microenvironment provides a fertile soil for breast cancer tumor growth. Interestingly, the mammary tumor-promoting effects of a Cav-1-deficient microenvironment were estrogen and progesterone independent. In this context, chemoprevention was achieved by using the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor and anti-aging drug, rapamycin. Systemic rapamycin treatment of mammary tumors grown in a Cav-1-deficient microenvironment significantly inhibited their tumor growth, decreased their stromal content, and reduced the levels of both vimentin and phospho-S6 in Cav-1-deficient cancer-associated fibroblasts. Since stromal loss of Cav-1 is a marker of a lethal tumor microenvironment in breast tumors, these high-risk patients might benefit from treatment with mTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin or other rapamycin-related compounds (rapalogues).

Prognosticating in patients with advanced cancer--observational study comparing the accuracy of clinicians' and patients' estimates of survival.
BackgroundClinicians' prognoses in patients with advanced cancer are imprecise. The aim of this study was to compare doctors', nurses' and patients' survival predictions and to identify factors which influence accuracy.Patients and methodsSome 1018 patients with advanced cancer were recruited. Survival estimates were obtained from the attending doctor, nurse, multidisciplinary team (MDT) and patient (n = 829, 954, 987 and 290 estimates, respectively) and were compared with actual survival. Clinician and patient characteristics were recorded.ResultsMDTs', doctors' and nurses' predictions were accurate 57.5%, 56.3% and 55.5% of occasions, respectively. Nurses were less accurate than the MDT (P = 0.007) but were no worse than doctors (P = 0.284). Estimates of clinicians and patients were more optimistic (doctors: 31%; nurses: 34%; MDT: 31.1%; patients: 45.1%) than pessimistic (12.7%, 11%, 11.4% and 2.7%). Nurses' accuracy increased if they had reviewed the patient within 24 h. Most patients (61.4%) wanted to know their prognosis. Only 37.1% were willing to offer an estimate regarding their own survival. Patients' prognostic estimates were less accurate than health care professionals' (P < 0.001).ConclusionsMDTs were better at predicting survival than doctors' or nurses' alone. Patients were substantially worse. Among nurses, recency of review was related to improved prognostic accuracy.

Metabolic remodeling of the tumor microenvironment: migration stimulating factor (MSF) reprograms myofibroblasts toward lactate production, fueling anabolic tumor growth.
Migration stimulating factor (MSF) is a genetically truncated N-terminal isoform of fibronectin that is highly expressed during mammalian development in fetal fibroblasts, and during tumor formation in human cancer-associated myofibroblasts. However, its potential functional role in regulating tumor metabolism remains unexplored. Here, we generated an immortalized fibroblast cell line that recombinantly overexpresses MSF and studied their properties relative to vector-alone control fibroblasts. Our results indicate that overexpression of MSF is sufficient to confer myofibroblastic differentiation, likely via increased TGF-b signaling. In addition, MSF activates the inflammation-associated transcription factor NFκB, resulting in the onset of autophagy/mitophagy, thereby driving glycolytic metabolism (L-lactate production) in the tumor microenvironment. Consistent with the idea that glycolytic fibroblasts fuel tumor growth (via L-lactate, a high-energy mitochondrial fuel), MSF fibroblasts significantly increased tumor growth, by up to 4-fold. Mechanistic dissection of the MSF signaling pathway indicated that Cdc42 lies downstream of MSF and fibroblast activation. In accordance with this notion, Cdc42 overexpression in immortalized fibroblasts was sufficient to drive myofibroblast differentiation, to provoke a shift towards glycolytic metabolism and to promote tumor growth by up to 2-fold. In conclusion, the MSF/Cdc42/NFκB signaling cascade may be a critical druggable target in preventing "Warburg-like" cancer metabolism in tumor-associated fibroblasts. Thus, MSF functions in the metabolic remodeling of the tumor microenvironment by metabolically reprogramming cancer-associated fibroblasts toward glycolytic metabolism.

Interaction of Metals with suspended Graphene observed by Transmission Electron Microscopy
In this Perspective, we present an overview of how different metals interface with suspended graphene, providing a closer look into the metal–graphene interaction by employing high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, especially using high-angle dark field imaging. All studied metals favor sites on the omnipresent hydrocarbon surface contamination rather than on the clean graphene surface and present nonuniform distributions, which never result in continuous films but instead in clusters or nanocrystals, indicating a weak interaction between the metal and graphene. This behavior can be altered to some degree by surface pretreatment (hydrogenation) and high-temperature vacuum annealing. Graphene etching is observed in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) under high vacuum and 60 kV electron beam acceleration voltage conditions for all metals, except for Au. This unusual metal-mediated etching sheds new light on the metal–graphene interaction; it might explain the observed higher frequency of cluster nucleation for certain transition metals and might have implications regarding controlled nanomanipulation, that is, for self-assembly and sculpturing of future graphene-based devices.

[mmp3, nfkappab, allele, polymorphism, effect]

Allele-specific regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-3 gene by transcription factor NFkappaB.
BACKGROUND: Matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3) is implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of atherosclerotic lesions. Previous studies suggested that MMP3 expression is influenced by a polymorphism (known as the 5A/6A polymorphism) in the promoter of the MMP3 gene and that this polymorphism is located within a cis-element that interacts with the transcription factor NFkappaB. In the present study, we sought to investigate whether MMP3 and NFkappaB were co-localized in atherosclerotic lesions and whether NFkappaB had differential effects on the two alleles of the MMP3 5A/6A polymorphism. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Immunohistochemical examination showed that MMP3 and both the NFkappaB p50 and p65 subunits were expressed abundantly in macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions and that MMP3 expression was co-localized with p50 and p65. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed interaction of p50 and p65 with the MMP3 promoter in macrophages, with greater binding to the 5A allele than to the 6A allele. Reporter gene assays in transiently transfected macrophages showed that the 5A allele had greater transcriptional activity than the 6A allele, and that this allele-specific effect was augmented when the cells were treated with the NFkappaB activator lipopolysaccharides or co-transfected with p50 and/or p65 expressing plasmids, but was reduced when the cells were treated with the NFkappaB inhibitor 6-Amino-4-(4-phenoxyphenylethylamino)-quinazoline or transfected with a dominant negative mutant of IkB kinase-beta. CONCLUSION: These results corroborate an effect of the 5A/6A polymorphism on MMP3 transcription and indicate that NFkappaB has differential effects on the 5A and 6A alleles.

Rotation Intervals for Quasi-Periodically Forced Circle Maps
This work investigates some aspects of the dynamics of non-invertible quasi-periodic circle maps, from the point of view of rotation numbers and their structurein parameter space.Circle maps and quasi-periodically forced circle maps have been widely used asa model for a broad range of physical phenomena. From the mathematical point ofview they have also received considerable attention because of the many interestingfeatures they exhibit.The system used is given by the mapsx_n   =  x_n-1 + a + b/2pi sin(2pi x_n-1) + c sin(2 theta_n-1)     mod 1theta_n   =   theta_n-1 + omega    mod 1where a, b and c are real constants. In addition, b and omega are restricted, respectively, to values larger than one and irrational.A fundamental part of this thesis consists of numerical approximations of rotationintervals using and adapting of the work of Boyland (1986) to the quasi-periodic case.Particular emphasis was given to the case of large coupling strength in quasi-periodic forcing.Examination of the computed rotation numbers for the large coupling case, together with previous claims suggesting that for large coupling strength the b-termcould be neglected (see Ding (1989)), led to the formulation of an ergodic argumentwhich is statistically supported. This argument indicates that, for this case, thequalitative behaviour of rotation number depends linearly on a. It is also shown thatthe length of the rotation interval, when the transition from a trivial rotation interval (invertible case) to a non-trivial rotation interval occurs, it develops locally as auniversal unfolding.A different map, piecewise monotone, and structurally similar to the maps definedto calculate the edges of rotation intervals in Boyland (1986), is studied to illustratehow the rotation number grows. The edges of rotation intervals are analyticallycalculated and matched with numerical observations.

Respiratory syncytial virus infection provokes airway remodelling in allergen-exposed mice in absence of prior allergen sensitization.
BACKGROUND: The mechanisms underlying exacerbation of asthma induced by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection have been extensively studied in human and animal models. However, most of these studies focused on acute inflammation and little is known of its long-term consequences on remodelling of the airway tissue. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to use a murine model of prolonged allergen-induced airway inflammation to investigate the effect of RSV infection on allergic airway inflammation and tissue remodelling. METHODS: We subjected mice to RSV infection before or during the chronic phase of airway challenges with OVA and compared parameters of airway inflammation and remodelling at the end-point of the prolonged allergen-induced airway inflammation protocol. RESULTS: RSV infection did not affect the severity of airway inflammation in any of the groups studied. However, RSV infection provoked airway remodelling in non-sensitized, allergen-challenged mice that did not otherwise develop any of the features of allergic airways disease. Increased collagen synthesis in the lung and thickening of the bronchial basal membrane was observed in non-sensitized allergen-challenged mice only after prior RSV infection. In addition, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 but not TGF-beta(1) was increased in this group following RSV infection. CONCLUSION: Our data show for the first time that RSV infection can prime the lung of mice that are not previously systemically sensitized, to develop airway remodelling in response to allergen upon sole exposure via the airways. Moreover, our results implicate RSV-induced FGF-2 in the remodelling process in vivo.

The binding site of NK receptors on HLA-C molecules.
The protection of cells expressing class I HLA molecules from NK lysis is mediated by natural killer cell inhibitory receptors (NKIR). Using site-directed mutagenesis, residues on HLA-C that determine the locus specificity (alphaVal-76), allotype group specificity (a dimorphism alphaAsn-80/Lys-80), and affinity of NKIR binding (a second pair of dimorphisms, alphaAla-73, Asp-90 or alphaThr-73, Ala-90) have been identified. Thus the "footprint" of the NKIR on the alpha1 helix of the class I MHC molecule HLA-C and its associated beta strands are similar in position to the site occupied by superantigens on and behind the alpha1 helix of the class II MHC molecule HLA-DR1, but further toward its C-terminus. The intermediate affinity binding of NKIR to HLA-C, determined by alpha73 and alpha90, has an essential role in preventing cross-reactivity and ensuring the availability of NK cells for immunosurveillance; low affinity and high affinity mutants are both physiologically impaired.

Systems biology approach to understanding hepatic glutathione metabolism and its biomarkers of depletion
Drug induced liver injury is a leading cause of human illness and a major cause of drug withdrawals from the market. A systems biology approach has the potential to aid toxicology research since toxicological responses are a consequence of multiple non-linear and interdependent biological responses. Here such an approach is developed.The glutathione pathway is a key hepatic defence mechanism and deactivates reactive metabolites before they have the chance to damage cellular proteins. However, glutathione availability is limited and can vary between individuals. As hepatic glutathione levels cannot be measured directly, two serum-based biomarkers, i.e. 5-oxoproline and ophthalmic acid, have been proposed in literature as a means of tracking glutathione depletion. This thesis aims to test the reliability of the correlation between biomarker concentration and decreasing glutathione concentration.In this study a spiral between experiments, model predictions and falsifications, model improvement, and experimental design is described. Using this approach a kinetic model of the hepatic glutathione pathway and biomarker metabolism was constructed and subsequently expanded by adding physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models of paracetamol and the proposed biomarkers. These models have increased the understanding of the glutathione pathway. For example, the model predicted that Glutamyl-Cysteine Synthetase induction should be a highly effective way to increase the robustness of the liver to a paracetamol challenge.In addition, it was possible to qualify with increasing precision, the correlation between biomarkers and hepatic glutathione depletion. 5-Oxoproline and ophthalmic acid provide different information about the status of the glutathione pathway. 5-Oxoproline is correlated with paracetamol-glutathione conjugate formation, but not with extreme toxicity. Ophthalmic acid is a biomarker of a more advanced stage of toxicity, where the cell is unable to protect against glutathione depletion. However, care must be taken when inferring hepatic glutathione concentration. Both models demonstrate that the sensitivity of biomarkers to exposure of paracetamol, depends on the dynamics of exposure as well as on the concentrations of intracellular metabolites, such as methionine.I discuss how the methodology of biomarker assessment could be personalised with regards to individual patients and how systems toxicology could be further developed towards reliable tools for the pharmaceutical industry.

A Novel Bioresorbable Construct for Tendon Regeneration
A Novel Bioresorbable Construct for Tendon RegenerationLucy Bosworth 1,*, Sandra Downes 11 School of Materials, University of Manchester, Grosvenor Street, Manchester, M1 * lucy.bosworth@manchester.ac.ukIntroduction: Tendons are highly organised structures, which are principally composed of aligned collagen type I fibres (extracellular matrix (ECM)) that lie parallel to the tendon axis 1.  Their hierarchical configuration is established on the grouping of these fibres into bundles of increasing size to form the overall tendon structure.  The main cell type is tenocytes; these are located amongst the collagen fibres in a columnar array and are responsible for ECM production and regulation 2.  Tendons are commonly affected by injury and degenerative diseases, leading to chronic pain and spontaneous rupture.  The rate of these tendinopathies is increasing, mostly due to population aging and an increased participation in sporting and recreational activities 3.  A poor healing response, whereby scar tissue formation is organisationally, biochemically and biomechanically inferior, leaves tendons prone to further morbidity and risk of rupture.  Current interventions often have a poor outcome, resulting in loss of function, further degeneration and rupture 4,5.  Surgery involving autografts and allografts can cause additional morbidity and tissue rejection respectively 6.  There is no commercially approved synthetic, biodegradable repair device available for clinical use.  Using electrospinning, we have developed a technique that enables fabrication of bioresorbable nanofibres, which can be purposefully oriented and manipulated to create 3D scaffolds that mimic the tendon hierarchical structure.  Materials and Methods: Electrospinning parameters: voltage - 20kV, flow rate - 0.05ml/min, distance to collector ??? 15cm.  Solution properties: polymer ??? polycaprolactone (PCL) Mn 80,000, concentration 10%w/v (PCL/acetone).  Fibres were collected on a fine edged rotating mandrel.  Mandrel rotation speeds varied depending on the fibre orientation required; randomly oriented fibres 50RPM and aligned fibres 500RPM.  3D bundles were developed from manipulation of the collected aligned fibres.  Cellular interactions with fibrous scaffolds were investigated over a two-week period to determine the effects of material contact guidance on cell morphology.  This was assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  The mechanical properties of the fibrous scaffolds were also investigated to determine the tensile strength of the scaffolds investigated.  This was achieved by loading the samples to failure using an Instron with 1N load cell and 5mm/min crosshead speed.Results and Conclusions: The fibrous scaffolds conferred contact guidance to the seeded tenocytes, which could be visually assessed from SEM micrographs.  Cells cultured on both the aligned fibres and 3D bundles demonstrated cell alignment parallel to the fibres??? orientation; whereas randomly oriented fibres resulted in cells??? spreading over the fibres in varying directions.  These results demonstrate a need for appropriate scaffold biomimicry when aiming to recreate the cells??? natural environment.  Mechanical loading of the scaffolds demonstrated 3D bundles (Modulus 9.05(??2.55)MPa; Tensile strength 3.32(??0.67)MPa) to have superior tensile properties compared to aligned (Modulus 4.84(??0.13)MPa; Tensile strength 1.30(??0.14)MPa) and random (Modulus 1.54(??0.26)MPa; Tensile strength 0.45(??0.09)MPa) fibrous scaffolds.  The data highlights a clear difference in tensile properties depending on fibre orientation and whether the scaffold is a 2D fibrous mat or 3D fibrous bundle.    We have developed a technique to electrospin aligned, degradable 3D nanofibrous scaffolds, which mimic the morphology of natural tendon and stimulate tendon cells to secrete new tissue of appropriate organisation and composition.References1 Sharma P, et al.

[boundary, layer, abyssal, topography]

Boundary layer dynamics and deep ocean mixing in Mid-Atlantic Ridge canyons
Physical oceanographers have known for several decades the total amount of abyssal mixing
and upwelling required to balance the deep-water formation, but are still working to
understand the mechanisms and locations—how and where it happens. From observational
studies, we know that areas of rough topography are important and the hundreds of
Grand-Canyon sized canyons that line mid-ocean ridges have particularly energetic mixing.
To better understand the mechanisms by which rough topography translates into energetic
currents and mixing, I studied diffusive boundary layers over varying topography using
theoretical approaches and idealized numerical simulations using the ROMS model. In this
dissertation, I show a variety of previously unidentified characteristics of diffusive boundary
layers that are likely relevant for understanding the circulation of the abyssal ocean.
These boundary layers share many important properties with observed flows in abyssal
canyons, like increased kinetic energy near topographic sills and strong currents running
from the abyssal plains up the slopes of the mid-ocean ridges toward their crests. They also
have a previously unknown capacity to accelerate into overflows for a variety of oceanographically
relevant shapes and sizes of topography. This acceleration happens without
external forcing, meaning such overflows may be ubiquitous in the deep ocean. These
boundary layers also can force exchange of large volumes of fluid between the relatively
unstratified boundary layer and the stratified far-field fluid, altering the stratification far
from the boundary. We see these effects in boundary layers in two– and three–dimensions,
with and without rotation.
In conclusion, these boundary layer processes, though previously neglected, may be
a source of a dynamically important amount of abyssal upwelling, profoundly affecting
predictions of the basin-scale circulation. This type of mechanism cannot be captured by
the kind of mixing parameterizations used in current global climate models, based on a
bottom roughness. Therefore, there is much work still to do to better understand how
these boundary layers behave in more realistic contexts and how we might incorporate that
understanding into climate models.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution February 2013I gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship

Extensive self-harm scarring: successful treatment with simultaneous use of a single layer skin substitute and split-thickness skin graft.
Objective: Deliberate self-harm resulting in extensive skin scarring is a difficult clinical problem and is commonly associated with physical and sexual abuse or a known history of mental illness. Immediate hospital attendance often addresses the acute wound and current psychological state of patients; however, ongoing regret of these resulting scars present a problem to the patient and clinician. Deliberate self-harm to the skin leaves permanent and socially unacceptable scars in anatomically conspicuous areas and recognizable to others. Therefore, the aim was to offer a treatment to change these scars to that of an unknown entity. Methods: Six patients with extensive linear scars covering most of the forearm received surgical reconstruction. Patients were female aged between 18 and 47 years. Each patient had a history of psychosocial problems, and each had undergone psychiatric treatment. After an in-depth consultation and a further clinical psychological assessment, each individual was deemed suitable for reconstructive surgery. Scars were excised from the forearm en block, removing the majority of the affected area. Simultaneous use of a single layer skin substitute was used, covered by an autologous split-thickness skin graft. Negative pressure wound therapy was then applied immediately for 2 weeks after surgery. Results: The original scars were successfully converted to a socially and cosmetically acceptable appearance. Postoperative infection due to negative pressure wound therapy failure in one patient was the only complication reported. Conclusions: This case series highlights the utility of an innovative treatment for patients with DSH scarring resulting in aesthetic, psychological, and functional benefits.

[dc, skin, response, immune, cell, cutaneous, assay, dc-based, use, function]

Dendritic cells and the assessment in vitro of skin sensitizing potential.
It is now well established that dendritic cells (DC) play pivotal roles in the initiation and orchestration of adaptive immune responses, including cutaneous immune responses to chemical allergens that drive the acquisition of skin sensitization. It is not unexpected, therefore, that a large number, and wide variety, of proposed approaches for the identification of skin sensitizing chemicals in vitro are based upon the use of cultured DC or DC-like cells. The use of DC in this context is legitimate. However, with our rapidly increasing understanding of the diversity of cutaneous DC with respect to both phenotype and function, it is timely now to review briefly the potential limitations and interpretive difficulties that are associated with the use of DC-based assays. Among the important considerations are the fact that chemical-induced changes in the characteristics and function of cultured DC will not necessarily reflect accurately the events that that support the development of skin sensitization in vivo. In addition, most DC-based assays are predicated on a view that cutaneous DC have as their primary function the initiation of adaptive immune responses. However, it is now appreciated that cutaneous DC, and in particular epidermal Langerhans cells (LC), may also play important immunoregulatory roles that serve to limit and contain skin immune responses. Notwithstanding these considerations there is reason to believe that at least some in vitro DC-based assays are of value, and indeed some are currently the subject of a formal validation process. However, it is appropriate that such assays are configured and interpreted carefully, and with an appreciation of the complexity of DC biology.

Crossing borders and industry sectors: Behavioral governance in strategic alliances and product innovation for competitive advantage
This paper investigates governance mechanisms in international technology alliances (ITAs), firm-level innovation capabilities, and performance outcomes in the mobile computing market. This high-tech market is characterized by numerous cross-border strategic technology collaborations between software and hardware firms. Anchoring our work in interfirm governance theories and the resource-based view, we develop a model and empirically test relationships related to behavioral governance mechanisms, innovation capabilities, and business performance. In the cross-industry and cross-border context, the empirical model explains to what extent complementary strategic resources, through a relational governance mechanism, contribute to the innovation capabilities of high-tech firms, providing competitive advantage. The data, analyzed using partial least squares (PLS) path modeling, indicates that technological commitment is a factor in expediting technology resource exchange in ITAs between heterogeneous firms. Technological commitment is captured by the extent to which a focal firm commits to investing its technology resources in an ITA to maintain the relationship. The results also show that firm-level performance is only influenced by market development capability, and not new product development capability, in product innovation. However, we did not find any significant moderating effects of firm size and industry type on the model. This paper offers insights into how high-tech firms benefit from interfirm governance in international technology resource exchange arrangements. Furthermore, it provides evidence of the methodological usefulness of PLS path modeling in strategic alliance, capability and performance research.

Association of Cerebral Emboli With Accelerated Cognitive Deterioration in Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Dementia
OBJECTIVE: Spontaneous cerebral emboli occur frequently in patients with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. The authors investigated the effect of cerebral emboli on cognitive and functional decline in both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia patients over a 2-year period. METHOD: Cerebral emboli entering the middle cerebral arteries were counted at baseline and every 6 months over the following 18 months using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography in 144 patients with dementia (Alzheimer's disease, N=84; vascular dementia, N=60). Deterioration in cognition was measured every 6 months over 2 years using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog), the Mini-Mental State Examination (to assess cognition), the Interview for Deterioration in Daily Living Activities in Dementia (to assess function), and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (to assess behavioral and psychological symptoms). The relationship between cerebral emboli and progression of dementia was analyzed using longitudinal regression modeling, adjusted for age, sex, diagnostic subtype, age at onset of dementia, and significant vascular risk factors. RESULTS: Spontaneous cerebral emboli were detected in 63 (44%) dementia patients, 36 (43%) Alzheimer's disease patients, and 27 (45%) vascular dementia patients. ADAS-Cog scores revealed faster deterioration in cognitive functioning in patients with cerebral emboli over 2 years, with a mean increase in score of 15.4 in these patients, compared with only 6.0 for those without cerebral emboli. Similarly, Interview for Deterioration in Daily Living Activities in Dementia scores revealed more rapid deterioration in those with cerebral emboli, with a mean increase in score of 59.0 in these patients, compared with 17.9 for those without cerebral emboli. Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores also indicated faster decline in patients with cerebral emboli, with a mean increase in score of 12.0 in these patients, compared with a mean decrease in score of -3.8 for patients in whom no emboli were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous cerebral emboli predict more rapid progression of dementia over 2 years in both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Clinical trials on the inhibition of cerebral emboli in the prevention and treatment of dementia are needed.

Future sources of polarised positrons
Polarised positrons have a range of applications in modern physics: from surface science measurements requiring energies as low as a few eV, to studies of the proton structure function and of the fundamental interactions of elementary particles at energies approaching the TeV scale. The common challenge for all of these studies is to generate sufficient numbers of positrons. A discussion of this topic is pertinent to these proceedings as it has been suggested that anti-protons can be efficiently polarised through a hyperfine spin-flip interaction with polarised positrons. In this paper I review the current state of high-intensity sources of polarised positrons. Emphasis is placed on those sources being developed to meet the requirements of future electron-positron colliders.

[pf-4, monocyte, macrophage, burst, cell]

Platelet factor 4/CXCL4 induces phagocytosis and the generation of reactive oxygen metabolites in mononuclear phagocytes independently of Gi protein activation or intracellular calcium transients.
Platelet factor 4 (PF-4), a platelet-derived CXC chemokine, is known to prevent human monocytes from apoptosis and to promote differentiation of these cells into HLA-DR(-) macrophages. In this study, we investigated the role of PF-4 in the control of acute monocyte proinflammatory responses involved in the direct combat of microbial invaders. We show that PF-4 increases monocyte phagocytosis and provokes a strong formation of oxygen radicals but lacks a chemotactic activity in these cells. Compared with FMLP, PF-4-induced oxidative burst was later in its onset but was remarkably longer in its duration (lasting for up to 60 min). Furthermore, in PF-4-prestimulated cells, FMLP- as well as RANTES-induced burst responses became synergistically enhanced. As we could show, PF-4-mediated oxidative burst in monocytes does not involve Gi proteins, elevation of intracellular free calcium concentrations, or binding to CXCR3B, a novel PF-4 receptor recently discovered on endothelial cells. Moreover, we found that PF-4 acts on macrophages in a dual manner. On the one hand, very similar to GM-CSF or M-CSF, PF-4 treatment of monocytes generates macrophages with a high capacity for unspecific phagocytosis. On the other hand, short term priming of GM-CSF-induced human macrophages with PF-4 substantially increases their capability for particle ingestion and oxidative burst. A comparable effect was also observed in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages, indicating cross-reactivity of human PF-4 between both species. Taken together, PF-4 may play a crucial role in the induction and maintenance of an unspecific immune response.

Proneness to Decreased Negative Emotions in Major Depressive Disorder when Blaming Others rather than Oneself
Background: One widespread view holds that vulnerability to major depressive disorder (MDD) is linked to overall increases in negative emotionality. In contrast, cognitive attribution theories emphasize the importance of blaming oneself rather than others for negative events. Thus far, the contrasting predictions of these models have not been directly compared. Following the attributional perspective, we tested the hypothesis that people with remitted MDD show no overall bias towards negative emotions, but a selective bias towards self-blaming emotions relative to those emotions associated with blaming others. Sampling and Methods:We compared a remitted MDD and a control group on a novel experimental test that allowed us to directly compare proneness to specific emotions associated with different types of self-blame (guilt, shame, self-contempt/disgust) and blame of others (other-indignation/anger, other-contempt/disgust) whilst controlling for negative valence and medication status, and excluding comorbidity. Results: Inagreement with our hypothesis, individuals with remitted MDD exhibited an increased self-contempt bias (difference between contempt/disgust towards self and others) but no increased proneness to any other negative emotion or overallincreases in perceived negative valence of stimuli. Moreover, the remitted MDD group exhibited reduced contempt/disgust towards others. Conclusions: Our results corroborate the prediction that vulnerability to MDD is associatedwith an imbalance of specific self- and other-blaming emotions rather than a general increase in negative emotions. Based on the composition of our sample, we speculate that self-contempt bias may be particularly characteristic of melancholic MDD subtypes and could be useful for stratification of depression in the future.

Study of the current stressing in nanomanipulated three-dimensional carbon nanotube structures
<p>We report the fabrication of free-standing carbon nanotube structures. The welding of individual carbon nanotubes to other nanotubes and metal substrates has been performed, on a selective basis, to produce joints of both good electrical conductivity and mechanical integrity, without the need for a joining material. As a result of this unique process, we study the damage to the microstructure of the nanotube as a function of current. When the current densities are in excess of 2 x 10(6) A/cm(2), particular care must be taken with regard to the quality of the nanotube and the heat dissipation. This is crucial for the use and application of nanotubes in any future device structure for it gives the upper limits to the "average" current density calculations. This process now allows for the fabrication of bespoke carbon nanotube devices for the prototyping of device performance.</p>

Collaborative care for depression and anxiety problems.
BACKGROUND: Common mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, are estimated to affect up to 15% of the UK population at any one time, and health care systems worldwide need to implement interventions to reduce the impact and burden of these conditions. Collaborative care is a complex intervention based on chronic disease management models that may be effective in the management of these common mental health problems. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of collaborative care for patients with depression or anxiety. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases to February 2012: The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) trials registers (CCDANCTR-References and CCDANCTR-Studies) which include relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from MEDLINE (1950 to present), EMBASE (1974 to present), PsycINFO (1967 to present) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, all years); the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP); ClinicalTrials.gov; and CINAHL (to November 2010 only). We screened the reference lists of reports of all included studies and published systematic reviews for reports of additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of collaborative care for participants of all ages with depression or anxiety. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent researchers extracted data using a standardised data extraction sheet. Two independent researchers made 'Risk of bias' assessments using criteria from The Cochrane Collaboration. We combined continuous measures of outcome using standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We combined dichotomous measures using risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs. Sensitivity analyses tested the robustness of the results. MAIN RESULTS: We included seventy-nine RCTs (including 90 relevant comparisons) involving 24,308 participants in the review. Studies varied in terms of risk of bias.The results of primary analyses demonstrated significantly greater improvement in depression outcomes for adults with depression treated with the collaborative care model in the short-term (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.27; RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.43), medium-term (SMD -0.28, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.15; RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.48), and long-term (SMD -0.35, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.24; RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.41). However, these significant benefits were not demonstrated into the very long-term (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.27).The results also demonstrated significantly greater improvement in anxiety outcomes for adults with anxiety treated with the collaborative care model in the short-term (SMD -0.30, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.17; RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.87), medium-term (SMD -0.33, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.19; RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.69), and long-term (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.06; RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.42). No comparisons examined the effects of the intervention on anxiety outcomes in the very long-term.There was evidence of benefit in secondary outcomes including medication use, mental health quality of life, and patient satisfaction, although there was less evidence of benefit in physical quality of life. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Collaborative care is associated with significant improvement in depression and anxiety outcomes compared with usual care, and represents a useful addition to clinical pathways for adult patients with depression and anxiety.

Digital watermarking of still images
This thesis presents novel research work on copyright protection of grey scale and colour digital images. New blind frequency domain watermarking algorithms using one dimensional and two dimensional Walsh coding were developed. Handwritten signatures and mobile phone numbers were used in this project as watermarks. In this research eight algorithms were developed based on the DCT using 1D and 2D Walsh coding. These algorithms used the low frequency coefficients of the 8 × 8 DCT blocks for embedding. A shuffle process was used in the watermarking algorithms to increase the robustness against the cropping attacks. All algorithms are blind since they do not require original image. All algorithms caused minimum distortion to the host images and the watermarking is invisible. The watermark is embedded in the green channel of the RGB colour images. The Walsh coded watermark is inserted several times by using the shuffling process to improve its robustness. The effect of changing the Walsh lengths and the scaling strength of the watermark on the robustness and image quality were studied. All algorithms are examined by using several grey scale and colour images of sizes 512 × 512. The fidelity of the images was assessed by using the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), the structural similarity index measure (SSIM), normalized correlation (NC) and StirMark benchmark tools. The new algorithms were tested on several grey scale and colour images of different sizes. Evaluation techniques using several tools with different scaling factors have been considered in the thesis to assess the algorithms. The results have shown that use of 1D and 2D Walsh coding with DCT Blocks offers significant improvement in the robustness against JPEG compression and some other image processing operations compared to the method of embedding without coding.

[gp, suicide, consultation, patient, case, care, practice, interview, general, risk]

Primary care contact prior to suicide in individuals with mental illness.
BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported differing rates of consultation with GPs prior to suicide. Patients with a psychiatric history have higher rates of consultation and consult closer to the time of their death. AIM: To investigate the frequency and nature of general practice consultations in the year before suicide for patients in current, or recent, contact with secondary mental health services. DESIGN OF STUDY: Retrospective case-note study and semi-structured interviews. SETTING: General practices in the northwest of England. METHOD: General practice data were obtained by a retrospective review of medical records (n = 247) and semi-structured interviews with GPs (n = 159). RESULTS: GP records were reviewed in 247 of the 286 cases (86%). Overall, 91% of individuals (n = 224) consulted their GP on at least one occasion in the year before death. The median number of consultations was 7 (interquartile range = 3-10). Interviews were carried out with GPs with regard to 159 patients. GPs reported concerns about their patient's safety in 43 (27%) cases, but only 16% of them thought that the suicide could have been prevented. Agreement between GPs and mental health teams regarding risk of suicide was poor. Both sets of clinicians rated moderate to high levels of risk in only 3% of cases for whom information was available (n = 139) (overall kappa = 0.024). CONCLUSION: Consultation prior to suicide is common but suicide prevention in primary care is challenging. Possible strategies might include examining the potential benefits of risk assessment and collaborative working between primary and secondary care.

[heparanome, microsecond, puckering, sequence]

Does microsecond sugar ring flexing encode 3D-shape and bioactivity in the heparanome?
The biological information encoded in carbohydrate sequences dwarfs that of proteins and nucleic acids. Deciphering structure-function relationships in heparin and heparan sulfate (the heparanome) is further compounded by extreme sequence diversity, experimental difficulties and the computational cost of rigorous modeling. Here, we perform unbiased microsecond dynamics simulations of 11 heparanome oligosaccharides (55 microseconds total) to investigate the effect of sequence on 3D-structure and to underpin a coarse-grained model that is consistent with long-timescale experimentally-validated atomic motions in water. Pyranose ring flexing (puckering) in 2-O-sulfo-Î±-L-iduronic acid, which underlies heparin-mediated anticoagulation, was modulated by polymerization (chain position and adjacent residues), which is supported by previous experiments. Furthermore, in coarse-grained simulations inclusion of puckering was essential to predict macroscopic hydrodynamic properties of heparan sulfate chains containing hundreds of monosaccharaides. Our structural findings and model enable rational molecular design and we propose that in the heparanome, puckering, polymer 3D-shape and bioactivity are inextricably linked.

Connective action for regeneration: A comparative case study of social networks andcommunity infrastructure in New East Manchester
This study explores the mechanisms underpinning policy efforts to build community indeprived urban neighbourhoods using a mixed-method comparative case study. Twoneighbourhoods within the New East Manchester (NEM) urban regeneration area areexamined, one of which hosted a New Deal for Communities (NDC) regenerationpartnership from 1999-2010. In 2009 the NDC successor body established a communityforum in each neighbourhood in an attempt to sustain and extend NDC’s participatorypractices. The study compares the community infrastructure embodied by the residents’groups eligible to participate in the forum in each neighbourhood. Social networks data,standard survey metrics and ethnographic material on 61 groups were collected. Theseelucidate the structure of groups’ relations, their collective action capacity and the extentto which NDC, and its successor, NEM, were implicated in the formation and developmentof these relations.NDC was the most prominent expression of the New Labour’s social capital-orientated“turn to community” (Duffy and Hutchinson, 1997). However, the final national evaluationof the scheme raised doubts about its impact, finding little effect on community relations atthe neighbourhood level (CLG, 2010c). This gap between policy ambition and outcome isprobed in this study using new tools and employing concepts from the social movements’literature, rather than the social capital framework underpinning most existing research onNDC. It focusses specifically social relations as a metric of community infrastructure, butresists the network analytic tendency to infer community from the mere presence ofrelations (Blokland, 2003). Instead it seeks evidence of the capacity for pairwise ties to betranslated into communal mobilization through the interplay of relational, cognitive andcontextual mechanisms, including specific facets of the political opportunity structures(POS) of NDC. The study contributes to debates on policy, theory and method relevant to:the practice of civic engagement and community development in regeneration; thesociology of community in deprived post-industrial neighbourhoods; and the measurementof community capacity and collective agency.Analysis of social networks considers three levels: the connection of individual residentsto each group; relations between groups within the neighbourhood; and relations betweengroups and local service-providers. Results show very similar levels of networkconnectivity in the two neighbourhoods, but greater evidence of the growth of sustainablegrassroots organising and leadership capacity in the non-NDC area. Quantitative andqualitative analysis of POS concludes that NDC was instrumental in generating aconstrained, controllable form of community engagement to meet the deliveryrequirements of the scheme. This process stifled the development of a wider, independentself-organising capacity on the ground, sustainable beyond the life of NDC.

WIRELESS RAY TRACING EDUCATIONAL LAND
Technology has a great impact and influence on the educational process in classroom environments. Students can use the advanced computing and telecommunication technologies, to access different types of information and to communicate with their teachers and colleagues using several types of media. Among the new emerging technologies are online three dimensional virtual worlds (3D VWs). This technology can aid students in understanding and predicting physical behaviour, which would otherwise require interactive simulations and laboratories that may be expensive, time consuming and dangerous. Traditional simulations can help carry out virtual experiments but they are often not very interactive, and are frequently complex and slow. 3D VWs provide a natural interactive exploration environment, where individuals and groups can interact and learn. The prototype Wireless Ray-Tracing Educational Land (WRTEL) was built using the OpenSimulator VWs technology, to improve the learning experience for electrical engineering and physics students studying electromagnetic wireless systems. Instead of using textbooks, pictures, equations and paper examples to understand how wireless signals propagate, signals are visualized in an interactive 3D virtual environment. This paper presents the prototype WRTEL, where invisible wireless signal propagation is made visible using the VW technology. Students are able to visualize signal behaviour (reflection, refraction, diffraction and scattering) in either two dimensions (2D) or three dimensions (3D), and information about each interaction between signals and the surrounding environment can be displayed. The WRTEL consists of three main regions. In the first region, three educational tools have been implemented to explore the relationship between wavelength and frequency, the electromagnetic spectrum and antennas. In the second region, a free space laboratory had been designed in simulated outer space to allow students to visualize line of sight signal propagation between the transmitter and the receiver antennas. In the third region, students are provided with a selectable two or three dimensional ray-tracing laboratory, to create environments using obstacles made from different materials. Students will be able to visualize how signal behaviour (reflection, refraction, diffraction and scattering) is affected by the surrounding environment. Path loss calculations, received power, angle of incidence and many other values will be provided at any point in space until the signal is received by the receiver antenna. The transmitted wireless signals will be visualized by mapping them into the visual spectrum for display; this makes the invisible rays visible. A brief technical and educational evaluation indicated that the prototype educational land was both usable and would support student learning activities in laboratories.

Adaptation of cancer cells from different entities to the MDM2 inhibitor nutlin-3 results in the emergence of p53-mutated multi-drug-resistant cancer cells
Six p53 wild-type cancer cell lines from infrequently p53-mutated entities (neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and melanoma) were continuously exposed to increasing concentrations of the murine double minute 2 inhibitor nutlin-3, resulting in the emergence of nutlin-3-resistant, p53-mutated sublines displaying a multi-drug resistance phenotype. Only 2 out of 28 sublines adapted to various cytotoxic drugs harboured p53 mutations. Nutlin-3-adapted UKF-NB-3 cells (UKF-NB-3rNutlin 10 ??M, harbouring a G245C mutation) were also radiation resistant. Analysis of UKF-NB-3 and UKF-NB-3rNutlin 10 ??M cells by RNA interference experiments and lentiviral transduction of wild-type p53 into p53-mutated UKF-NB-3rNutlin 10 ??M cells revealed that the loss of p53 function contributes to the multi-drug resistance of UKF-NB-3rNutlin 10 ??M cells. Bioinformatics PANTHER pathway analysis based on microarray measurements of mRNA abundance indicated a substantial overlap in the signalling pathways differentially regulated between UKF-NB-3rNutlin 10 ??M and UKF-NB-3 and between UKF-NB-3 and its cisplatin-, doxorubicin-, or vincristineresistant sublines. Repeated nutlin-3 adaptation of neuroblastoma cells resulted in sublines harbouring various p53 mutations with high frequency. A p53 wild-type single cell-derived UKF-NB-3 clone was adapted to nutlin-3 in independent experiments. Eight out of ten resulting sublines were p53-mutated harbouring six different p53 mutations. This indicates that nutlin-3 induces de novo p53 mutations not initially present in the original cell population. Therefore, nutlin-3-treated cancer patients should be carefully monitored for the emergence of p53-mutated, multi-drug-resistant cells. ?? 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

[protein, cell, synaps, size, segregation, datum, model, parameter, mechanism, process]

Boltzmann energy-based image analysis demonstrates that extracellular domain size differences explain protein segregation at immune synapses.
Immune synapses formed by T and NK cells both show segregation of the integrin ICAM1 from other proteins such as CD2 (T cell) or KIR (NK cell). However, the mechanism by which these proteins segregate remains unclear; one key hypothesis is a redistribution based on protein size. Simulations of this mechanism qualitatively reproduce observed segregation patterns, but only in certain parameter regimes. Verifying that these parameter constraints in fact hold has not been possible to date, this requiring a quantitative coupling of theory to experimental data. Here, we address this challenge, developing a new methodology for analysing and quantifying image data and its integration with biophysical models. Specifically we fit a binding kinetics model to 2 colour fluorescence data for cytoskeleton independent synapses (2 and 3D) and test whether the observed inverse correlation between fluorophores conforms to size dependent exclusion, and further, whether patterned states are predicted when model parameters are estimated on individual synapses. All synapses analysed satisfy these conditions demonstrating that the mechanisms of protein redistribution have identifiable signatures in their spatial patterns. We conclude that energy processes implicit in protein size based segregation can drive the patternation observed in individual synapses, at least for the specific examples tested, such that no additional processes need to be invoked. This implies that biophysical processes within the membrane interface have a crucial impact on cell:cell communication and cell signalling, governing protein interactions and protein aggregation.

Aerosol observations and growth rates downwind of the anvil of a deep tropical thunderstorm
We present a case study of Aitken and accumulation mode aerosol observed downwind of the anvil of a deep tropical thunderstorm. The measurements were made by condensation nuclei counters flown on the Egrett high-altitude aircraft from Darwin during the ACTIVE campaign, in monsoon conditions producing widespread convection over land and ocean. Maximum measured concentrations of aerosol with diameter greater than 10 nm were 25 000 cm(-3) (STP). By calculating back-trajectories from the observations, and projecting onto infrared satellite images, the time since the air exited cloud was estimated. In this way a time scale of about 3 hours was derived for the Aitken aerosol concentration to reach its peak. We examine the hypothesis that the growth in aerosol concentrations can be explained by production of sulphuric acid from SO2 followed by particle nucleation and coagulation. Estimates of the sulphuric acid production rate show that the observations are only consistent with this hypothesis if the particles coagulate to sizes > 10 nm much more quickly than is suggested by current theory. Alternatively, other condensible gases (possibly organic) drive the growth of aerosol particles in the TTL.

Cochlear implantation in a child with CINCA syndrome who also has wide vestibular aqueducts.
Chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular (CINCA) syndrome is a severe auto-inflammatory disease, due to mutation of the CIAS1 gene. CINCA syndrome should be considered the most severe of a spectrum of three disorders all due to mutation of the CIAS1 gene. CINCA syndrome produces a triad of symptoms of neonatal onset: maculopapular urticarial rash, chronic meningitis, and chronic non-inflammatory arthropathy with recurrent fever. CINCA syndrome is also associated with sensory organ damage, especially progressive hearing loss and loss of vision. In this case report, we present the first case of cochlear implantation in a 13-year-old child with CINCA syndrome. Cochlear implantation was successful at rehabilitating the hearing loss with the child able to continue mainstream education, with her academic performance and speech discrimination both showing marked improvement. Anakinra (an interleukin 1 receptor antagonist) is now in widespread use to treat CINCA syndrome and is known to rapidly reverse the inflammatory features of CINCA syndrome. However, current evidence suggests that anakinra has limited effectiveness in reversing the sensorineural hearing loss seen in CINCA syndrome. We therefore propose that cochlear implantation is a viable treatment option in this rare yet severe auto-inflammatory disease, if the patient has failed to respond to anakinra. Owing to the unknown pathogenesis of the progressive hearing loss seen in CINCA syndrome and the limited effectiveness of anakinra in reversing the progressive hearing loss, we suggest that cochlear implantation is the modality of choice in rehabilitating severe-to-profound hearing loss not responsive to anakinra.

High-Spin Isomeric Structures in Exotic Odd-Odd Nuclei: Exploration of the Proton Drip Line and Beyond
<p>We investigate the role of two-quasiparticle isomeric states along the proton drip line, using configuration-constrained potential-energy-surface calculations. In contrast to even-even nuclei, odd-odd nuclei can have coexisting low-lying two-quasiparticle states. The low excitation energy and high angular momentum can lead to long-lived isomers. Also, because of the hindrance by spin selection, the probabilities of beta and proton decays from high-spin isomers can be reduced significantly. The present calculations reproduce reasonably well the available data for observed isomers in such nuclei. Unobserved high-spin isomers are predicted, which could be useful for future experimental studies of exotic nuclei at and beyond the proton drip line.</p>

Circulating tumor cells as a window on metastasis biology in lung cancer.
Circulating tumor cell (CTC) number in metastatic cancer patients yields prognostic information consistent with enhanced cell migration and invasion via loss of adhesion, a feature of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Tumor cells also invade via collective migration with maintained cell-cell contacts and consistent with this is the circulating tumor microemboli (CTM; contiguous groups of tumor cells) that are observed in metastatic cancer patients. Using a blood filtration approach, we examined markers of EMT (cytokeratins, E-cadherin, vimentin, neural cadherin) and prevalence of apoptosis in CTCs and CTM to explore likely mechanism(s) of invasion in lung cancer patients and address the hypothesis that cells within CTM have a survival advantage. Intra-patient and inter-patient heterogeneity was observed for EMT markers in CTCs and CTM. Vimentin was only expressed in some CTCs, but in the majority of cells within CTM; E-cadherin expression was lost, cytoplasmic or nuclear, and rarely expressed at the surface of the cells within CTM. A subpopulation of CTCs was apoptotic, but apoptosis was absent within CTM. This pilot study suggests that EMT is not prosecuted homogeneously in tumor cells within the circulation of lung cancer patients and that collective migration and enhanced survival of cells within CTM might contribute to lung cancer metastasis. Multiplex analysis and further detailed exploration of metastatic potential and EMT in CTCs/CTM is now warranted in a larger patient cohort.

Inflammatory biomarkers improve clinical prediction of mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
RATIONALE: Accurate prediction of mortality helps select patients for interventions aimed at improving outcome. OBJECTIVES: Because chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized by low-grade systemic inflammation, we hypothesized that addition of inflammatory biomarkers to established predictive factors will improve accuracy. METHODS: A total of 1,843 patients enrolled in the Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints study were followed for 3 years. Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank analysis, and Cox proportional hazards analyses determined the predictive value for mortality of clinical variables, while C statistics assessed the added discriminative power offered by addition of biomarkers. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At recruitment we measured anthropometrics, spirometry, 6-minute walk distance, dyspnea, BODE index, history of hospitalization, comorbidities, and computed tomography scan emphysema. White blood cell and neutrophil counts, serum or plasma levels of fibrinogen, chemokine ligand 18, surfactant protein D, C-reactive protein, Clara cell secretory protein-16, IL-6 and -8, and tumor necrosis factor-α were determined at recruitment and subsequent visits. A total of 168 of the 1,843 patients (9.1%) died. Nonsurvivors were older and had more severe airflow limitation, increased dyspnea, higher BODE score, more emphysema, and higher rates of comorbidities and history of hospitalizations. The best predictive model for mortality using clinical variables included age, BODE, and hospitalization history (C statistic of 0.686; P < 0.001). One single biomarker (IL-6) significantly improved the C statistic to 0.708, but this was further improved to 0.726 (P = 0.003) by the addition of all biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of a panel of selected biomarkers improves the ability of established clinical variables to predict mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00292552).

Development of a patient reported outcome measure for fatigue in motor neurone disease: the Neurological Fatigue Index (NFI-MND)

Fatigue was defined as reversible motor weakness and whole-body tiredness that was predominantly brought on by muscular exertion and was partially relieved by rest.MethodsQualitative interviews were undertaken to confirm the suitability of a previously identified set of 52 neurological fatigue items as relevant to patients with MND. Patients were recruited from five U.K. MND clinics. Questionnaires were administered during clinic or by post. A sub-sample of patients completed the questionnaire again after 2-4 weeks to assess test-retest validity. Exploratory factor analyses and Rasch analysis were conducted on the item set.ResultsQualitative interviews with ten MND patients confirmed the suitability of 52 previously identified neurological fatigue items as relevant to patients with MND. 298 patients consented to completing the initial questionnaire including this item set, with an additional 78 patients completing the questionnaire a second time after 4-6 weeks. Exploratory Factor Analysis identified five potential subscales that could be conceptualised as representing: 'Energy', 'Reversible muscular weakness' (shortened to 'Weakness'), 'Concentration', 'Effects of heat' and 'Rest'. Of the original five factors, two factors 'Energy' and 'Weakness' met the expectations of the Rasch model. A higher order fatigue summary scale, consisting of items from the 'Energy' and 'Weakness' subscales, was found to fit the Rasch model and have acceptable unidimensionality. The two scales and the higher order summary scale were shown to fulfil model expectations, including assumptions of unidimensionality, local independency and an absence of differential item functioning.ConclusionsThe Neurological Fatigue Index for MND (NFI-MND) is a simple, easy-to-administer fatigue scale. It consists of an 8-item fatigue summary scale in addition to separate scales for measuring fatigue experienced as reversible muscular weakness and fatigue expressed as feelings of low energy and whole body tiredness. The underlying two factor structure supports the patient concept of fatigue derived from qualitative interviews in this population. All three scales were shown to be reliable and capable of interval level measurement.

Plant Vascular Cell Division Is Maintained by an Interaction between PXY and Ethylene Signalling
Abstract: The procambium and cambium are meristematic tissues from which vascular tissue is derived. Vascular initials differentiate into phloem towards the outside of the stem and xylem towards the inside. A small peptide derived from CLV-3/ESR1-LIKE 41 (CLE41) is thought to promote cell divisions in vascular meristems by signalling through the PHLOEM INTERCALLATED WITH XYLEM (PXY) receptor kinase. pxy mutants, however, display only small reductions in vascular cell number, suggesting a mechanism exists that allows plants to compensate for the absence of PXY. Consistent with this idea, we identify a large number of genes specifically upregulated in pxy mutants, including several AP2/ERF transcription factors. These transcription factors are required for normal cell division in the cambium and procambium. These same transcription factors are also upregulated by ethylene and in ethylene-overproducing eto1 mutants. eto1 mutants also exhibit an increase in vascular cell division that is dependent upon the function of at least 2 of these ERF genes. Furthermore, blocking ethylene signalling using a variety of ethylene insensitive mutants such as ein2 enhances the cell division defect of pxy. Our results suggest that these factors define a novel pathway that acts in parallel to PXY/CLE41 to regulate cell division in developing vascular tissue. We propose a model whereby vascular cell division is regulated both by PXY signalling and ethylene/ERF signalling. Under normal circumstances, however, PXY signalling acts to repress the ethylene/ERF pathway.

Elucidation of the Formation of Cubic Mesoporous Silicas
Four cubic mesoporous silicas, SBA-1, SBA-16, AMS-8 and AMS-10, were synthesized and the iso-electron density maps were built based on the amplitudes of structure factors recorded from SAXS and the phases retrieved from reference to HREM. A mesopore fraction to the total volume of the unit cell measured from the nitrogen adsorption was applied to identify the contour of the silica interface.Further, minimal surfaces which correspond to the space groups of the mesostructures were refined in Surface Evolver. The global mean curvatures of the surfaces were adjusted slightly to fulfill the consistent void fractions given by the gas sorption. A comparison has thereby been made between the experimental iso-electron density contours and their corresponding simulated constant-mean-curvature surfaces. A resistance of the silica interface on reducing to the constant-mean-curvature surface was found at the connections between mesocages according to the comparison. It can be concluded that the inorganic moiety undergoes a stronger affinity with the connections where water is filled than the spherical surfactant micelles.Moreover, the surfactant templates of SBA-1 and SBA-16 were removed at temperatures lower than 100 °C in order to maintain the inorganic morphology identical to the as-synthesized samples and avoid any structural shrinkage caused by calcination. The optimum method used was based on the properties of the surfactants: cationic C16TEABr was extracted by the supercritical CO2-MeOH fluid; neutral triblock PEO-PPO-PEO copolymers were broken down by O3.

[cancer, gene, type, region, scna, alteration]

The landscape of somatic copy-number alteration across human cancers.
A powerful way to discover key genes with causal roles in oncogenesis is to identify genomic regions that undergo frequent alteration in human cancers. Here we present high-resolution analyses of somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) from 3,131 cancer specimens, belonging largely to 26 histological types. We identify 158 regions of focal SCNA that are altered at significant frequency across several cancer types, of which 122 cannot be explained by the presence of a known cancer target gene located within these regions. Several gene families are enriched among these regions of focal SCNA, including the BCL2 family of apoptosis regulators and the NF-kappaBeta pathway. We show that cancer cells containing amplifications surrounding the MCL1 and BCL2L1 anti-apoptotic genes depend on the expression of these genes for survival. Finally, we demonstrate that a large majority of SCNAs identified in individual cancer types are present in several cancer types.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of open colposuspension versus laparoscopic colposuspension in the treatment of urodynamic stress incontinence.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the cost effectiveness of laparoscopic versus open colposuspension for the treatment of female urinary stress incontinence. DESIGN: Cost utility analysis alongside a randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Six gynaecological surgical centres within the UK. POPULATION/SAMPLE: Women with proven stress urinary incontinence requiring surgery. METHODS: Open abdominal retropubic colposuspension or laparoscopic colposuspension carried out by experienced surgeons. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost, measured in pounds sterling and generic health-related quality of life, measured using the EQ-5D. The latter was used to estimate patient-specific quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: Healthcare resource use over 6-month follow up translated into costs of pound 1805 for the laparoscopic arm and pound 1433 for the open arm (differential mean cost pound 372; 95% credibility interval CrI: 274-471). At 6 months, QALYs were slightly higher in the laparoscopic arm relative to the open arm (0.005; 95% CrI: -0.012 to 0.023). Therefore, the cost of each extra QALY in the laparoscopic group (the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ICER) was pound 74,400 at 6 months. At 24 months, the laparoscopic arm again had a higher mean QALY score compared to the open surgery group. Thus, assuming that beyond 6 months the laparoscopic colposuspension would not lead to any significant additional costs compared with open colposuspension, the ICER was reduced to pound 9300 at 24 months. Extensive sensitivity analyses were carried out to test assumptions made in the base case scenario. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic colposuspension is not cost effective when compared with open colposuspension during the first 6 months following surgery, but it may be cost effective over 24 months.

On-chip nanoplasmonic biosensors with actively controlled nanofluidic surface delivery
Performances of surface biosensors are often controlled by the analyte delivery rate to the sensing surface instead of sensors intrinsic detection capabilities. In a microfluidic channel, analyte transports diffusively to the biosensor surface severely limiting its performance. At low concentrations, this limitation, commonly known as mass transport problem, causes impractically long detection times extending from days to months. In this proceeding, we propose and demonstrate a hybrid biosensing platform merging nanoplasmonics and nanofluidics. Unlike conventional approaches where the analytes simply stream pass over the sensing surface, our platform enables targeted delivery of analytes to the sensing surface. Our detection platform is based on extraordinary light transmission effect (EOT) in suspended plasmonic nanohole arrays. The subwavelength size nanoholes here act as nanofluidic channels connecting the microfluidic chambers on both sides of the sensors. In order to materialize our detection platform, we also introduce a novel multilayered micro/nanofluidics scheme allowing three dimensional control of the fluidic flow. Using our platform, we show 14-fold improvement in mass transport rate constant appearing in the exponential term. To fabricate these biosensors, we also introduce a lift-off free plasmonic device fabrication technique based on positive resist electron beam lithography. Simplicity of this fabrication technique allows us to fabricate nanostructures with ease, high yield/reproducibility and minimal surface roughness. As a result, we achieve higher refractive index sensitivities. This fabrication technique can find wide range of applications in nanoplasmonics field by eliminating the need for operationally slow and expensive focused ion beam lithography.

Three topologies to globally distribute a clock signal in 3-D circuits have been evaluated. A 3-D test circuit, based on the MITLL 3-D IC manufacturing process, has been designed, fabricated, and measured and is shown to operate at 1.4 GHz. Clock skew measurements indicate that a topology that combines the symmetry of an H-tree on the second plane and local meshes on the other two planes will result in low clock skew for 3-D circuits while consuming the lowest power as compared to the other investigated topologies.

A clinical characterization of familial keloid disease in unique African tribes reveals distinct keloid phenotypes.
BACKGROUND: This study is a clinical characterization of keloid scars in an African population comprising three rural tribes with familial keloids. Site distribution, morphologic features, and other characteristics of the scars were studied to assess whether each tribe had a specific scar phenotype. METHODS: Keloid scar clinics were set up at Soba Hospital in Khartoum, Sudan, for patient recruitment and management. In addition, familial keloid cases were recruited from rural tribal populations during field trips. A database including clinical and demographic data and digital photographs of all keloid cases was established. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS and SAS software. RESULTS: One hundred eleven individuals with keloid scarring (67 male subjects and 44 female subjects) were recruited. Patients were predominantly from three multigenerational pedigrees (total of 38 nuclear families) afflicted with keloid scars residing in different rural regions of Sudan. Two distinct morphologic phenotypes of keloid scarring were observed. The first phenotype has been designated "superficial spreading" (horizontal) keloid and the second has been designated "raised" (vertical) keloid. Clinically significant features and statistically measurable morphologic parameters were compared among these phenotypes (p = 0.001). Furthermore, linear claw-like extensions of keloid (transgression) were noted to be significantly higher in the superficial spreading keloid phenotype (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence of different phenotypes of keloid scarring. Two distinct phenotypes have been observed, described, and statistically verified. Each tribe demonstrated one particular phenotype, with two being superficial spreading and one being raised. Other significant clinical characteristics have been described. This is of significance in understanding both the clinical basis and the genetic basis of keloid scarring.

Cognitive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders: characteristics, causes and the quest for improved therapy.
Studies of psychiatric disorders have traditionally focused on emotional symptoms such as depression, anxiety and hallucinations. However, poorly controlled cognitive deficits are equally prominent and severely compromise quality of life, including social and professional integration. Consequently, intensive efforts are being made to characterize the cellular and cerebral circuits underpinning cognitive function, define the nature and causes of cognitive impairment in psychiatric disorders and identify more effective treatments. Successful development will depend on rigorous validation in animal models as well as in patients, including measures of real-world cognitive functioning. This article critically discusses these issues, highlighting the challenges and opportunities for improving cognition in individuals suffering from psychiatric disorders.

Immune homeostasis in the respiratory tract and its impact on heterologous infection.
Innate immunity at mucosal surfaces requires additional restraint to prevent inflammation to innocuous antigens or commensal microorganisms. The threshold above which airway macrophages become activated is raised by site-specific factors including the receptors for transforming growth factor beta, interleukin 10 and CD200; the ligands for which are produced by, or expressed on, respiratory epithelium. We discuss such site-specific regulation and how this is continually altered by prior infections. Resetting of innate reactivity represents a strategy for limiting excessive inflammation, but in some may pre-dispose to secondary bacterial pneumonia.

Premature death after self-harm: a multicentre cohort study.
BACKGROUND: People who self-harm have an increased risk of premature death. The aim of this study was to investigate cause-specific premature death in individuals who self-harm, including associations with socioeconomic deprivation. METHODS: We undertook a cohort study of patients of all ages presenting to emergency departments in Oxford, Manchester, and Derby, UK, after self-poisoning or self-injury between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2007. Postcodes of individuals' place of residence were linked to the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2007 in England. Mortality information was supplied by the Medical Research Information Service of the National Health Service. Patients were followed up to the end of 2009. We calculated age-standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and years of life lost (YLL), and we tested for associations with socioeconomic deprivation. FINDINGS: 30 950 individuals presented with self-harm and were followed up for a median of 6·0 years (IQR 3·9-7·9). 1832 (6·1%) patients died before the end of follow-up. Death was more likely in patients than in the general population (SMR 3·6, 95% CI 3·5-3·8), and occurred more in males (4·1, 3·8-4·3) than females (3·2, 2·9-3·4). Deaths due to natural causes were 2-7·5 times more frequent than was expected. For individuals who died of any cause, mean YLL was 31·4 years (95% CI 30·5-32·2) for male patients and 30·7 years (29·5-31·9) for female patients. Mean YLL for natural-cause deaths was 25·9 years (25·7-26·0) for male patients and 25·5 years (25·2-25·8) for female patients, and for external-cause deaths was 40·2 years (40·0-40·3) and 40·0 years (39·7-40·5), respectively. Disease of the circulatory (13·1% in males; 13·0% in females) and digestive (11·7% in males; 17·8% in females) systems were major contributors to YLL from natural causes. All-cause mortality increased with each quartile of socioeconomic deprivation in male patients (χ(2) trend 39·6; p<0·0001), female patients (13·9; p=0·0002), and both sexes combined (55·4; p<0·0001). Socioeconomic deprivation was related to mortality in both sexes combined from natural causes (51·0; p<0·0001) but not from external causes (0·30; p=0·58). Alcohol problems were associated with death from digestive-system disease, drug misuse with mental and behavioural disorders, and physical health problems with circulatory-system disease. INTERPRETATION: Physical health and life expectancy are severely compromised in individuals who self-harm compared with the general population. In the management of self-harm, clinicians assessing patients' psychosocial problems should also consider their physical needs. FUNDING: Department of Health Policy Research Programme.

Temperature-dependent properties of resin-composites before and during the setting process
Dental Resin-Composites contain inorganic particles, coated with organic coupling agent, dispersed in an organic resin-matrix. In their precured state they are viscous pastes that change rapidly to a hardened mass after photo-activation. Temperature change is expected to modify several physical properties.The aims were to determine the extent to which increasing temperature from ambient (23 oC) to body temperature (37 oC) may affect properties before and during the setting process. Six representative resin-composites were selected GRO, GCK, VDD, FXE, GDP, and GDA.Temperature-dependence of handling properties (packing stress and viscosity) of pre-cured resin composites was examined using a penetrometer instrument at 23 oC, 30 oC, and 37 oC. Viscosity was reduced significantly by up to 93 % at 37 oC compared to 23 oC. Temperature-dependence of degree-of-conversion (DC) was measured by FTIR spectroscopy at 23 oC and 37 oC. DC was also time-dependent after photo-activation at both temperatures, with all examined materials having higher DC at 1 h than 0 h.A modified bonded-disk instrument was used for simultaneous measurement of: shrinkage-strain, exotherm, and Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) at 23 oC. Shrinkage-strain, exotherm, and CTE were all found to correlate negatively with filler-load. Positive correlation was found also between shrinkage-strain and CTE.Temperature-dependence of shrinkage-strain kinetics, at 23 oC and 37 oC, was examined with the bonded-disk instrument. Mean 1h shrinkage-strains at 37 oC were numerically and significantly greater (p<0.05) than those at 23 oC for all cases except GDA and GDP. The activation energy (EA) of the shrinkage-strain kinetic process was calculated for each material, and a positive correlation was found between EA and the percentage of total organic material, calculated from the combustion technique.The Bioman instrument was used, for the first time, to measure temperature-dependence of shrinkage-stress kinetics at 23 oC and 37 oC. At 23 oC, all materials demonstrated a greater stress at 1h than 2 min after photo-activation. At 37 oC, there were no significant stress differences between 2 min and 1h. VDD composite showed a reduced stress 1h after photo-activation at 37 oC than at 23 oC.  This suggests a pronounced visco-elastic character.  Understanding the effects of temperature on dental composites can influence the possible adoption of clinical preheating regimes, prior to light-curing.

Whole genome sequencing of matched primary and metastatic acral melanomas.
Next generation sequencing has enabled systematic discovery of mutational spectra in cancer samples. Here, we used whole genome sequencing to characterize somatic mutations and structural variation in a primary acral melanoma and its lymph node metastasis. Our data show that the somatic mutational rates in this acral melanoma sample pair were more comparable to the rates reported in cancer genomes not associated with mutagenic exposure than in the genome of a melanoma cell line or the transcriptome of melanoma short-term cultures. Despite the perception that acral skin is sun-protected, the dominant mutational signature in these samples is compatible with damage due to ultraviolet light exposure. A nonsense mutation in ERCC5 discovered in both the primary and metastatic tumors could also have contributed to the mutational signature through accumulation of unrepaired dipyrimidine lesions. However, evidence of transcription-coupled repair was suggested by the lower mutational rate in the transcribed regions and expressed genes. The primary and the metastasis are highly similar at the level of global gene copy number alterations, loss of heterozygosity and single nucleotide variation (SNV). Furthermore, the majority of the SNVs in the primary tumor were propagated in the metastasis and one nonsynonymous coding SNV and one splice site mutation appeared to arise de novo in the metastatic lesion.

Functional diversity of bacteria in a ferruginous hydrothermal sediment
A microbial community showing diverse respiratory processes was identified within an arsenic-rich, ferruginous shallow marine hydrothermal sediment (20-40 degrees C, pH 6.0-6.3) in Santorini, Greece. Analyses showed that ferric iron reduction with depth was broadly accompanied by manganese and arsenic reduction and FeS accumulation. Clone library analyses indicated the suboxic-anoxic transition zone sediment contained abundant Fe(III)- and sulfate-reducing Deltaproteobacteria, whereas the overlying surface sediment was dominated by clones related to the Fe(II)-oxidizing zetaproteobacterium, Mariprofundus ferroxydans. Cultures obtained from the transition zone were enriched in bacteria that reduced Fe(III), nitrate, sulfate and As(V) using acetate or lactate as electron donors. In the absence of added organic carbon, bacteria were enriched that oxidized Fe(II) anaerobically or microaerobically, sulfide microaerobically and aerobically and As(III) aerobically. According to 16S rRNA gene analyses, enriched bacteria represented a phylogenetically wide distribution. Most probable number counts indicated an abundance of nitrate-, As(V)- and Fe(III)((s,aq))-reducers, and dissolved sulfide-oxidizers over sulfate-reducers, and FeS-, As(III)and nitrate-dependent Fe(II)-oxidisers in the transition zone. It is noteworthy that the combined community and geochemical data imply near-surface microbial iron and arsenic redox cycling were dominant biogeochemical processes.

Genome-based phylogenetic analysis of Streptomyces and its relatives
Motivation: Streptomyces is one of the best-studied genera of the order Actinomycetales due to its great importance in medical science, ecology and the biotechnology industry. A comprehensive, detailed and robust phylogeny of Streptomyces and its relatives is needed for understanding how this group emerged and maintained such a vast diversity throughout evolution and how soil-living mycelial forms (e.g., Streptomyces s. str.) are related to parasitic, unicellular pathogens (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis) or marine species (e.g., Salinispora tropica). The most important application area of such a phylogenetic analysis will be in the comparative re-annotation of genome sequences and the reconstruction of Streptomyces metabolic networks for biotechnology. Methods: Classical 16S-rRNA-based phylogenetic reconstruction does not guarantee to produce well-resolved robust trees that reflect the overall relationship between bacterial species with widespread horizontal gene transfer. In our study we therefore combine three whole genome-based phylogenies with eight different, highly informative single-gene phylogenies to determine a new robust consensus tree of 45 Actinomycetales species with completely sequenced genomes. Results: None of the individual methods achieved a resolved phylogeny of Streptomyces and its relatives. Single-gene approaches failed to yield a detailed phylogeny; even though the single trees are in good agreement among each other, they show very low resolution of inner branches. The three whole genome-based methods improve resolution considerably. Only by combining the phylogenies from single gene-based and genome-based approaches we finally obtained a consensus tree with well-resolved branches for the entire set of Actinomycetales species. This phylogenetic information is stable and informative enough for application to the system-wide comparative modeling of bacterial physiology. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Experiments and numerical simulations of the dynamics of an R.O.V. thruster during maneuvering
Propeller dynamics have typically been ignored in controller
design, lumped into the category of 'unmodeled dynamics.' This
is acceptable for propellers operating at constant speed in
relatively uniform flows. Operational parameters of small
remotely operated vehicles and autonomous underwater vehicles
require a great deal of transient operation of the propellers.
This and the small mass of the vehicles make the dynamics of the
propellers a significant factor in vehicle control. Expanding
roles of these vehicles require improved control and therefore
improved understanding of the dynamics of the thrusters during
maneuvering.
In this thesis, the dynamics of maneuvering thrusters were
explored through numerical simulation and experiments. Vortex
lattice propeller code developed for use with nonuniform inflow
was adapted to incorporate varying propeller speed and inflow
velocity. Test runs were made using a three bladed propeller.
Experiments were preformed on a thruster from the ROV Jason using
the water tunnel at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The thruster incorporated a ducted three bladed propeller. Runs
were made using step changes in shaft velocity as well as
sinusoidal perturbations on top of steady state velocities. Runs
were also made incorporating fully reversing propeller operation.
Experiments were done with and without the duct in place.
The numerical simulation and experimental results showed that
accelerating propeller angular velocity created higher thrust
values than steady state propeller operation at the corresponding
instantaneous shaft velocity. Decelerating angular velocities
created lower thrust values. This is attributed to a lag in the
local flow velocity due to the momentum of the fluid. For the
case of the accelerating propeller, the angle of attack at the
blade is higher, resulting in higher lift force and greater
thrust. Errors in the numerical code at low advance coefficients
prevented direct comparison of numerical code results to
experimental results.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution September 199

IL-12 treatment attenuates T helper cell type 2 and B cell responses but does not improve vaccine-enhanced lung illness.
In humans and mice, sensitization to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Ags can result in severe inflammatory lung disease during subsequent infection with RSV. Although specific antiviral T cells are thought to be responsible for this augmentation of disease, the precise roles of different functional subsets are unknown, and no protective nonpathogenic subset has been defined. BALB/c mice sensitized to the major surface glycoprotein of RSV (G) expressed by recombinant vaccinia virus develop Th2-driven lung eosinophilia after intranasal challenge with RSV. In an attempt to manipulate the outcome of vaccination, we treated mice with IL-12 at various times during vaccination and challenge. IL-12 treatment reduced the vaccine-induced lung eosinophilia during RSV challenge, but increased the total lymphoid cell infiltration into the alveolar space. Analysis of intracellular cytokines by flow cytometry showed that IFN-gamma production during challenge was increased, and IL-4 and IL-5 levels were reduced by IL-12 treatment. In control treated mice, 40 to 50% of the lung lymphoid cells were B cells. Treatment with IL-12 reduced this figure to approximately 1.5%. Although IL-12 treatment reduced lung eosinophilia, illness (as assessed by weight loss) was not eliminated and, in some experiments, was increased. The present study shows that reversing Th2-associated pathology with IL-12 does not necessarily benefit the host.

Nodular fasciitis of the head and neck.
Nodular fasciitis is an unusual benign reactive process affecting superficial and deep fascia. Its rapid growth, rich cellularity, high mitotic activity and poorly circumscribed nature result in it being easily misdiagnosed as a sarcomatous lesion. Three cases of nodular fasciitis presenting as neck lumps are reported. They were successfully treated with local excision, with no signs of recurrence following two years of follow up. This paper describes the clinical presentation and microscopic features of this rare benign lesion and it emphasizes the need for accurate histopathology and clinical suspicion, if inappropriate aggressive management is to be avoided.

<p>The occurrence of oblate and prolate shapes is investigated theoretically for odd-odd neutron-rich nuclei with A approximate to 190. Using the cranked Woods-Saxon-Strutinsky method, including configuration constraints, it is found that collective oblate rotation coexists with high-K prolate rotation, for tantalum and rhenium isotopes with N=115 and 117.</p>

Managing self-limiting respiratory tract infections: a qualitative study of the usefulness of the delayed prescribing strategy.
BACKGROUND: Despite respiratory tract infections usually being viral and self-limiting, most primary care consultations still result in an antibiotic prescription. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) introduced the 'delayed prescribing' (DP) strategy. It remains unknown how useful UK clinicians find this approach. AIM: To investigate how DP is used within UK primary care, and the benefits and challenges associated with this strategy. DESIGN AND SETTING: Qualitative interview and focus group study in UK scheduled and unscheduled care primary care settings. METHOD: Data were gathered through semi-structured interviews (n = 49) and six focus groups with GPs, trainee GPs, and nurse prescribers (NPs). An iterative analysis approach, using grounded theory principles, was used to generate themes from the dataset. RESULTS: Prescribers were familiar with DP but used it infrequently. DP was often used to manage diagnostic uncertainty, although NPs, trainee GPs, and GPs working in unscheduled care services preferred patients to reconsult under these circumstances. Prescribers used DP to avoid conflict, although some had found more effective strategies to achieve this. Prescribers were generally uncomfortable giving clinical responsibility to patients, and DP was perceived to communicate a conflicting message to patients about antibiotic efficacy. CONCLUSION: DP was not considered to be a helpful strategy for managing patients with self-limiting respiratory tract infections within primary care and the findings do not support the centrality of DP in NICE guidelines as a primary means of reducing antibiotic prescribing. Future training and guidelines should encourage alternative ways of communicating empathy, addressing patient beliefs, and encouraging self-management.

[chemotherapy, patient, treatment, month, platinum-based, time, rr, sclc, survival, median]

Outcomes of small-cell lung cancer patients treated with second-line chemotherapy: a multi-institutional retrospective analysis.
BACKGROUND: Patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) that progress after first-line chemotherapy have a poor prognosis and the evidence of a benefit from second-line (SL) chemotherapy is limited. Patients relapsing or progressing more than 90 days after completion of first-line treatment are considered platinum sensitive and may be rechallenged with platinum-based chemotherapy. Topotecan is approved as SL treatment independent of time to progression. This retrospective analysis evaluates the clinical outcomes of SCLC patients who received SL chemotherapy after platinum-etoposide chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 161 patients who received SL chemotherapy for SCLC. Patients were divided into four subgroups by type of SL treatment: (1) platinum-based rechallenge; (2) anthracycline-based regimens; (3) topotecan; (4) other single agents. The endpoints were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and response rate (RR). Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional hazard model was used for multivariate analysis to investigate factors influencing survival. RESULTS: The median age was 63. There were 125 males and 36 females. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS) was 0, 1 and 2 in 12.5%, 62.5% and 25% of patients, respectively. Platinum sensitive/platinum resistant/platinum refractory/unknown=121/29/3/8 patients. Median time to SL chemotherapy was 6.9 months. The median PFS from starting second-line treatment was 4.3 months and median OS was 5.8 months. The overall RR was 22.9%. There was a trend toward higher RR (34.5% vs 17.5%, p for trend: 0.06) and OS (9.2 months vs 5.8 months, p=0.08) for patients with sensitive disease who were rechallenged with platinum-based chemotherapy. A multivariate analysis that adjusted for the time to SL treatment showed that a platinum-containing regimen achieves better RR, PFS and OS independently of the time to SL chemotherapy and that response to first-line treatment and PS at SL are the only independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome for second-line therapy for SCLC was poor and benefit appeared to be limited to those patients with good PS and rechallenged with platinum-based chemotherapy. Platinum-based rechallenge should be considered as a standard comparator in future randomized controlled trials of SL chemotherapy.

Treatment of pulmonary aspergilloma with itraconazole.
In a 12 month open study of itraconazole in pulmonary aspergilloma nine patients received oral itraconazole 200 mg daily for six months followed by further itraconazole or observation for a further six months. There was no change in the serum IgG specific for Aspergillus fumigatus (mean (SE) change -4% (10%)) or symptoms of chronic cough and haemoptysis. In two of the three patients who continued treatment beyond six months symptoms and radiographic appearances improved and a temporary reduction in A fumigatus specific IgG occurred in one patient. Further experience of the effects of longer treatment are needed before oral itraconazole can be recommended for aspergilloma.

An in vitro model of dermatophyte invasion of the human hair follicle.
A novel in vitro model for the study of hair invasion by Trichophyton mentagrophytes was developed. Hair was obtained by microdissection and plucking. Following inoculation of the hair follicle with arthroconidia growth of the fungus was seen on the hair and within the follicle. Growth was observed to begin at the shaft end and to extend along the hair shaft towards the bulb area. In follicles maintained in organ culture the inner root sheath in particular was invaded by T. mentagrophytes and provided a good substrate for fungal growth. Initially, the cuticle formed a barrier to fungal penetration of the hair. After incubation for 4 days, germlings of T. mentagrophytes were seen to penetrate under the cuticle and in between the layers of cuticular cells to invade the cortex. There was no evidence of intracellular growth; fungal elements were seen intercellularly. There were similarities between the findings in this study of the process of hair invasion by dermatophyte fungi and that in the natural disease.

Thermal ghost imaging with averaged speckle patterns
We present theoretical and experimental results showing that a thermal ghost imaging system can produce images of high quality even when it uses detectors so slow that they respond only to intensity-averaged (that is, “blurred”) speckle patterns, as long as the collected signal variation is predominantly caused by the random fluctuation of the incident speckle field rather than other noise sources. In our experimental study, we show that the quality of the ghost image is not degraded when as many as 25 speckle patterns are averaged together for each measurement. This surprising result comes from the fact that the averaging of speckle patterns leads to a decrease in the contrast but not in the kurtosis, and the image quality of a ghost imaging system is dependent on the kurtosis rather than the contrast ratio of the illuminating field. These results suggest that a broad class of imaging systems based on the use of speckle techniques can be implemented even using detectors that respond slowly on the time scale of the fluctuating speckle pattern.

A qualitative and quantitative study of the distribution of pelagic sediment in the Atlantic Basin
Pelagic sedimentation is the primary modifier of topography generated by ridge-associated
volcanic and tectonic processes. This thesis represents an effort to understand the
processes of, and the general distribution of, pelagic sedimentation on rough topography,
particularly in the Atlantic Basin but with applications to the world ocean as a whole.
This study utilizes a simple numerical model of sedimentation which, when applied to
models of rough basement topography, allows us to study sedimentation effects in terms of
commonly-measured stochastic parameters including seafloor RMS height, abyssal hill
spacing, and slope distribution. We also address the effect of sediment compaction on
seafloor morphology, and the impact of long-wavelength topography on stochastic
measures of sedimented seafloor.
Understanding gained allows the construction of inverse problems to obtain information
about sediment distribution and basement morphology from multibeam bathymetric data in
regimes where backscatter from rough, reflective basement highs obscures returns from
wide-beam seismic systems. By using maximum likelihood estimation to compare slope
distribution functions calculated from data to those from filtered model topographies, we
estimate average sediment thickness L, basement RMS height H, and a measure of
sediment mobility K.
Using data from near-ridge surveys and off-axis transit lines, we invert for L, H, and K for
3-29 Ma seafloor from the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) near 26°N, 2-
45 Ma seafloor from the western flank of the MAR near 26°S, 2-40 Ma seafloor from the
eastern flank of the MAR near 25°S, and 1-38 Ma seafloor from the western flank of the
MAR near 35°S. Variations in L with seafloor age allow us to constrain sediment rain rate
and the corrosivity of bottom waters to calcite since the Oligocene. We hypothesize that
sediment rain rates during much of the early and middle Miocene were only 10-50% of the
average rate for the past -10 m.y. Variations in H suggest correlation between tectonic
setting and topographic variability. A relatively narrow range of K is needed to describe
intrahill sedimentation patterns.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution February 1997Financial support for this thesis was provided by ONR grants NOOO 14-90-J-1584,

[therapy, larval, patient, treatment, preference, participant]

Exploring patient perceptions of larval therapy as a potential treatment for venous leg ulceration.
OBJECTIVES: To explore patient preferences and acceptability of two forms of larval therapy ('bagged' and 'loose'). BACKGROUND: Larval therapy is frequently used to treat patients with leg ulcers. However, patient preferences and acceptability of larval therapy when compared with other treatments is not established. DESIGN: A survey of patient preferences between larvae and standard therapy (hydrogel) using randomized allocation of two questionnaires ('bagged' or 'loose' questionnaire). The questionnaire contained closed and open-response questions and was administered by a nurse researcher. Open responses enabled exploration of patients' preferences and the acceptability of larval therapy when compared with a standard treatment. Qualitative data were analysed for thematic content. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-five participants, aged 18 years and above, with at least one venous leg ulcer were recruited from a UK Hospital Vascular Outpatients Clinic. FINDINGS: Majority of participants stated that they would consider larval therapy, irrespective of method of containment. Acceptance of therapy was influenced by length of time with (or recurrence of) ulceration, experiences of other treatments, social contact in hospitals and the experiences of others. Visual imagery was a key influence among participants who would refuse larval therapy. Refusal was mostly among older women (aged 70 years or above). CONCLUSIONS: Eliciting patient preferences and increasing patient involvement in treatment decisions is an important part of quality improvement and improved health outcomes. These findings have relevance for practitioners offering larval therapy as a treatment option and for the feasibility of clinical trials.

Practicalities of running non-commercial clinical drug trials in the NHS: A resource based on the experiences of the CUtLASS study (Cost utility of the latest antipsychotics in severe schizophrenia).
Background: Despite randomized controlled trials (RCTs) being regarded as the gold standard for intervention research in mental health, there is a lack of guidance on the practicalities of setting up and conducting such trials in the NHS.Aims: To provide information for new clinical trials collated from the experiences of carrying out the NCCHTA-funded CUtLASS trial (reported in an HTA Monograph entitled ‘‘Randomised controlled trials of conventional versus new atypical drugs, and new atypical drugs versus clozapine, in people with schizophrenia responding poorly to, or intolerant of, current drug treatment’’).Conclusions: The main practical considerations in clinical trials can be grouped into issues of Staffing, Trial Management and Data Management. Matters that impact on recruitment include the research question, the interest of clinicians in that question, the extent of clinical equipoise, and the provision of adequate reimbursement of service support costs associated with participation in the trial.

A Systematic Review to Quantitatively Evaluate 'Stepping Stones': A Participatory Community-based HIV/AIDS Prevention Intervention.
This first independent systematic review examined evidence for the effectiveness of the stepping stones intervention in HIV prevention. To reduce HIV transmission it addresses gender roles and promotes equitable relationships. Biomedical, behavioural and psychosocial outcomes extracted from six databases and 'grey' literature identified eight reports of seven studies (n = 14,630) from India, Gambia, S. Africa, Ethiopia, Angola, Tanzania, Uganda and Fiji. Infection incidence tested in the only RCT showed no significant reduction in HIV, although HSV-2 decreased. Condom use increased (two countries out of eight). Risk reduction results were mixed for declining alcohol misuse (two studies in three) and multiple partners (one in two). Communicating HIV information to partners, family or community improved (three studies from seven). Gender inequity was reduced in India (one in five), but stigma decreased in four studies. Future investigations of diverse cultures and older adults should select high quality biomedical and quality of life measures.

Ab initio investigation of molecular hydrogen physisorption on graphene and carbon nanotubes
<p>Density-functional theory is used to investigate hydrogen physisorption on a graphene layer and on single wall carbon nanotubes. Both external and internal adsorption sites of (9, 0) and (10, 0) carbon nanotubes have been studied with the hydrogen molecular axis oriented parallel or perpendicular to the nanotube wall. A range of hydrogen molecule binding sites has been examined and it is found that hydrogen binds weakly to each of the graphitic structures and at all adsorption sites examined. Calculations using different functionals reveal that the binding energies are a factor of 2 larger for hydrogen bound inside the nanotubes than for adsorption outside the nanotubes or on the graphene layer. Furthermore, configurations of the hydrogen molecular axis parallel to the nanotube wall or graphene layer bind more effectively than configurations where the axis is normal to the carbon nanostructures. The differing behavior between the carbon nanostructures is attributed to the curvature of the structure and the hydrogen-carbon electron interactions, where analysis of the electron density reveals evidence of charge redistribution with little charge transfer. The potential of hydrogen physisorption to carbon nanostructures for hydrogen storage and delivery is also discussed.</p>

GM-CSF-modulated phagocytosis of Trichosporon beigelii by human neutrophils.
Trichosporon beigelii has emerged as a lethal opportunist pathogen in granulocytopenic and corticosteroid-treated patients. Little is known of the host defence mechanisms against this yeast. The interaction between human neutrophils and serum-opsonised T. beigelii and the effect of GM-CSF on binding and ingestion of the yeast by neutrophils were investigated by a microscopic analysis of neutrophil monolayers stained with FITC-Concanavalin A. Positive staining with FITC-Concanavalin A distinguished between intracellular and extracellular yeast cells. Binding of T. beigelii to neutrophils was an energy- and complement-dependent process involving movement of actin in the neutrophil cytoskeleton. The mean percentage binding of T. beigelii was 37.5% and the mean binding index (BI) was 1.30 whereas the mean percentage ingestion was 3.5% and the mean phagocytic index (PI) was 1.34. GM-CSF increased percentage ingestion of T. beigelli from 2.8% to 30.5% and the PI was increased from 1.3 to 1.86. The percentage binding was 36.8% and the mean BI was 1.3 in control experiments compared with 49.3% and 1.6, respectively, in the presence of GM-CSF. In conclusion, GM-CSF significantly increased percentage ingestion of opsonised T. beigelii by neutrophils, but its effect on percentage binding of the yeast was not statistically significant.

Early gene regulation of osteogenesis in embryonic stem cells
The early gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that mediate stem cell differentiation are complex, and the underlying regulatory associations can be difficult to map accurately. In this study, the expression profiles of the genes Dlx5,Msx2 and Runx2 in mouse embryonic stem cells were monitored over a 48 hour period after exposure to the growth factors BMP2 and TGFb 1. Candidate GRNs of early osteogenesis were constructed based on published experimental findings and simulation results of Boolean and ordinary differential equation models were compared with our experimental data in order to test the validity of these models. Three gene regulatory networks were found to be consistent with the data, one of these networks exhibited sustained oscillation, a behaviour which is consistent with the general view of embryonic stem cell plasticity. The work cycle presented in this paper illustrates how mathematical modelling can be used to elucidate from gene expression profiles GRNs that are consistent with experimental data.

The status of the QUIJOTE multi-frequency instrument
The QUIJOTE-CMB project has been described in previous publications. Here we present the current status of the QUIJOTE multi-frequency instrument (MFI) with five separate polarimeters (providing 5 independent sky pixels): two which operate at 10-14 GHz, two which operate at 16-20 GHz, and a central polarimeter at 30 GHz. The optical arrangement includes 5 conical corrugated feedhorns staring into a dual reflector crossed-draconian system, which provides optimal cross-polarization properties (designed to be < -35 dB) and symmetric beams. Each horn feeds a novel cryogenic on-axis rotating polar modulator which can rotate at a speed of up to 1 Hz. The science driver for this first instrument is the characterization of the galactic emission. The polarimeters use the polar modulator to derive linear polar parameters Q, U and I and switch out various systematics. The detection system provides optimum sensitivity through 2 correlated and 2 total power channels. The system is calibrated using bright polarized celestial sources and through a secondary calibration source and antenna. The acquisition system, telescope control and housekeeping are all linked through a real-time gigabit Ethernet network. All communication, power and helium gas are passed through a central rotary joint. The time stamp is synchronized to a GPS time signal. The acquisition software is based on PLCs written in Beckhoffs TwinCat and ethercat. The user interface is written in LABVIEW. The status of the QUIJOTE MFI will be presented including pre-commissioning results and laboratory testing.

Composite electrode of carbon nanotubes and vitreous carbon for electron field emission
<p>In this work, the electron field emission behaviour of electrodes formed by carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown onto monolithic vitreous carbon (VCarbon) substrates with microcavities is presented. Scanning electron microscopy was used to characterize the microstructure of the films. Tungsten probes, stainless steel sphere, and phosphor electrodes were employed in the electron field emission study. The CNT/VCarbon composite represents a route to inexpensive excellent large area electron emission cathodes with fields as low as 2.1 V mu m(-1). In preliminary lifetime tests for a period of about 24 h at an emission current of about 4 mA cm(-2), there is an onset degradation of the emission current of about 28%, which then stabilizes. Electron emission images of the composites show the cavity of the samples act as separate emission sites and predominantly control the emission process. The emission of CNTs/VCarbon was found to be stable for several hours.</p>

Long-external-cavity distributed Bragg reflector laser with subkilohertz intrinsic linewidth
We report on a simple, compact, and robust 780 nm distributed Bragg reflector laser with subkilohertz intrinsic linewidth. An external cavity with optical path length of 3.6 m, implemented with an optical fiber, reduces the laser frequency noise by several orders of magnitude. At frequencies above 100 kHz the frequency noise spectral density is reduced by over 33 dB, resulting in an intrinsic Lorentzian linewidth of 300 Hz. The remaining low-frequency noise is easily removed by stabilization to an external reference cavity. We further characterize the influence of feedback power and current variation on the intrinsic linewidth. The system is suitable for experiments requiring a tunable laser with narrow linewidth and low high-frequency noise, such as coherent optical communication, optical clocks, and cavity QED experiments.

Network ‘Small-World-Ness’: A Quantitative Method for Determining Canonical Network Equivalence
BACKGROUND: Many technological, biological, social, and information networks fall into the broad class of 'small-world' networks: they have tightly interconnected clusters of nodes, and a shortest mean path length that is similar to a matched random graph (same number of nodes and edges). This semi-quantitative definition leads to a categorical distinction ('small/not-small') rather than a quantitative, continuous grading of networks, and can lead to uncertainty about a network's small-world status. Moreover, systems described by small-world networks are often studied using an equivalent canonical network model--the Watts-Strogatz (WS) model. However, the process of establishing an equivalent WS model is imprecise and there is a pressing need to discover ways in which this equivalence may be quantified. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We defined a precise measure of 'small-world-ness' S based on the trade off between high local clustering and short path length. A network is now deemed a 'small-world' if S>1--an assertion which may be tested statistically. We then examined the behavior of S on a large data-set of real-world systems. We found that all these systems were linked by a linear relationship between their S values and the network size n. Moreover, we show a method for assigning a unique Watts-Strogatz (WS) model to any real-world network, and show analytically that the WS models associated with our sample of networks also show linearity between S and n. Linearity between S and n is not, however, inevitable, and neither is S maximal for an arbitrary network of given size. Linearity may, however, be explained by a common limiting growth process. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We have shown how the notion of a small-world network may be quantified. Several key properties of the metric are described and the use of WS canonical models is placed on a more secure footing.

Long-term negative impact on quality of life in patients with successfully treated Cushing's disease.
OBJECTIVE: A cohort of pituitary tumour patients, who had undergone definitive treatment within a 15-year period at a single neuroscience centre, were investigated as to whether there were differences in psychological well-being and psychosocial functioning, dependent on endocrine pathology and treatment variables. DESIGN: A detailed assessment of 114 patients with benign pituitary tumours in relation to primary diagnosis and mode of treatment was carried out. Psychological rating scales used were: the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale--UK version (HADS-UK), the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale--abbreviated version (WHOQOL-BREF), General Health Questionnaire 28 (GHQ-28), the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) and the Social Adjustment Scale--modified (SAS1 and SAS2; the former completed by the patient and the latter by another person who knows the patient well). All Cushing's patients were biochemically cured as defined by a normal 24-h urine free cortisol excretion within the previous 6 months. RESULTS: Patients with treated Cushing's disease had significantly impaired psychological well-being and psychosocial functioning across all tested domains compared with all other pituitary tumours, where scores were similar. When participants with Cushing's disease were excluded, patients who had undergone transfrontal surgery scored significantly higher on GHQ and HADS ratings than transsphenoidally treated patients. CONCLUSION: Cushing's disease even when biochemically stable has long-term adverse effects on mood and social functioning. We hypothesize that this may be related to irreversible changes in central neural function. Further studies are necessary to define the precise pathways involved.

<p>The electronic behavior of a radially collapsed armchair carbon nanotube encountered by scanning tunneling microscopy experiments is presented in a study that probes the electronic changes directly associated with the atomically resolved structural perturbations. The finite density of states obtained through scanning tunneling spectroscopy at the Fermi energy when the interspacing of the flattened faces does not allow for bond formation suggests that the electronic properties are slightly modified under mild radial deformations and provides a striking verification of previous theoretical predictions and discussions. The study clearly illustrates the challenges to be faced in the contacting of future nanowires, predicted to be the active component in integrated circuits.</p>

POLARISABLE ELECTROSTATICS BASED ON HIGH RANK MULTIPOLE MOMENTS TRAINED BY MACHINE LEARNING
Quantum Chemical Topology (QCT) can provide chemical insight by rigorously defining atoms and bonds from quantum mechanical wave functions. This theory has been applied towards the construction of a QCT topological multipolar force field (QCTFF) in an attempt to approach quantum mechanical (QM) accuracy, especially in the area of electrostatic interactions. This is achieved by providing a detailed representation of the electrostatic term, which replaces the typical electrostatic terms used in other popular force fields.A machine learning method called Kriging accounts for polarisation by capturing the way atomic multipole moments vary upon conformational change. The Kriging models predict the multipole moments that are used in the calculation of atom-atom electrostatic interaction energies. These predicted energies are then compared to their true values to assess the reliability of the Kriging models.The hydrogen-bonded complexes in the publicly available S22 dataset are chosen to investigate polarisation with Kriging models. Atom-atom contributions to the intramolecular and intermolecular Coulomb energy are investigated using high rank multipole moments (up to hexadecapole). The Coulomb interaction energy between two molecules in a hydrogen-bonded complex is computed by summing the additive atom-atom contributions between the molecules.The generation of training sets to populate multipole moments of each atom has also been investigated by considering the coordinate system employed to generate distorted structures. This work shows that a greater region of conformational space is spanned when generating distorted structures using redundant internal coordinates, thereby making it the superior method when randomly sampling different geometries.

[field, hysteresis, theory]

Theory of the hysteresis loop in ferromagnets
We consider three mechanisms of hysteresis phenomena in alternating magnetic field: the domain-wall motion in a random medium, the nucleation, and the retardation of magnetization due to slow (critical) fluctuations. We construct a quantitative theory for all these processes. The hysteresis is characterized by two dynamic threshold fields, a coercive field and the so-called reversal field. Their ratios to the static threshold field is shown to be a function of two dimensionless variables constituted from the frequency and amplitude of the ac field as well as from some characteristics of the magnet. The area and the shape of the hysteresis loop are found. We consider different limiting cases in which power dependencies are valid. Numerical simulations show the domain-wall formation and propagation and confirm the main theoretical predictions. Theory is compared with available experimental data. S0163-1829(98)06545-X.

Exploring Mechanisms of Variability and Predictability of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation in Two Coupled Climate Models
Multidecadal variability in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) of the ocean is diagnosed in the NCAR Community Climate System Model, version 3 (CCSM3), and the GFDL Coupled Model (CM2.1). Common diagnostic approaches are applied to draw out similarities and differences between the two models. An index of AMOC variability is defined, and the manner in which key variables covary with it is determined. In both models the following is found. (i) AMOC variability is associated with upper-ocean (top 1 km) density anomalies (dominated by temperature) on the western margin of the basin in the region of the Mann eddy with a period of about 20 years. These anomalies modulate the trajectory and strength of the North Atlantic Current. The importance of the western margin is a direct consequence of the thermal wind relation and is independent of the mechanisms that create those density anomalies. (ii) Density anomalies in this key region are part of a larger-scale pattern that propagates around the subpolar gyre and acts as a “pacemaker” of AMOC variability. (iii) The observed variability is consistent with the primary driving mechanism being stochastic wind curl forcing, with Labrador Sea convection playing a secondary role. Also, “toy models” of delayed oscillator form are fitted to power spectra of key variables and are used to infer “quality factors” (Q-factors), which characterize the bandwidth relative to the center frequency and hence AMOC predictability horizons. The two models studied here have Q-factors of around 2, suggesting that prediction is possible out to about two cycles, which is likely larger than the real AMOC.

Preoperative skin antiseptics for preventing surgical wound infections after clean surgery.
BACKGROUND: Surgical site infection rates in the month following clean surgery vary from 0.6% (knee prosthesis) to 5% (limb amputation). Due to the large number of clean surgical procedures conducted annually the costs of these surgical site infections (SSIs) can be considerable in financial and social terms. Preoperative skin antisepsis using antiseptics is performed to reduce the risk of SSIs by removing soil and transient organisms from the skin where a surgical incision will be made. Antiseptics are thought to be toxic to bacteria and therefore aid their mechanical removal. The effectiveness of preoperative skin preparation is thought to be dependent on both the antiseptic used and the method of application, however, it is unclear whether preoperative skin antisepsis actually reduces postoperative wound infection, and, if so, which antiseptic is most effective. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether preoperative skin antisepsis immediately prior to surgical incision for clean surgery prevents SSI and to determine the comparative effectiveness of alternative antiseptics. SEARCH METHODS: For this second update we searched the The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 7 August 2012), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE  (1950 to July Week 4 2012), Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations August 06, 2012), Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 2012 Week 31), EBSCO CINAHL (2007 to 3 August 2012). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials evaluating the use of preoperative skin antiseptics applied immediately prior to incision in clean surgery. There was no restriction on the inclusion of reports based on language of publication, date or publication status. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction and assessment of risk of bias were undertaken independently by two review authors. MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included in this review (2,623 participants). These evaluated several different types of skin antiseptics - leading to 11 different comparisons being made. Although the antiseptics evaluated differed between studies, all trials involved some form of iodine. Iodine in alcohol was compared to alcohol alone in one trial; one trial compared povidone iodine paint (solution type not reported) with soap and alcohol. Six studies compared different types of iodine-containing products with each other and five compared iodine-containing products with chlorhexidine-containing products.There was evidence from one study suggesting that preoperative skin preparation with 0.5% chlorhexidine in methylated spirits led to a reduced risk of SSI compared with an alcohol based povidone iodine solution: RR 0.47 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.82). However, it is important to note that the trial does not report important details regarding the interventions (such as the concentration of povidone iodine paint used) and trial conduct, such that risk of bias was unclear.There were no other statistically significant differences in SSI rates in the other comparisons of skin antisepsis. Overall the risk of bias in included studies was unclear.A mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis was conducted and this suggested that alcohol-containing products had the highest probability of being effective - however, again the quality of this evidence was low. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive review of current evidence found some evidence that preoperative skin preparation with 0.5% chlorhexidine in methylated spirits was associated with lower rates of SSIs following clean surgery than alcohol-based povidone iodine paint. However this single study was poorly reported. Practitioners may therefore elect to consider other characteristics such as costs and potential side effects when choosing between alternatives.The design of future trials should be driven by the questions of high priority to decision makers. It may be that investment in at least one large trial (in terms of participants) is warranted in order to add definitive and hopefully conclusive data to the current evidence base. Ideally any future trial would evaluate the iodine-containing and chlorhexidine-containing solutions relevant to current practice as well as the type of solution used (alcohol vs. aqueous).

Motivational interviewing and interaction skills training for parents to change cannabis use in young adults with recent-onset schizophrenia: a randomized controlled trial.
BACKGROUND: Cannabis use by people with schizophrenia has been found to be associated with family distress and poor clinical outcomes. Interventions to reduce drug use in this patient group have had limited efficacy. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a novel intervention for parents of young adults with recent-onset schizophrenia consisting of family-based motivational interviewing and interaction skills (Family Motivational Intervention, FMI) in comparison with routine family support (RFS). METHOD: In a trial with 75 patients who used cannabis and received treatment for recent-onset schizophrenia, 97 parents were randomly assigned to either FMI (n=53) or RFS (n=44). Assessments were conducted at baseline and 3 months after completion of the family intervention by an investigator who remained blind throughout the study about the assignment of the parents. RESULTS: At follow-up, patients' frequency and quantity of cannabis use was significantly more reduced in FMI than in RFS (p<0.05 and p<0.04 respectively). Patients' craving for cannabis was also significantly reduced in FMI whereas there was a small increase in RFS (p=0.01). There was no difference between FMI and RFS with regard to patients' other substance use and general level of functioning. Both groups showed significant improvements in parental distress and sense of burden. CONCLUSIONS: Training parents in motivational interviewing and interaction skills is feasible and effective in reducing cannabis use among young adults with recent-onset schizophrenia. However, FMI was not more effective than RFS in increasing patients' general level of functioning and in reducing parents' stress and sense of burden.

Rapidly progressive polyneuropathy due to dry beriberi in a man: a case report.
INTRODUCTION: We describe a case of rapidly progressive and severely debilitating polyneuropathy in a patient with confirmed hypovitaminosis B1, consistent with dry beriberi. Crucially, this is a treatable condition, although sometimes with incomplete recovery, but it is probably under-recognized yet increasingly common given increasing levels of alcohol abuse in the western world. CASE PRESENTATION: A 49-year-old Caucasian British man presented with progressive weakness of both lower limbs of approximately seven months' duration. He noted difficulty climbing stairs. He also complained of lethargy, and loss of muscle bulk, including his thighs. He had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and admitted prior alcohol abuse but denied excessive alcohol intake in the five years prior to presentation. Initial clinical and neurophysiological examinations were consistent with a mild peripheral neuropathy and probable proximal myopathy. However, over the subsequent four months he evolved a marked tetraparesis, with profound sensory disturbance of all limbs. Repeat neurophysiology revealed a widespread polyneuropathy with extensive acute and sub-acute denervation changes in all four limbs, and reduced or absent sensory nerve action potentials. Hypovitaminosis B1 was confirmed (45 nmol/L, reference range 66-200 nmol/L). His rapid clinical deterioration was in keeping with dry beriberi. He was treated with thiamine. Subsequent follow-up revealed slow but significant improvement, such that by 15-16 months from the initial onset of symptoms, and approximately six months after the onset of his marked tetraparesis, he was able to stand independently and was gradually gaining confidence in walking pending a period of in-patient neurorehabilitation. CONCLUSION: A potentially wide differential diagnosis exists for this type of presentation. Confirming hypovitaminosis B1 by requesting the assay prior to vitamin replacement ensures accurate diagnosis and appropriate ongoing treatment. An increasingly high index of suspicion is likely to be required in the context of increasing levels of alcohol abuse in the western world and the possible increasing prevalence of dry beriberi.

[cav-1, stromal, prostate, epithelial, cancer, level, disease]

An absence of stromal caveolin-1 is associated with advanced prostate cancer, metastatic disease and epithelial Akt activation.
Here, we examined the status of stromal Cav-1 expression in patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), primary prostate cancers (PCa), and prostate-cancer metastases (Mets). Interestingly, an absence of stromal Cav-1 directly correlated with prostate cancer disease progression. For example, virtually all BPH samples showed abundant stromal Cav-1 immunostaining. In contrast, in a subset of patients with primary prostate cancer, the stromal levels of Cav-1 were significantly decreased, and this correlated with a high Gleason score, indicative of a worse prognosis and poor clinical outcome. Remarkably, all metastatic tumors (either from lymph node or bone) were completely negative for stromal Cav-1 staining. Thus, stromal Cav-1 expression may be considered as a new biomarker of prostate cancer disease progression and metastasis. Mechanistically, stromal Cav-1 levels were inversely correlated with the epithelial expression levels of Cav-1 and epithelial phospho-Akt. Thus, loss of stromal Cav-1 is predictive of elevated levels of epithelial Cav-1 and epithelial Akt-activation. This provides important new clinical evidence for paracrine signaling between prostate cancer epithelial cells and the tumor stromal micro-environment, especially related to disease progression and metastasis.

Developing Multilingual Text Mining Workflows in UIMA and U-Compare Natural Language Processing and Information Systems
We present a generic, language-independent method for the construction of multilingual text mining workflows. The proposed mechanism is implemented as an extension of U-Compare, a platform built on top of the Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) that allows the construction, comparison and evaluation of interoperable text mining workflows. UIMA was previously supporting strictly monolingual workflows. Building multilingual workflows exhibits challenging problems, such as representing multilingual document collections and executing language-dependent components in parallel. As an application of our method, we develop a multilingual workflow that extracts terms from a parallel collection using a new heuristic. For our experiments, we construct a parallel corpus consisting of approximately 188.000 PubMed article titles for French and English. Our application is evaluated against a popular monolingual term extraction method, C Value.

Degenerate Periodic Orbits and Homoclinic Torus Bifurcation
<p>A one-parameter family of periodic orbits with frequency omega and energy E of an autonomous Hamiltonian system is degenerate when E-'(omega)=0. In this paper, new features of the nonlinear bifurcation near this degeneracy are identified. A new normal form is found where the coefficient of the nonlinear term is determined by the curvature of the energy-frequency map. An important property of the bifurcating "homoclinic torus" is the homoclinic angle and a new asymptotic formula for it is derived. The theory is constructive, and so is useful for physical applications and in numerics.</p>

Residual stress effects on the fracture toughness behaviour of a narrow-gap austenitic stainless steel pipe weld
Automated narrow-gap girth-butt welds are replacing conventional welding methods to join sections of austenitic stainless steel pipe in the primary circuit of Pressurised Water Reactors, to reduce manufacturing costs and improve quality. To ensure the safe operation of these systems, reliable structural integrity assessments have to be undertaken, requiring the mechanical properties of welded joints to be characterised alongside the weld residual stress magnitude and distribution.This research project characterised, for the first time, the weld residual stress field and the tensile and ductile fracture toughness properties of a 33 mm thick narrow-gap 304L stainless steel pipe weld. The residual stress was characterised using two complementary approaches: deep hole drilling and neutron diffraction. A novel neutron diffraction scanning technique was developed to characterise the residual stress field, without cutting an access window into the component, leaving the original weld residual stress field undisturbed. A modified deep hole drilling technique was developed to characterise the residual stress retained in fracture mechanics specimens extracted from the pipe weld in two orientations. The modified technique was shown to measure the original weld residual stress field more accurately than through conventional deep hole drilling. Residual stresses, exceeding 50% of the weld material proof strength, were retained in axially-orientated fracture mechanics specimens.Tensile tests showed that the weld was approximately 60% overmatched. It was demonstrated that neither retained residual stress, nor specimen orientation, had a discernible effect on the measured fracture toughness of the weld material. In less ductile materials, however, the level of retained residual stress may unduly influence the measurement of fracture toughness. At initiation, the fracture toughness properties of both the parent and weld materials were far in excess of the measuring capacity of the largest fracture mechanics specimens that could be machined from the weld.The influence of residual stress and fracture toughness on the performance of narrow-gap welded pipework was investigated. Full elastic-plastic finite element analyses were used to model the pipe weld, containing a postulated defect under combined primary and secondary loading. The results, applied within the framework of an R6 structural integrity assessment, compared different plasticity interaction parameters on the prediction of failure load; the conventional ρ-parameter approach was compared with the recently developed, more advanced, g-parameter. It was shown that the g-parameter significantly reduced the conservatism of the ρ-parameter approach. However, for this pipe weld, plastic collapse was predicted to precede failure by ductile initiation, suggesting that a plastic collapse solution may be an appropriate failure criterion to use in structural integrity assessments of similar component and defect combinations.

[hair, growth, human, model, cycle]

A prototypic mathematical model of the human hair cycle.
The human hair cycle is a complex, dynamic organ-transformation process during which the hair follicle repetitively progresses from a growth phase (anagen) to a rapid apoptosis-driven involution (catagen) and finally a relative quiescent phase (telogen) before returning to anagen. At present no theory satisfactorily explains the origin of the hair cycle rhythm. Based on experimental evidence we propose a prototypic model that focuses on the dynamics of hair matrix keratinocytes. We argue that a plausible feedback-control structure between two key compartments (matrix keratinocytes and dermal papilla) leads to dynamic instabilities in the population dynamics resulting in rhythmic hair growth. The underlying oscillation consists of an autonomous switching between two quasi-steady states. Additional features of the model, namely bistability and excitability, lead to new hypotheses about the impact of interventions on hair growth. We show how in silico testing may facilitate testing of candidate hair growth modulatory agents in human HF organ culture or in clinical trials.

Analysis of elastic strain and crystallographic texture in poled rhombohedral PZT ceramics
The elastic strain and crystallographic texture of a rhombohedral lead zirconate titanate ceramic have been characterised in the remanent state, after poling, using high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction as a function of the grain orientation psi relative to the poling direction. It is observed that the (200) diffraction peak exhibits pronounced shifts as a function of psi, indicating an elastic lattice strain, while others ({111}, {112} and {220}) show marked changes in intensity as a result of preferred ferroelectric domain orientation. It is shown that the (200) peak is not affected by the domain switching itself but rather acts like an elastic macrostrain sensor. A simple Eshelby analysis is used to demonstrate that both the elastic strain and texture vary systematically with psi according to the factor (3cos(2)psi-1). This angular dependence is evaluated through micromechanics modelling. The physical meaning of the texture variations with psi is also discussed. (c) 2006 Acta Materialia Inc.

[keloid, ft-ir, tissue, microspectroscopy, section]

Phenotypic profiling of keloid scars using FT-IR microspectroscopy reveals a unique spectral signature.
Keloid disease (KD) is a quasineoplastic fibroproliferative tumour of unknown origin causing a progressive, recurrent dermal lesion. KD is not homogeneous in nature and shows phenotypic structural differences between its distinct peripheral margins compared to its centre. The keloid margin is often symptomatically more active with increased dermal cellularity, compared to a symptomatically dormant and hypocellular centre of lesion. The aim of this study was to delineate the morphological components of a keloid scar tissue by measuring the differences between various anatomical locations within the keloid tissue, such as the margin and the centre of the lesion compared to its surrounding normal skin using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy. FT-IR microspectroscopy is a technique that produces spectra with detailed molecular biochemical information inherent of the chemical structure. Chemical maps were constructed on extralesional cross sections taken from six keloid scars. H&E stained sections were used to confirm diagnosis of keloid and orientate the experimental cross sections prior to FT-IR. Spectral band assignment and principal components analysis were conducted. Distinct vibrational bands (100 spectra) were observed using FT-IR spectroscopy. Partial least squares discriminant analysis, with bootstrapping (10,000 analyses), identified whether a spectrum was from the keloid or normal tissue showing an average accuracy of 84.8%, precision of 80.4%, specificity of 76.2%, and sensitivity of 92.9%. FT-IR microspectroscopy showed significant differences in spectral profiles in keloid tissue in different anatomical locations within the cross section. We believe that this proof-of-concept study may help substantiate the use of FTIR spectroscopy in keloid diagnosis and prognosis.

Forty patients with irritable bowel syndrome received an antigen-exclusion diet identical to that previously reported to be highly effective in this condition. Only 15% of the group as a whole showed evidence of food intolerance manifested by an improvement in their irritable bowel symptoms. In a further 12.5% only well-being improved and this did not seem to be related to the exclusion of any particular food. Patients whose bowel dysfunction was characterized by diarrhea responded the best (3/8) whereas those with constipation consistently failed to improve.

Are district general hospital patients with unstable angina at a disadvantage?
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes requiring coronary angiography and revascularisation have inferior access to these services if admitted to district general hospitals (DGHs) compared with similar patients admitted to a base hospital containing a tertiary cardiac centre. DESIGN: Prospective, consecutive monitoring of all patients with acute coronary syndromes accepted by the tertiary cardiac centre for angiography and revascularisation over a three month period (1 April to 30 June 2002). PARTICIPANTS: All patients accepted for angiography from DGHs and from within the base hospital with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes. SETTING: Tertiary cardiac facility (Manchester Heart Centre at Manchester Royal Infirmary (MRI)). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Time waited from referral to angiography and revascularisation. RESULTS: A total of 184 patients with a diagnosis of non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes underwent angiography with a view to revascularisation. Of these, 89 (48%) were admitted initially to MRI and 95 (52%) were admitted to a feeder DGH. DGH patients waited significantly longer from admission to angiography than MRI patients (median 13 days (25th-75th percentiles 7-19) v 5 days (3-8) respectively; p<0.0005). DGH patients therefore also waited longer from admission to revascularisation (15 days (6-20) v 6 days (3-9) respectively). Once transferred into the Manchester Heart Centre, DGH patients underwent angiography within a median of 1 day (1-2). More DGH patients than those from MRI underwent both coronary artery bypass grafting (21 (22%) v 8 (9%) respectively; p=0.015) and percutaneous coronary intervention (44 (46%) v 32 (36%) respectively; p=NS). CONCLUSION: Patients admitted to feeder DGHs with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes wait significantly longer for access to invasive coronary assessment and revascularisation than similar patients admitted in the hospital that incorporates the tertiary cardiac centre. This inequity of access is determined by postcode rather than clinical priority.

[rassf1a, hypertrophy, mouse, ra, heart, cardiac]

Tumor suppressor Ras-association domain family 1 isoform A is a novel regulator of cardiac hypertrophy.
BACKGROUND: Ras signaling regulates a number of important processes in the heart, including cell growth and hypertrophy. Although it is known that defective Ras signaling is associated with Noonan, Costello, and other syndromes that are characterized by tumor formation and cardiac hypertrophy, little is known about factors that may control it. Here we investigate the role of Ras effector Ras-association domain family 1 isoform A (RASSF1A) in regulating myocardial hypertrophy. METHODS AND RESULTS: A significant downregulation of RASSF1A expression was observed in hypertrophic mouse hearts, as well as in failing human hearts. To further investigate the role of RASSF1A in cardiac (patho)physiology, we used RASSF1A knock-out (RASSF1A(-)(/)(-)) mice and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with adenoviral overexpression of RASSF1A. Ablation of RASSF1A in mice significantly enhanced the hypertrophic response to transverse aortic constriction (64.2% increase in heart weight/body weight ratio in RASSF1A(-)(/)(-) mice compared with 32.4% in wild type). Consistent with the in vivo data, overexpression of RASSF1A in cardiomyocytes markedly reduced the cellular hypertrophic response to phenylephrine stimulation. Analysis of molecular signaling events in isolated cardiomyocytes indicated that RASSF1A inhibited extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 activation, likely by blocking the binding of Raf1 to active Ras. CONCLUSIONS: Our data establish RASSF1A as a novel inhibitor of cardiac hypertrophy by modulating the extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 pathway.

Genome-Environment Interactions That Modulate Aging: Powerful Targets for Drug Discovery.
Aging is the major biomedical challenge of this century. The percentage of elderly people, and consequently the incidence of age-related diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases, is projected to increase considerably in the coming decades. Findings from model organisms have revealed that aging is a surprisingly plastic process that can be manipulated by both genetic and environmental factors. Here we review a broad range of findings in model organisms, from environmental to genetic manipulations of aging, with a focus on those with underlying gene-environment interactions with potential for drug discovery and development. One well-studied dietary manipulation of aging is caloric restriction, which consists of restricting the food intake of organisms without triggering malnutrition and has been shown to retard aging in model organisms. Caloric restriction is already being used as a paradigm for developing compounds that mimic its life-extension effects and might therefore have therapeutic value. The potential for further advances in this field is immense; hundreds of genes in several pathways have recently emerged as regulators of aging and caloric restriction in model organisms. Some of these genes, such as IGF1R and FOXO3, have also been associated with human longevity in genetic association studies. The parallel emergence of network approaches offers prospects to develop multitarget drugs and combinatorial therapies. Understanding how the environment modulates aging-related genes may lead to human applications and disease therapies through diet, lifestyle, or pharmacological interventions. Unlocking the capacity to manipulate human aging would result in unprecedented health benefits.

The design of a new high-performance computing platform to model biological neural networks requires scalable, layered communications in both hardware and software. SpiNNaker’s hardware is based upon Multi-Processor System-on-Chips (MPSoCs) with flexible, power-efficient, custom communication between processors and chips. The architecture scales from a single 18-processor chip to over 1 million processors and to simulations of billion-neuron, trillion-synapse models, with tens of trillions of neural spike-event packets conveyed each second. The communication networks and overlying protocols are key to the successful operation of the SpiNNaker architecture, designed together to maximise performance and minimise the power demands of the platform. SpiNNaker is a work in progress, having recently reached a major milestone with the delivery of the first MPSoCs. This paper presents the architectural justification, which is now supported by preliminary measured results of silicon performance, indicating that it is indeed scalable to a million-plus processor system.

"Prehabilitation" prior to CABG surgery improves physical functioning and depression.
BACKGROUND: Many patients demonstrate psychological distress and reduced physical activity before coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Here we evaluated the addition of a brief, cognitive-behavioural intervention (the HeartOp Programme) to routine nurse counselling for people waiting for CABG surgery. METHODS: Randomised controlled trial comparing nurse counselling with the HeartOp programme to routine nurse counselling in 204 patients awaiting first time elective CABG. Primary outcome measures were: anxiety and length of hospital stay; secondary outcome measures were: depression, physical functioning, cardiac misconceptions and cost utility. Measures were collected prior to randomisation and after 8 weeks of their intervention prior to surgery, excepting length of hospital stay which was collected after discharge following surgery. RESULTS: 100 patients were randomised to intervention, 104 to control. At follow-up there were no differences in anxiety or length of hospital stay. There were significant differences in depression (difference=7.79, p=0.008, 95% CI=2.04-13.54), physical functioning (difference=0.82, p=0.001, 95%CI=0.34-1.3) and cardiac misconceptions (difference=2.56, p<0.001, 95%CI=1.64-3.48) in favour of the HeartOp Programme. The only difference to be maintained following surgery was in cardiac misconceptions. The HeartOp Programme was found to have an Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) of pound 288.83 per Quality-Adjusted Life Year. CONCLUSIONS: Nurse counselling with the HeartOp Programme reduces depression and cardiac misconceptions and improves physical functioning before bypass surgery significantly more than nurse counselling alone and meets the accepted criteria for cost efficacy.

Peripatellar synovitis: comparison between non-contrast-enhanced and contrast-enhanced MRI and association with pain. The MOST study.
PURPOSE: To assess the diagnostic performance of signal changes in Hoffa's fat pad (HFP) assessed on non-contrast-enhanced (CE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detecting synovitis, and the association of pain with signal changes in HFP on non-CE MRI and peripatellar synovial thickness on CE MRI. METHODS: The Multicenter Osteoarthritis (MOST) Study is an observational study of individuals who have or are at high risk for knee OA. All subjects with available non-CE and CE MRIs were included. Signal changes in HFP were scored from 0 to 3 in two regions using non-CE MRI. Synovial thickness was scored from 0 to 2 on CE MRI in five peripatellar regions. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of HFP signal changes were calculated considering synovial thickness on CE MRI as the reference standard. We used logistic regression to assess the associations of HFP changes (non-CE MRI) and synovial thickness (CE MRI) with pain from walking up or down stairs, after adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: A total of 393 subjects were included. Sensitivity of infrapatellar and intercondylar signal changes in HFP was high (71% and 88%), but specificity was low (55% and 30%). No significant associations were found between HFP changes on non-CE MRI and pain. Grade 2 synovial thickness assessed on CE MRI was significantly associated with pain after adjustments for potential confounders. CONCLUSION: Signal changes in HFP detected on non-CE MRI are a sensitive but non-specific surrogate for the assessment of synovitis. CE MRI identifies associations with pain better than non-CE MRI.

[patient, control, ib, synesthesium, sensory, reproducibility]

Synesthesia, pseudo-synesthesia, and irritable bowel syndrome.
BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Synesthesia is a sensory disorder where the stimulation of one sensory modality can lead to a reaction in another which would not usually be expected to respond; for instance, someone might see a color on hearing a word such as a day of the week. Disordered perception of sensory information also appears to contribute to the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The purpose of this exploratory study was to ascertain whether these two conditions might be linked in any way. METHODS: Two hundred consecutive IBS outpatients were screened for synesthesia and compared with 200 matched healthy volunteers (controls). Positive responders were tested for two types of synesthesia (grapheme-color and music-color/shape) using a questionnaire which was repeated after 3 months to test for reproducibility. RESULTS: Of the 200 IBS outpatients screened, 26 (13%) patients and six (3%) controls claimed to be synesthetic (P < 0.001). Reproducibility was more variable in IBS patients than controls but despite this variability, 15 (7.5%) patients compared with 5 (2.5%) controls had greater than 75% consistency (P = 0.036), and 19 (9.5%) patients and 6 (3%) controls had greater than 50% consistency (P = 0.012). A reproducibility of less than 50% was observed in seven (3.5%) patients and no controls (0%) (P = 0.015), and these individuals were classified as having pseudo-synesthesia. CONCLUSION: IBS patients clearly differ from controls in terms of claiming to have synesthetic experiences. These results justify additional studies on the relationship between IBS and synesthesia to further understand the neural mechanisms underpinning these two conditions and to establish whether they may be linked.

Flavonoid Mixture Analysis by Matrix-Assisted Diffusion-Ordered Spectroscopy
The structural similarity of flavonoids, often present in natural product mixtures, makes their analysis by NMR methods less than straightforward. This similarity is a dual problem for one of the most powerful NMR methods for mixture analysis, diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY), which relies both on well-resolved peaks and on differences in hydrodynamic radii for separating the signals from different components in a mixture. To overcome these limitations, we use a matrix-assisted DOSY approach that exploits differential chemical interactions with a slow diffusion matrix (here micellar sodium dodecyl sulfate) to resolve flavonoid mixtures in mixed solvents.The structural similarity of flavonoids, often present in natural product mixtures, makes their analysis by NMR methods less than straightforward.

Transmission Electron Microscopy Study of Graphite under in situ Ion Irradiation
Graphite is employed as a moderator and structural component in 18 of the United Kingdom’s fleet of  Magnox and Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors (AGRs). During the operational lifetime of a reactor, graphite undergoes complex physical and mechanical property changes including dimensional modification, owing to the effects of temperature, oxidation and irradiation-induced atomic displacements. In order to safely extend the lifetime of the current fleet of AGRs, and also to develop materials for GenIV concepts such as the Very-HighTemperature Reactor (VHTR), it is important to gain a better understanding of the fundamental atomic processes which underpin the behaviour of graphite under current and future operational conditions. This study has focused on the effects of temperature and displacing radiation on the evolution of Mrozowski cracks in highly-orientated pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) using the new Microscope and Ion Accelerator for Materials Investigations (MIAMI) facility. This instrument allows transmission electron microscopy to be performed  in situ whilst simultaneously ion irradiating to radiation damage levels typically reached in a reactor. By using this technique, it is possible to explore the development of radiation damage under a range of different conditions continuously from start-to-finish rather than just observing the end-states accessible in ex situ studies.

Modelling Surface Waves using the Hypersingular Boundary Element Method
The theme of the research is on the use of the hypersingular boundary element method for the modelling of surface waves. Surface waves in solids are known to be partially reflected & transmitted and mode converted into body waves at stress discontinuities, which suggests that a formulation continuous in stress and strain might prove beneficial for modelling purposes. Such continuity can be achieved with a subparametric approach where the geometry is approximated using linear elements and the field variables, displacement and traction, are approximated using cubic Hermitian and linear shape functions respectively. The higher order polynomial for approximating displacement is intended to be a more accurate representation of the physics relating to surface wave phenomena, especially at corners, and thus, is expected to capture this behaviour with greater accuracy than the standard isoparametric approach. The subparametric approach affords itself to continuity in stress and strain by imposing a smoothness in the elements, which is not available to the isoparametric approach. As the attention is focused primarily on the modelling of surface waves on the boundary of a medium rather than the interior, the boundary element method lends itself appropriately to this end.A 2D semi analytical integration scheme is employed to evaluate the integrals appearing in the hypersingular boundary integral formulation. The integration scheme is designed to reduce the errors incurred when integrals with singular integrands are evaluated numerically. The scheme involves the application of Taylor expansions to formulate the integrals into two parts. One part is regular and is evaluated numerically and the other part is singular but sufficiently simple to be evaluated analytically. The scheme makes use of the aforementioned subparametric approach and is applied to linear elements for the use in steady state elastodynamic boundary element method problems. The steady state problem is used as it is a simplified problem and is sufficient to permit the investigation of surface vibration at a constant motion. The 2D semi analytical integration scheme presented can be naturally extended to 3D.A particular focus and novelty of the work is the application of different limiting approaches to determine the free terms common to boundary integral methods. The accurate numerical solution of hypersingular boundary integral equations necessitates the precise evaluation of free terms, which are required to counter discontinuous and often unbounded behaviour of hypersingular integrals at a boundary. The common approach for the evaluation of free terms involves integration over a portion of a circular/spherical shaped surface centred at a singularity and allowing the radius of the circle/sphere to tend to zero. This approach is revisited in order to ascertain whether incorrect results are possible as a consequence of shape dependency, which is a recognised issue for hypersingular integrals.Two alternative methods, which are shape invariant, are proposed and investigated for the determination of free terms. The first approach, the point limiting method, involves moving a singularity towards a shrinking integration domain at a faster rate than the domain shrinks. Issues surrounding the choice of approach, shrinkage rates and path dependency are examined. A related and second approach, the boundary limiting method, involves moving an invariant, but shrinking, boundary toward the singularity, again at a faster rate than the shrinkage of the domain. The latter method can be viewed as a vanishing exclusion zone approach but the actual boundary shape is used for the boundary of the exclusion zone. Both these methods are shown to provide consistent answers and can be shown to be directly related to the result obtained by moving a singularity towards a boundary, that is, by comparison with the direct method. Unlike the circular/spherical approach the two methods involve integration over the actual boundary shape and consequently shape dependency is not an issue. A particular highlight of the point limiting approach is the ability to obtain free terms in mixed formulation, which is not available to the circular/spherical approach.There are three numerical problems considered in this research. The first problem considers the longitudinal vibration of a square plate. This is a problem for which a known analytical solution exists and is used to verify the equation formulation and integration scheme adopted for the isoparametric and subparametric formulations. Both formulations are as accurate as each other and produce results that are in keeping with the analytical solution, thus instilling confidence in their predictions.The second problem considers the simulation of surface waves on a square plate. Various boundaries of a square plate have displacement conditions imposed on them as a result of surface wave propagation. The results indicate that the surface wave behaviour is not captured. However, the analytical solution does not make any consideration for the effects from corners; the analytical solution is for a Rayleigh wave propagating upon a planar surface. It does not take into account the wave phenomena encountered at corners. Therefore, these results cannot be used to validate the predictions obtained on the boundary of the problem considered. The purpose of this problem is to illustrate the impact of corners on the surface wave propagation. Sensitivity studies are conducted to illustrate the effect of corners on the computed solution at the boundary.The final problem considers the simulation of surface waves on a circular plate. Various portions of the boundary of the circular plate have displacement conditions imposed on them as a result of surface wave propagation on curved surfaces. The results indicate that the isoparametric and subparametric predictions are similar to one another. However, both displacement profiles predict the presence of other waves. Given the multi faceted nature of the mesh, the computed solution is picking up mode conversion and partial reflection & transmission of surface waves. In reality, this is not expected as the surface of the boundary is smooth. However, due to the discretisation there are many corners in this problem.

Morphology, mechanisms and pathology of musculoskeletal ageing.
In general terms, the recognized alterations in circulating humoral factors (hormones, cytokines, growth factors) that occur in ageing, coupled with innate cellular senescence exaggerated by the slow turnover of many connective tissue cell populations and the age-associated alterations in matrix molecule cross-linking, predispose the elderly to altered connective tissue biology. These changes can be profound, leading to poor mobility, altered ability to withstand cold, weakness and an increased risk of falls, fractures and age-associated 'degenerative' diseases, such as osteoarthritis and osteoporosis. As understanding of the causes of altered connective tissue function with age increases, it is becoming clearer that many of the predisposing factors (growth hormone, cytokines, load/life style) are potential targets for improving quality of life in the elderly.

Ultrastructural features of phagocytosis and intracellular killing of Candida albicans by mouse polymorphonuclear phagocyte monolayers.
Phagocyte monolayers provided a simple method of following ultrastructural events associated with phagocytosis and intracellular killing of Candida albicans. Preformed monolayers of mouse polymorphonuclear (PMN) phagocytes attached to glass coverslips were incubated with blastospore phase C. albicans and then examined by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Scanning electron microscopy revealed phagocytosis of C. albicans by mouse phagocytes. Ingestion of the organism was facilitated by the production of lamellipodia by the phagocytes. Transmission electron microscopy revealed complete phagocytosis of C. albicans and the fusion of lysosomal granules with loose and tight phagosomes. Ingested C. albicans remained structurally intact after 2 hr incubation in blastospore-free medium. However, cytoplasmic alterations were clearly evident, with a patchy loss of electron density. Alterations of the blastospore cell wall were also observed, with complete disruption of the plasma membrane but the wall remaining morphologically intact.

The association between social deprivation and the prevalence and severity of dental caries and fluorosis in populations with and without water fluoridation.
UNLABELLED: ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: To determine the association between social deprivation and the prevalence of caries (including caries lesions restricted to enamel) and enamel fluorosis in areas that are served by either fluoridated or non-fluoridated drinking water using clinical scoring, remote blinded, photographic scoring for caries and fluorosis. The study also aimed to explore the use of remote, blinded methodologies to minimize the effect of examiner bias. METHODS: Subjects were male and female lifetime residents aged 11-13 years. Clinical assessments of caries and fluorosis were performed on permanent teeth using ICDAS and blind scoring of standardized photographs of maxillary central incisors using TF Index (with cases for fluorosis defined as TF > 0). RESULTS: Data from 1783 subjects were available (910 Newcastle, 873 Manchester). Levels of material deprivation (Index of Multiple Deprivation) were comparable for both populations (Newcastle mean 35.22, range 2.77-78.85; Manchester mean 37.04, range 1.84-84.02). Subjects in the fluoridated population had significantly less caries experience than the non-fluoridated population when assessed by clinical scores or photographic scores across all quintiles of deprivation for white spot lesions: Newcastle mean DMFT 2.94 (clinical); 2.51 (photo), Manchester mean DMFT 4.48 (clinical); 3.44 (photo) and caries into dentine (Newcastle Mean DMFT 0.65 (clinical); 0.58 (photo), Manchester mean DMFT 1.07 (clinical); 0.98 (photo). The only exception being for the least deprived quintile for caries into dentine where there were no significant differences between the cities: Newcastle mean DMFT 0.38 (clinical); 0.36 (photo), Manchester mean DMFT 0.45 (clinical); 0.39 (photo). The odds ratio for white spot caries experience (or worse) in Manchester was 1.9 relative to Newcastle. The odds ratio for caries into dentine in Manchester was 1.8 relative to Newcastle. The odds ratio for developing fluorosis in Newcastle was 3.3 relative to Manchester. CONCLUSIONS: Water fluoridation appears to reduce the social class gradient between deprivation and caries experience when considering caries into dentine. However, this was associated with an increased risk of developing mild fluorosis. The use of intra-oral cameras and remote scoring of photographs for caries demonstrated good potential for blinded scoring.

Left-handed metamaterials realized by complementary split-ring resonators for RF and microwave circuit applications
A new equivalent circuit of left-handed (LH) microstrip transmission line loaded with Complementary split-ring resonators (CSRRs) is presented. By adding the magnetic coupling into the equivalent circuit, the new equivalent circuit presents a more accurate cutoff frequency than the old one. The group delay of CSRRs applied with microstrip transmission line (TL) is also studied and analyzed into two cases which are passive CSRRs delay line and active CSRRs delay line. In the first case, the CSRRs TL is analyzed. The group delay can be varied and controlled via signal frequency which does not happen in a normal TL. In the active CSRRs delay line, the CSRRs loaded with TL is fixed. The diodes are added to the model between the strip and CSRRs. By observing a specific frequency at 2.03GHz after bias DC voltages from -10V to -20V, the group delay can be moved from 0.6ns to 5.6ns. A novel microstrip filter is presented by embedding CSRRs on the ground plane of microstrip filter. The filter characteristic is changed from a 300MHz narrowband to a 1GHz wideband as well as suppression the occurrence of previous higher spurious frequency at 3.9GHz. Moreover, a high rejection in the lower band and a low insertion loss of <1dB are achieved.Finally, it is shown that CSRRs applied with planar antenna can reduce the antenna size. The structure is formed by etching CSRRs on the ground side of the patch antenna. The meander line part is also added on the antenna patch to tune the operation frequency from 1.8GHz downward to 1.73GHz which can reduce the antenna size to 74% of conventional patch antennas. By using the previous antenna structure without meander line, this proposed antenna can be tuned for selecting the operation frequency, by embedding a diode connected the position between patch and ground. The results provide 350MHz tuning range with 35MHz bandwidth.

Attenuation of Phencyclidine-Induced Object Recognition Deficits by the Combination of Atypical Antipsychotic Drugs and Pimavanserin (ACP 103), a 5-Hydroxytryptamine2A Receptor Inverse Agonist
Subchronic administration of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, phencyclidine (PCP), in rodents has been shown to produce impairment in novel object recognition (NOR), a model of visual learning and memory. We tested the hypothesis that the selective 5-HT(2A) inverse agonists, pimavanserin and (R)-(+)-alpha-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-2-(4-fluorophenylethyl-4-piperidinemethanol (M100907), would potentiate subeffective doses of atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) to reverse the NOR deficits. Female rats received vehicle or PCP (2 mg/kg b.i.d.) for 7 days, followed by a 7-day washout. Pimavanserin (3 mg/kg) or M100907 (1 mg/kg) alone, or four atypicial APDs, risperidone (0.05-0.1 mg/kg), melperone (1-3 mg/kg), olanzapine (1-2 mg/kg), or N-desmethylclozapine (1-2 mg/kg), and the typical APD, haloperidol (0.05-0.1 mg/kg), were administered alone, or in combination with pimavanserin or M100907, before NOR testing. The exploration times of objects during 3-min acquisition and retention trials, separated by a 1-min interval, were compared by analysis of variance. Vehicle-, but not PCP-treated, animals, explored the novel object significantly more than the familiar in the retention trial (p < 0.05-0.01). Pretreatment with the higher doses of the atypical APDs, but not pimavanserin, M100907, or haloperidol alone, reversed the effects of PCP. The effect of risperidone was blocked by haloperidol pretreatment. Coadministration of pimavanserin or M100907, with ineffective doses of the atypical APDs, but not haloperidol, also reversed the PCP-induced deficit in NOR. These results support the importance of 5-hydroxytryptamine(2A) receptor blockade relative to D(2) receptor blockade in the ability of atypicals to ameliorate the effect of subchronic PCP, a putative measure of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.

Business Regulation, Inward Foreign Direct Investment, and Economic Growth in the New European Union Member States
Purpose â The purpose of this paper is to assess the extent to which institutional convergence has taken place in the new European Union (EU) member states. It does so by contrasting arguments that are inspired by transaction-cost economics within the mainstream international-business literature and contentions within the comparative-capitalisms perspective. A corollary of arguments within the
former is that those countries that have less transparent ways of doing business will post poorer economic growth records than those with more predictable and less costly regulations. By contrast, contentions within the comparative-capitalisms literature lead to expectations that a broader set of institutional factors will shape economic growth.

Design/methodology/approach â The article adopts a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis approach to examine the necessary and sufficient causal conditions for economic growth in the region.

Findings â There is a great deal of institutional diversity within the new EU member states in Central and Eastern Europe. There are no clusters of countries around a specific variety of capitalism or an economic model that has above-average economic growth rates and that is characterized by
institutions that lower the costs of market transacting. This, in turn, suggests that convergence pressures are not as great as the mainstream international-business literature has argued.

Research limitations/implications â Future research could complement this study by adopting a cross-country, comparative micro- or firm-level approach to examine the ways in which different institutional factors, both individually and collectively, shape the growth of businesses and consequently, economies.

Originality/value â Mainstream international business tends to focus on regulation and market-supporting institutions to explain growth in developing economies. This research has shown that a broader view of institutions needs to be adopted, as some countries have been able to post strong economic growth figures despite institutional environments that do not lower the costs of market-based contracting.

Home is Where The Hardship is. Gender and Wealth (Dis)Accumulation in the Subprime Boom
Subprime lending has become the penultimate case study for critics of the recent period of financialization, or neo-liberalism more broadly, because it exposes the most profligate tendencies of predatory lending and the pernicious social costs visited on society's most vulnerable groups. This article builds on the social stratification and wealth accumulation literature. We assess how mounting debt levels and crippling costs of servicing these debts compared to relatively flat income growth for female-headed households have resulted in wealth (dis)accumulation. We use the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) to analyze how single female-headed households, and in particular how African American single mothers were affected by the subprime boom in different, arguably more pernicious, ways. There is already considerable evidence showing that subprime lending was disproportionally sold to women, particularly minority women. Focusing on single mothers reveals important gender and racial dimensions of the lending techniques, but it also shows how marginalized families increasingly relied on housing wealth (equity) to adjust to shrinking purchasing power. Thus, contrary to the lofty expectations of the ownership society, the high mortgage debts of many low-income women suggest they own a lesser share of their homes – (dis)accumulation of wealth – than at any previous time.

Age-associated changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular function in middle-aged and older men are modified by weight change and lifestyle factors: longitudinal results from the European Male Ageing Study.
OBJECTIVE: Health and lifestyle factors are associated with variations in serum testosterone levels in ageing men. However, it remains unclear how age-related changes in testosterone may be attenuated by lifestyle modifications. The objective was to investigate the longitudinal relationships between changes in health and lifestyle factors with changes in hormones of the reproductive endocrine axis in ageing men. DESIGN: A longitudinal survey of 2736 community-dwelling men aged 40-79 years at baseline recruited from eight centres across Europe. Follow-up assessment occurred mean (±s.d.) 4.4±0.3 years later. RESULTS: PAIRED TESTOSTERONE RESULTS WERE AVAILABLE FOR 2395 MEN. MEAN (S.D.) ANNUALISED HORMONE CHANGES WERE AS FOLLOWS: testosterone -0.1±0.95 nmol/l; free testosterone (FT) -3.83±16.8 pmol/l; sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) 0.56±2.5 nmol/l and LH 0.08±0.57 U/l. Weight loss was associated with a proportional increase, and weight gain a proportional decrease, in testosterone and SHBG. FT showed a curvilinear relationship to weight change; only those who gained or lost ≥15% of weight showed a significant change (in the same direction as testosterone). Smoking cessation was associated with a greater decline in testosterone than being a non-smoker, which was unrelated to weight change. Changes in number of comorbid conditions or physical activity were not associated with significant alterations in hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) axis function. CONCLUSIONS: Body weight and lifestyle factors influence HPT axis function in ageing. Weight loss was associated with a rise, and weight gain a fall, in testosterone, FT and SHBG. Weight management appears to be important in maintaining circulating testosterone in ageing men, and obesity-associated changes in HPT axis hormones are reversible following weight reduction.

Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies 56 bone mineral density loci and reveals 14 loci associated with risk of fracture.
Bone mineral density (BMD) is the most widely used predictor of fracture risk. We performed the largest meta-analysis to date on lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD, including 17 genome-wide association studies and 32,961 individuals of European and east Asian ancestry. We tested the top BMD-associated markers for replication in 50,933 independent subjects and for association with risk of low-trauma fracture in 31,016 individuals with a history of fracture (cases) and 102,444 controls. We identified 56 loci (32 new) associated with BMD at genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8)). Several of these factors cluster within the RANK-RANKL-OPG, mesenchymal stem cell differentiation, endochondral ossification and Wnt signaling pathways. However, we also discovered loci that were localized to genes not known to have a role in bone biology. Fourteen BMD-associated loci were also associated with fracture risk (P < 5 × 10(-4), Bonferroni corrected), of which six reached P < 5 × 10(-8), including at 18p11.21 (FAM210A), 7q21.3 (SLC25A13), 11q13.2 (LRP5), 4q22.1 (MEPE), 2p16.2 (SPTBN1) and 10q21.1 (DKK1). These findings shed light on the genetic architecture and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying BMD variation and fracture susceptibility.

[mitochondrial, human, trh, hormone]

Thyrotropin-releasing hormone controls mitochondrial biology in human epidermis.
CONTEXT: Mitochondrial capacity and metabolic potential are under the control of hormones, such as thyroid hormones. The most proximal regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, TRH, is the key hypothalamic integrator of energy metabolism via its impact on thyroid hormone secretion. OBJECTIVE: Here, we asked whether TRH directly modulates mitochondrial functions in normal, TRH-receptor-positive human epidermis. METHODS: Organ-cultured human skin was treated with TRH (5-100 ng/ml) for 12-48 h. RESULTS: TRH significantly increased epidermal immunoreactivity for the mitochondria-selective subunit I of respiratory chain complex IV (MTCO1). This resulted from an increased MTCO1 transcription and protein synthesis and a stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis as demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy and TRH-enhanced mitochondrial DNA synthesis. TRH also significantly stimulated the transcription of several other mitochondrial key genes (TFAM, HSP60, and BMAL1), including the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1α). TRH significantly enhanced mitochondrial complex I and IV enzyme activity and enhanced the oxygen consumption of human skin samples, which shows that the stimulated mitochondria are fully vital because the main source for cellular oxygen consumption is mitochondrial endoxidation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings identify TRH as a potent, novel neuroendocrine stimulator of mitochondrial activity and biogenesis in human epidermal keratinocytes in situ. Thus, human epidermis offers an excellent model for dissecting neuroendocrine controls of human mitochondrial biology under physiologically relevant conditions and for exploring corresponding clinical applications.

[olaparib, patient, bevacizumab, combination]

Phase I study to assess the safety and tolerability of olaparib in combination with bevacizumab in patients with advanced solid tumours.
BACKGROUND: Olaparib (AZD2281) is a potent oral poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor with anti-tumour activity and acceptable toxicity as monotherapy in patients with BRCA-deficient cancers. The vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor bevacizumab has been incorporated into standard of care with chemotherapy in various tumours. This phase I study established the safety, tolerability and clinical pharmacokinetics of olaparib alone and in combination with bevacizumab. METHODS: Patients with advanced solid tumours received increasing doses of continuous oral olaparib (100, 200 and 400 mg b.i.d. capsule formulation) in combination with bevacizumab (10 mg kg(-1) intravenous q2w). RESULTS: In all, 12 patients enrolled and received treatment. The most common adverse events (AEs) related to olaparib were grade 1/2 nausea and fatigue. No haematological parameters were reported as AEs. No serious AEs related to olaparib or dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were reported. Three patients discontinued due to AEs, two patients discontinued both olaparib and bevacizumab and one patient discontinued olaparib. Five patients received combination treatment for over 6 months. There was no evidence that bevacizumab affected olaparib. CONCLUSION: The combination of olaparib 400 mg b.i.d. with bevacizumab 10 mg kg(-1) q2w was generally well tolerated with no DLTs. This combination could be considered for future clinical investigation.

Large effect of baseline treatment with long-acting antipsychotic drugs on randomised treatment outcomes Abstract. British Association for Psychopharmacology Summer Meeting, Harrogate, UK.
Introduction: In the CUtLASS 1 trial (Jones et al 2006 Arch Gen Psych 63, 1079-1087) patients with an inadequate clinical response or intolerance were randomised to either a first generation antipsychotic (FGA) drug or a (non-clozapine) second generation antipsychotic (SGA) with assessments at baseline, 12, 26 and 52 weeks following randomisation. the primary outcome was quality of life (QoL) measured using the QLS, with secondary outcome measures includingsymptoms (PANSS), depression (CDSS), overall functioning (GAF), drug attitude (DAI) and adherence (Kemp). non-neurological side effects (ANNSERS) andneurological side effects (Simpson-Angus, AIMS, Barnes) were also assessed. Would outcome during the course of the trial be affected by the delivery route of theantipsychotic drug prescribed at trial entry? Methods: Forty per cent (n=90) of the 227 patients entering the CUtLASS 1 trial were being treated with a depot FGA antipsychotic prior to randomisation. Results: Fitting multi-level mixed-effects models using stata 11 and including demographic variables and baseline attitudes to medication as predictors showed that: 1. QLS was significantly reduced (-5.7 points; CI -10.1, -1.4) at final visit in those receiving depot before randomisation. There was no significant difference in this effect between those who were randomised to first or second generation antipsychotics during the trial. 2. The same pattern of results held for PANSS total score and GAF. 3. Modelling centre as a separate level had little effect on coefficients of baseline covariates. 4. Baseline DAI score indicating adherent attitudes predicted better outcome on all three measures (p<0.001). Conclusions: Participants randomised from depot medication at baseline had a significantly worse one-year outcome regardless of subsequent allocation to FGA or SGA than those taking oral medication at baseline. this may be due to reduced adherence. Once participants were randomised into the study, adherent attitudes were predictive of outcome. The effect was present whether the patient was randomised to a first or second generation antipsychotic during the course of the trial.

What Happens in Films?
<p>This paper aims to contribute to the analysis and description of semantic video content by investigating what actions are important in films. We apply a corpus analysis method to identify frequently occurring phrases in texts that describe films - screenplays and audio description. Frequent words and statistically significant collocations of these words are identified in screenplays of 75 films and in audio description of 45 films. Phrases such as ‘looks at’, ‘turns to’, ‘smiles at’ and various collocations of ‘door’ were found to be common. We argue that these phrases occur frequently because they describe actions that are important story-telling elements for filmed narrative. We discuss how this knowledge helps the development of systems to structure semantic video content.</p>

[isotopic, nitrogen, chlorophyll, mil, sapropel, eastern, mediterranean, marine, chlorin, ratio]

Nitrogen isotopes in chlorophyll and the origin of Eastern Mediterranean sapropels
The goals of this thesis were: (1) to establish methods for the determination of
nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios in marine particulate and sedimentary
chlorophyll derivatives; (2) to establish chlorophyll δ15N and δl3C as proxies for
the nitrogen and carbon isotopic composition of marine phytoplankton; and (3)
to use chlorophyll nitrogen isotopic ratios to understand the origin of Late
Quaternary Eastern Mediterranean sapropels.
Techniques are presented for the determination of chlorin nitrogen and carbon
isotopic ratios in marine particles and sediments with a precision greater than
0.15 per mil for both isotopes. The procedure can be performed in about 4 hours
for particulate and 8 hours for sediment samples, and relies on multiple
chromatographic purifications. About 20 g of a moderately organic-rich
sediment are required.
A technique is also presented for the determination of chlorin nitrogen and
carbon isotopic ratios by isotope-ratio monitoring gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry (irmGC-MS) by synthesizing bis-(tert.-butyldimethylsiloxy)Si(IV)
chlorin derivatives. However, yields for the 4-step synthesis were only about 5-6% and there was a net isotopic depletion of 1.2 (± 0.3) per mil in the derivative,
relative to the starting material.
These techniques are then used to show that the nitrogen isotopic difference
between chlorophyll and whole cells in six species of marine phytoplankton is
5.16 ± 2.40 per mil. For carbon, the isotopic difference between chlorophyll and
whole cells in five species of marine phytoplankton is -0.02 ± 2.12 per mil. A
model of the distribution of 15N in phytoplankton is constructed and it is
demonstrated that the interspecies variability observed for the nitrogen isotopic
difference between chlorophyll and whole cells can be attributed to differences in the partitioning of cellular nitrogen between non-protein biochemicals. In the
field, where mixed assemblages of phytoplankton prevail, the isotopic difference
beween chlorophyll and whole cells is expected to tend toward the average value
of 5.16 per mil.
Finally, the average nitrogen isotopic composition of chlorins from six Late
Quaternary Eastern Mediterranean sapropels (-5.01 + 0.38 per mil) was found to
be very similar to the δ15N of chlorophyll from the modem deep chlorophyll
maximum (-6.38 ± 1.80 per mil) in the Eastern Mediterranean. In addition,
sapropel photoautotrophic material, calculated from the chlorin δ15N, had the
same isotopic composition (0.15 per mil) as both bulk sapropel sediments (-0.08 ±
0.53 per mil) and deep water nitrate (-0.05 per mil). These data suggest (a) that
bottom waters were anoxic, (b) that organic matter burial efficiency was
enhanced, and (c) that oligotrophic conditions similar to today persisted, in the
Eastern Mediterranean during sapropel deposition. These results contradict
earlier interpretations of Late Quaternary bulk sedimentary δ15N in the Eastern
Mediterranean. The latter concluded that the pattern of high δ15N values in
intercalated marl oozes and low values in sapropels was the result of decreased
nutrient utilization, and hence, increased primary production, during sapropel
events. The low δ15N of deep water nitrate in the Eastern Mediterranean
suggests a significant source of new nitrogen from biological N2-fixation.
It is suggested that attempts to reconstruct the nitrogen isotopic composition of
marine organic matter in the past by measuring the δ15N of whole sediments
may be subject to misinterpretation due to the alteration of isotopic ratios during
diagenesis. The partial oxidation of marine organic matter can result in
significant isotopic enrichment of the preserved residual. The magnitude of this
enrichment appears to be large when bottom waters are well-oxygenated, and
small when bottom waters are anoxic. Environments where large temporal
reqox changes have occurred are expected to be the most problematic for the
interpretation of bulk sedimentary δ15N. In these environments, the diagenetic
signal can be at least as large as the primary isotopic signal being sought. The
Eastern Mediterranean Sea during the Late Quaternary appears to be one such
environment.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution February 1997Funding for this work came from an Office of Naval Research Graduate

Here, we survey a wide range of strategies that control the activity of biosynthetic modules in the cell in space and time, and illustrate how these strategies can be used to design efficient cellular synthetic production systems. Re-engineered versions of secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways identified from any genomic sequence can then be inserted into these systems in a plug-and-play fashion. ?? 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

SCHOOL CHOICE-MAKING, MOTHERS’ INVOLVEMENT IN CHILDREN’S EDUCATION AND SOCIAL REPRODUCTION IN THE EDUCATION MARKET IN HONG KONG
This study examines the mechanisms of class disadvantage in educational processes in Hong Kong by focusing on mothers’ secondary school choice-making and everyday educational involvement. My study is located within the context of local neoliberal education reforms in which parents are expected to rely on their own resources to support their children’s learning and all-round development and to exercise school choice. I have drawn upon cultural capital theory and applied to the local context in order to explore how patterns of persistent class differentials in educational outcomes despite expanded educational opportunities are produced in micro-level processes in the local school market. I have also drawn on the insights of the Western literature about how ‘ethnicity’ and gender complicate class processes, and used these to address these issues in the local Hong Kong context. To achieve this, I interviewed 34 local-born and mainland Chinese immigrant mothers, with children aged 11-15, who mostly come from working class and intermediate class backgrounds. My findings about mothers’ educational practices show that class mechanisms generate disadvantage by restricting the access of more disadvantaged mothers to the ‘right’ cultural capital as stipulated by the particular ‘rules of the game’ of the local educational ‘field’. At the same time, my study sheds light on the diversity of the structural and moral contexts in which cultural capital mobilization is embedded and the myriad ways that ‘ethnicity’ and gender interact to aggravate, mitigate, or ameliorate class disadvantage. I underline the need for local researchers to spell out and problematize the institutionalization of class privilege and disadvantage within the education system. At the same time, the study makes a novel contribution to the wider literature by offering an account of class reproduction in Hong Kong which is different in important respects to that found in many other generic accounts which take as their focus advanced ‘Western’ capitalist societies. My findings also highlight the importance of examining the contextual contingency of how cultural capital ‘works’ and so stress the indeterminacy of class processes.

Loss-of-function mutations in SMARCE1 cause an inherited disorder of multiple spinal meningiomas
One-third of all primary central nervous system tumors in adults are meningiomas. Rarely, meningiomas occur at multiple sites, usually occurring in individuals with type 2 neurofibromatosis (NF2). We sequenced the exomes of three unrelated individuals with familial multiple spinal meningiomas without NF2 mutations. We identified two individuals with heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex subunit gene SMARCE1. Sequencing of SMARCE1 in six further individuals with spinal meningiomas identified two additional heterozygous loss-of-function mutations. Tumors from individuals with SMARCE1 mutations were of clear-cell histological subtype, and all had loss of SMARCE1 protein, consistent with a tumor suppressor mechanism. Our findings identify multiple-spinal-meningioma disease as a new discrete entity and establish a key role for the SWI/SNF complex in the pathogenesis of both meningiomas and tumors with clear-cell histology.

Warburg meets autophagy: cancer-associated fibroblasts accelerate tumor growth and metastasis via oxidative stress, mitophagy, and aerobic glycolysis.
SIGNIFICANCE: Here, we review certain recent advances in oxidative stress and tumor metabolism, which are related to understanding the contributions of the microenvironment in promoting tumor growth and metastasis. In the early 1920s, Otto Warburg, a Nobel Laureate, formulated a hypothesis to explain the "fundamental basis" of cancer, based on his observations that tumors displayed a metabolic shift toward glycolysis. In 1963, Christian de Duve, another Nobel Laureate, first coined the phrase auto-phagy, derived from the Greek words "auto" and "phagy," meaning "self" and "eating." RECENT ADVANCES: Now, we see that these two ideas (autophagy and aerobic glycolysis) physically converge in the tumor stroma. First, cancer cells secrete hydrogen peroxide. Then, as a consequence, oxidative stress in cancer-associated fibroblasts drives autophagy, mitophagy, and aerobic glycolysis. CRITICAL ISSUES: This "parasitic" metabolic coupling converts the stroma into a "factory" for the local production of recycled and high-energy nutrients (such as L-lactate)-to fuel oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in cancer cells. We believe that Warburg and de Duve would be pleased with this new two-compartment model for understanding tumor metabolism. It adds a novel stromal twist to two very well-established cancer paradigms: aerobic glycolysis and autophagy. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Undoubtedly, these new metabolic models will foster the development of novel biomarkers, and corresponding therapies, to achieve the goal of personalized cancer medicine. Given the central role that oxidative stress plays in this process, new powerful antioxidants should be developed in the fight against cancer.

The irritable bowel severity scoring system: a simple method of monitoring irritable bowel syndrome and its progress.
BACKGROUND: The clinical assessment and investigation of irritable bowel syndrome would be greatly facilitated by the introduction of a simple, easy to use severity scoring system. Such a system, developed in our department over a number of years, has been submitted to validation in a total of 141 patients and 40 healthy controls. METHODS: The system, incorporating pain, distension, bowel dysfunction and quality of life/global well-being, was assessed for its ability to reliably score patients previously classified as mild, moderate or severe. The reproducibility and sensitivity to change of the system was also assessed. RESULTS: The maximum achievable score was 500. Mild, moderate and severe cases were indicated by scores of 75 to 175, 175 to 300 and > 300 respectively. Controls scored below 75 and patients scoring in this range can be considered to be in remission. There was a highly significant difference between controls and patients as a whole (P = 0.0001) as well as significant differences (P < 0.01) between all severity categories. Scores repeated within 24 h were very reproducible and sensitivity to change was also extremely good (P < 0.001) with a change of 50 reliably indicating improvement. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that this scoring system should prove to be a valuable instrument in helping to meet the many challenges offered by irritable bowel syndrome.

Eliminating a region of respiratory syncytial virus attachment protein allows induction of protective immunity without vaccine-enhanced lung eosinophilia.
In a murine model of respiratory syncytial virus disease, prior sensitization to the attachment glycoprotein (G) leads to pulmonary eosinophilia and enhanced illness. Three different approaches were taken to dissect the region of G responsible for enhanced disease and protection against challenge. First, mutant viruses, containing frameshifts that altered the COOH terminus of the G protein, were used to challenge mice sensitized by scarification with recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) expressing wild-type G. Second, cDNA expressing these mutated G proteins were expressed by rVV and used to vaccinate mice before challenge with wild-type respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). These studies identified residues 193-205 to be responsible for G-induced weight loss and lung eosinophilia and showed that this region was not was not necessary for induction of protective immunity. Third, mice were sensitized using an rVV that expressed only amino acids 124-203 of the G protein. Upon RSV challenge, mice sensitized with this rVV developed enhanced weight loss and eosinophilia. This is the first time that a region within RSV (amino acids 193-203) has been shown to be responsible for induction of lung eosinophilia and disease enhancement. Moreover, we now show that it is possible to induce protective immunity with an altered G protein without inducing a pathological response.

Detection of low-abundance protein phosphorylation by selective (18)o labeling and mass spectrometry.
Reversible phosphorylation regulates the majority of intracellular networking and pathways. The study of this widely explored post-translational modification is usually challenged by low stoichiometric levels of modification. Many approaches have been developed to overcome this problem and to achieve rigorous characterization of protein phosphorylation. We describe a method for enhanced detection of low-abundance protein phosphorylation that uses selective introduction of (18)O label into phosphorylation sites with H(2)(18)O and mass spectrometric detection. The method was applied to introduce (18)O label into bacterially expressed Aurora A kinase phosphorylation sites and resulted in the representation of phosphorylated peptides as doublets or triplets according to the number of phosphate groups. A total of 28 phosphopeptides were observed by this method.

Exploring the role of prolactin in psoriasis.
Prolactin (PRL) is well recognised for its role(s) in mammary gland development and function. Moreover, its role in skin biology, including the potent regulation of human hair growth, is becoming clearer. Less widely appreciated, however, is the potential role of PRL in the pathobiology of psoriasis. While the relationship between PRL and psoriasis remains enigmatic, several recent publications on the PRL-psoriasis connection have demonstrated a reawakening of interest in this conundrum. We take the occasion of these reports to underscore the importance of dissecting the role(s) of PRL in the aetiopathology of psoriasis, not least since this may help to identify novel hormonal treatment strategies in its management.

Modelling Observation Correlations for Active Exploration and Robust Object Detection
Today, mobile robots are expected to carry out increasingly complex tasks in multifarious, real-world environments. Often, the tasks require a certain semantic understanding of the workspace. Consider, for example, spoken instructions from a human collaborator referring to objects of interest; the robot must be able to accurately detect these objects to correctly understand the instructions. However, existing object detection, while competent, is not perfect. In particular, the performance of detection algorithms is commonly sensitive to the position of the sensor relative to the objects in the scene.

This paper presents an online planning algorithm which learns an explicit model of the spatial dependence of object detection and generates plans which maximize the expected performance of the detection, and by extension the overall plan performance. Crucially, the learned sensor model incorporates spatial correlations between measurements, capturing the fact that successive measurements taken at the same or nearby locations are not independent. We show how this sensor model can be incorporated into an efficient forward search algorithm in the information space of detected objects, allowing the robot to generate motion plans efficiently. We investigate the performance of our approach by addressing the tasks of door and text detection in indoor environments and demonstrate significant improvement in detection performance during task execution over alternative methods in simulated and real robot experiments.

Matrix remodeling stimulates stromal autophagy, "fueling" cancer cell mitochondrial metabolism and metastasis.
We have previously demonstrated that loss of stromal caveolin-1 (Cav-1) in cancer-associated fibroblasts is a strong and independent predictor of poor clinical outcome in human breast cancer patients. However, the signaling mechanism(s) by which Cav-1 downregulation leads to this tumor-promoting microenvironment are not well understood. To address this issue, we performed an unbiased comparative proteomic analysis of wild-type (WT) and Cav-1(-/-) null mammary stromal fibroblasts (MSFs). Our results show that plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 and type 2 (PAI-1 and PAI-2) expression is significantly increased in Cav-1(-/-) MSFs. To establish a direct cause-effect relationship, we next generated immortalized human fibroblast lines stably overexpressing either PAI-1 or PAI-2. Importantly, PAI-1/2(+) fibroblasts promote the growth of MDA-MB-231 tumors (a human breast cancer cell line) in a murine xenograft model, without any increases in angiogenesis. Similarly, PAI-1/2(+) fibroblasts stimulate experimental metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells using an in vivo lung colonization assay. Further mechanistic studies revealed that fibroblasts overexpressing PAI-1 or PAI-2 display increased autophagy ("self-eating") and are sufficient to induce mitochondrial biogenesis/activity in adjacent cancer cells, in co-culture experiments. In xenografts, PAI-1/2(+) fibroblasts significantly reduce the apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 tumor cells. The current study provides further support for the "Autophagic Tumor Stroma Model of Cancer" and identifies a novel "extracellular matrix"-based signaling mechanism, by which a loss of stromal Cav-1 generates a metastatic phenotype. Thus, the secretion and remodeling of extracellular matrix components (such as PAI-1/2) can directly regulate both (1) autophagy in stromal fibroblasts and (2) epithelial tumor cell mitochondrial metabolism.

Steady Dark Solitary Waves Emerging from Wave-Generated Meanflow: The Role of Modulation Equations
<p>Various classes of steady and unsteady dark solitary waves (DSWs) are known to exist in modulation equations for water waves in finite depth. However, there is a class of steady DSWS of the full water-wave problem which are missed by the classical modulation equations such as the Hasimoto-Ono, Benney-Roskes, and Davey-Stewartson. These steady DSWs, recently discovered by Bridges and Donaldson, are pervasive in finite depth, arise through secondary criticality of Stokes gravity waves, and are synchronized with the Stokes wave. In this paper, the role of DSWs in modulation equations for water waves is reappraised. The intrinsic unsteady nature of existing modulation equations filters out some interesting solutions. On the other hand, the geometry of DSWs in modulation equations is very similar to the full water wave problem and these geometrical properties are developed. A model equation is proposed which illustrates the general nature of the emergence of steady DSWs due to wave-generated mean flow coupled to a periodic wave. Although the existing modulation equations are intrinsically unsteady, it is shown that there are also important shortcomings when one wants to use them for stability analysis of DSWs.</p>

Online Prediction of the Post-Disturbance Frequency Behaviour of a Power System
The radical changes that are currently occurring in the nature of power systems means that in the future it may no longer be possible to guarantee security of supply using offline security assessment and planning. The increased uncertainty, particularly the reduction and variation in system inertia that will be faced in the future must be overcome through the use of adaptive online solutions for ensuring system security. The introduction of synchronised measurement technology means that the wide area real time measurements that are necessary to implement these online actions are now available.The objective of the research presented in this thesis was to create methods for predicting the post-disturbance frequency behaviour of a power system with the intent of contributing to the development of real time adaptive corrective control for future power systems. Such a prediction method would generate an online prediction based on wide area measurements of frequency and active power that are recorded within the period of approximately one second after a disturbance to the active power balance of the system. Predictions would allow frequency control to respond more quickly and efficiently as it would no longer be necessary to wait for the system frequency behaviour to violate pre-determined thresholds.The research presented in this thesis includes the creation of an online method for the simultaneous detection of the time at which a disturbance occurred in a power system, or area of a power system, and the estimation of the inertia of that system, or area. An existing prediction method based on approximate models has been redesigned to eliminate its dependence on offline information. Furthermore, the thesis presents the novel application of pattern classification theory to frequency prediction and a five class example of pattern classification is implemented.

"European Union Citizenship: The Long Road to Inclusion"
AbstractThe University of ManchesterJulia Elena BradshawDoctor of Laws (LLD)European Union Citizenship: The Long Road to Inclusion2012	This thesis considers the development of the concept of citizenship, both historically and in its supranational guise. It addresses the traditional models of citizenship that have arisen in the national arena before turning its focus to supranational citizenship.	The development of quasi-citizenship rights at the European level between 1957 and 1992 are discussed whilst asking whether, in fact, these principles amounted to a de facto creation of citizenship as would be formally understood in a national model. Thereafter, post-1992 developments are considered via the activities of the European courts. The courts’ particularly activist role in expanding our understanding of Union citizenship by using existing Union legislation in imaginative ways is highlighted and used as a key factor in determining Union citizenship’s capacity to adapt and develop in the face of new challenges.	This thesis plays particular attention to the non-Member State nationals who reside in Union territory and find themselves ostensibly deprived of citizenship rights despite being actively involve in the Union’s activities. Supranational citizenship is viewed through the unusual lens of stateless persons and this thesis suggests that Union citizenship does not live up to its ideals by excluding them from its understanding of the citizenry. It formulates a novel conception of rights-based residence, as opposed to nationality-based, supranational citizenship that is predicated on the Union’s heritage of respect for rights and would include Member State nationals, alongside third-country nationals, the stateless and refugees (who would struggle to gain recognition under a conventional citizenship paradigm), with the aspiration of rendering Union citizenship a more inclusive and rounded conception.

Bio-bleaching of Dyed Cotton Fabric Using a Bacterial Catalyst
Anaerobically grown cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 were able to bio-bleach the color from cotton fabric that was dyed with Remazol Black B (C. I. Reactive Black 5), a common diazo reactive dye. This bio-bleaching process, involving a bacterial catalyst, offers potential benefits to the color industry as the removal of color from dyed fabric opens up the potential for fabric re-use. Growing cells removed the color with greater efficiency than that achieved using pre-grown ``resting{''} cells. Assays of resting cells were used to determine the effect of cell concentration and depth of shade of the dyeing on the color removal process. Further resting cell assays were carried out to ascertain if an electron donor was required for the color removal process, and suggested that the cotton substrate could supply some reducing power to the biocatalyst, although dye reduction rates were maximal with added electron donor (formate). The Shewanella cells were also able to remove the color from dyed cotton fabric that was isolated inside a dialysis membrane to prevent contact with the cells. This indicates that Shewanella strain J18 143 is able to synthesize and excrete endogenous extracellular electron shuttles, eliminating the need for direct contact between the intracellular electron transport components and the extracellular terminal electron acceptors. The dyed cotton fabric was assessed visually, and by reflectance spectroscopy and environmental scanning electron microscopy.

What is the importance of the immunological synapse?
The immunological synapse (IS) has proved to be a stimulating concept, particularly in provoking discussion on the similarity of intercellular communication controlling disparate biological processes. Recent studies have clarified some of the underlying molecular mechanisms and functions of the IS. For both T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, assembly of the IS can be described in stages with distinct cytoskeletal requirements. Functions of the IS vary with circumstance and include directing secretion and integrating positive and negative signals to determine the extent of response.

How are doctoral students supervised? Concepts of doctoral research supervision.
<p>Literature about doctoral supervision has concentrated on describing the ever lengthening lists of functions that must be carried out. This functional approach is necessary but there has been little exploration of a different paradigm, a conceptual approach towards research supervision. This paper, based on interviews with supervisors from a range of disciplines, aims to fill this a gap. The main concepts identified are: Functional: where the issue is one of project management; enculturation: where the student is encouraged to become a member of the disciplinary community; critical thinking: where the student is encouraged to question and analyse their work; emancipation: where the student is encouraged to question and develop themselves; and developing a quality relationship: where the student is enthused, inspired and cared for. Supervisors of doctoral students are also trying to reconcile the tensions between their professional role as an academic and their personal self as well as encouraging students to move a long a path towards increasing independence. The concepts are examined in the light of each of these tensions. Finally the research illuminates the power of the supervisor’s own experience as a student and the paper suggests that supervisors need to be aware of both the positive and negative aspects of each of these conceptual approaches.</p>

INTEGRATING INDIGENOUS SKILLS AS PANACEA FOR IMPROVING VOCATIONAL AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN NIGERIA
The paper focused on the need to integrate indigenous skills as panacea for improving Vocational and Technical Education (VTE) in secondary schools in Nigeria. The purposive population was used which comprises of teachers, students and artisans. A random sampling technique was used to select 200 respondents for the study. Descriptive survey research design was used for the study. A twenty- item questionnaire was used to elicit responses from the respondents. Standard deviation and means scores were used to analyze the data. The result shows that the integration of indigenous skills in the teaching and learning of Vocational and Technical Education will improve the quality of skills acquired in schools to a greater extent. The level of acceptability of the infusion of indigenous skills by the stakeholders is very high in the area of exposing students of VTE to practical skills and collaborative efforts. Based on the results of the study, it is recommended among others that Government should provide enabling environment for the integration of indigenous skills for improving vocational and technical education in secondary schools in Nigeria. &nbsp; KEYWORDS: Indigenous skills, Vocational and Technical Education, Collaborative efforts and Enabling Environment.

Early detection and intervention evaluation for people at risk of psychosis: multisite randomised controlled trial.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cognitive therapy is effective in preventing the worsening of emerging psychotic symptoms experienced by help seeking young people deemed to be at risk for serious conditions such as schizophrenia. DESIGN: Multisite single blind randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Diverse services at five UK sites. PARTICIPANTS: 288 participants aged 14-35 years (mean 20.74, SD 4.34 years) at high risk of psychosis: 144 were assigned to cognitive therapy plus monitoring of mental state and 144 to monitoring of mental state only. Participants were followed-up for a minimum of 12 months and a maximum of 24 months. INTERVENTION: Cognitive therapy (up to 26 (mean 9.1) sessions over six months) plus monitoring of mental state compared with monitoring of mental state only. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was scores on the comprehensive assessment of at risk mental states (CAARMS), which provides a dichotomous transition to psychosis score and ordinal scores for severity of psychotic symptoms and distress. Secondary outcomes included emotional dysfunction and quality of life. RESULTS: Transition to psychosis based on intention to treat was analysed using discrete time survival models. Overall, the prevalence of transition was lower than expected (23/288; 8%), with no significant difference between the two groups (proportional odds ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.32 to 1.68). Changes in severity of symptoms and distress, as well as secondary outcomes, were analysed using random effects regression (analysis of covariance) adjusted for site and baseline symptoms. Distress from psychotic symptoms did not differ (estimated difference at 12 months -3.00, 95% confidence interval -6.95 to 0.94) but their severity was significantly reduced in the group assigned to cognitive therapy (estimated between group effect size at 12 months -3.67, -6.71 to -0.64, P=0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive therapy plus monitoring did not significantly reduce transition to psychosis or symptom related distress but reduced the severity of psychotic symptoms in young people at high risk. Most participants in both groups improved over time. The results have important implications for the at risk mental state concept. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN56283883.

pH-responsive, redox-sensitive hollow particles for the repair of load-bearing soft tissue
This thesis presents an investigation of pH-responsive, redox-sensitive poly(MMA-co- MAA) and poly(EA-co-MAA) hollow particles for the repair of load-bearing soft tissues, such as articular cartilage and the intervertebral disc.	Hollow particles continue to attract major interest due to their numerous potential applications. The new method for hollow particle preparation presented in this thesis does not require the use of a colloidal template and is well suited for scaling up. Hollow particles were formed using linear poly(MMA-co-MAA) and poly(EA-co-MAA) aliphatic copolymers synthesised using free-radical chain copolymerisation performed in solution. These copolymers were dissolved in dichloromethane using methanol as a cosolvent and emulsified in water. Diffusion of the methanol into the aqueous phase prompts precipitation of the copolymer at the droplet/water interface. The more hydrophobic copolymers containing less MAA showed improved morphology compared to copolymers containing more MAA. Also, poly(EA-co-MAA) hollow particles had a more spherical morphology than poly(MMA-co-MAA) hollow particles with equivalent MAA contents. This was attributed to the lower Tg of the EA structural monomer, which resulted in more flexible particle shells.	Unusually, during potentiometric titration of uncrosslinked hollow particles, the pH of the system decreased with increasing neutralisation. This behaviour is thought to be due to the unfolding of copolymer chains, exposing shielded carboxyl groups. The random structure of the copolymers is believed to be necessary for this behaviour. Crosslinked particles became swollen when the pH was increased using buffers. Concentrated dispersions formed self supporting gels, due to steric confinement, at 5 wt.%. The crosslinking process was performed by functionalising with cystamine using carbodiimide chemistry. This introduced disulphide crosslinks; which could be cleaved under reducing conditions at high pH, dissolving the gels. This ability to reduce the hollow particle shells to their constituent linear copolymer chains gives potential for natural removal from the body via extraction by the renal system. pH-triggered loading and release of a hydrophilic dye using crosslinked hollow particles was demonstrated. The similarity of the particle formation process to traditional solvent evaporation also allowed the loading of a hydrophobic dye. However, these particles were not crosslinked so release following swelling could not be investigated.	Cystamine-crosslinked systems suffered from degradation due to thiol-disulphide exchange at high pH (~ pH 8). Crosslinking of one system was performed using 2-amino ethyl methacrylate (AEM). This introduced covalent, vinyl intra-shell crosslinking; which did not break down at high pH. Additional AEM was also used to allow inter-particle UVcrosslinking to form doubly crosslinked (DX) hollow-particle hydrogels. These gels did not re-disperse in buffer. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a covalent hydrogel formed from pH-responsive hollow particles. The DX gels offer improved mechanical properties compared to the singly crosslinked, physical gels.	Freeze-dried samples of all of the gels produced during this study showed highly porous structures when observed using SEM. The rapid diffusion of FITC-dextran through a sample of DX gel indicates that these pores were interconnected. This is beneficial as it encourages tissue ingrowth, in addition to allowing the rapid diffusion of nutrients, oxygen and cell waste in vivo.

Large-scale genome-wide association analysis of bipolar disorder identifies a new susceptibility locus near ODZ4.
We conducted a combined genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 7,481 individuals with bipolar disorder (cases) and 9,250 controls as part of the Psychiatric GWAS Consortium. Our replication study tested 34 SNPs in 4,496 independent cases with bipolar disorder and 42,422 independent controls and found that 18 of 34 SNPs had P < 0.05, with 31 of 34 SNPs having signals with the same direction of effect (P = 3.8 × 10(-7)). An analysis of all 11,974 bipolar disorder cases and 51,792 controls confirmed genome-wide significant evidence of association for CACNA1C and identified a new intronic variant in ODZ4. We identified a pathway comprised of subunits of calcium channels enriched in bipolar disorder association intervals. Finally, a combined GWAS analysis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder yielded strong association evidence for SNPs in CACNA1C and in the region of NEK4-ITIH1-ITIH3-ITIH4. Our replication results imply that increasing sample sizes in bipolar disorder will confirm many additional loci.

[force, response, fibroblast, dupuytren, generation, contraction, cell, mechanical]

Transforming growth factor-beta1 stimulation enhances Dupuytren's fibroblast contraction in response to uniaxial mechanical load within a 3-dimensional collagen gel.
PURPOSE: A function of fibroblasts is the generation of cytomechanical force within their surrounding extracellular matrix. Abnormalities in force generation may be the cause of many pathologic conditions including scarring, and some fibroproliferative disorders such as Dupuytren's disease, which is the focus of this report. METHODS: This work investigated the cytomechanical responses of Dupuytren's-derived fibroblasts to externally applied mechanical force using a culture force monitor model, with and without stimulation with the fibrosis-linked cytokine, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). We compared these responses with cytomechanical responses of fibroblasts derived from the transverse carpal ligament. RESULTS: Dupuytren's fibroblasts display a significantly greater ability to contract a collagen matrix compared with control fibroblasts, with a maximum generated force of 131 dynes (p < .001). These cells did not exhibit a characteristic plateau phase in the contraction, which indicates a delay in achieving tensional homeostasis from Dupuytren's-derived cells. After being subjected to uniaxial overload and underload, Dupuytren's fibroblasts responded by increased force generation, whereas control fibroblasts responded by a reduction in force in response to an overload, and contraction in response to an underload. These changes were exacerbated by the addition of the profibrotic factor TGF-beta1, with a significant increase in generated force for all cell types, in particular during the early phase of fibroblast attachment and contraction, and a positive contraction gradient in response to overloading forces. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that cells derived from this fibrotic disease display characteristic abnormalities in force generation profiles. Their default response to loading or underloading is contraction, or increased force generation. This work highlights the role of TGF-beta1 as a mechano-transduction cytokine, which has an influence on the early phase cell of force generation, as well as a role in mechanical responses of cells to external mechanical stimuli. This, in turn, may influence the progression of Dupuytren's disease and the high rates of recurrence seen postoperatively.

Distinct memory profiles in Alzheimer's disease.
Memory impairment is a prominent defining feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet the degree to which the profile of memory impairment is uniform across patients is not fully resolved. The study examined patterns of memory impairment in a large cohort of AD patients, with particular attention to the relationship between working and long-term declarative memory. Tests of working memory, visual and verbal recall and recognition, and recent personal memory were administered to 67 AD patients in the early to moderate stages of disease and to 30 age-matched controls. Performance on all measures was significantly poorer in patients than in controls. Factor analysis of test scores delineated five factors representing the domains of working memory, visual recall, verbal recall, recognition, and personal memory, indicating that these aspects of memory can break down separately. Cluster analysis revealed distinct memory profiles. Some patients showed predominant problems in working memory, with relatively superior long term retention, whereas other patients showed the reverse pattern. Qualitatively distinct profiles arose at comparable levels of severity. Problems in working memory, but not long term memory were associated with the presence of language and perceptuospatial deficits. The results reinforce previous findings that both working and long term memory failure contribute to the memory symptoms of AD patients, and demonstrate dissociations in memory breakdown across the cohort. The link between working memory and language performance, together with findings of posterior hemisphere abnormalities on neuroimaging, lead us to reassess the nature of working memory deficits in AD.

Observations on viscosity reduction of PHPA polymer support fluids
Polymer fluids have been used in foundation drilling for many years and yet no previous studies have been reported which assess their sensitivity to shear such as is induced by pumping equipment. A field study has been carried out on two specific polymer products under actual site conditions. It is found that there is a significant loss of viscosity when partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (PHPA) fluids are circulated through a centrifugal pump in a loop system. This behavior is quite distinct from that of bentonite slurries which require high shear mixing and recirculation to ensure good hydration. At first sight the sensitivity of PHPA fluids to shear may be perceived as a disadvantage but in fact if shear can be reduced so can on-site energy consumption. A reduction in fluid viscosity was also observed over a standing period between mixing and use, suggesting that a second mechanism may be contributing to the properties change. From the trial results, recommendations are given on pump selection and on the maintenance of fluid properties.

Assessment of circulating biomarkers for potential pharmacodynamic utility in patients with lymphoma
PURPOSE:

Treatment efficacy and toxicity are difficult to predict in lymphoma patients. In this study, the utility of circulating biomarkers in predicting and/or monitoring treatment efficacy/toxicity were investigated.
PATIENTS AND METHODS:

Circulating biomarkers of cell death (nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) and cytokeratin 18 (CK18)), and circulating FLT3 ligand, a potential biomarker of myelosuppression, were assessed before and serially after standard chemotherapy in 49 patients with Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Cytokeratin 18 is not expressed in lymphoma cells so is a potential biomarker of epithelial toxicity in this setting. Tumour response was assessed before and after completion of chemotherapy by 2D and 3D computed tomography radiological response.
RESULTS:

Baseline nDNA level was significantly higher in all lymphoma subtypes compared with 61 healthy controls and was prognostic for progression-free survival in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Decreases in nDNA levels were observed in the first week after chemotherapy; in FL, early falls in nDNA predicted for long remission following therapy. In DLBCL, elevations in nDNA occurred in cases with progressive disease. Circulating CK18 increased within 48 h of chemotherapy and was significantly higher in patients experiencing epithelial toxicity graded >3 by Common Terminology for Classification of Adverse Events criteria. FLT3 ligand was elevated within 3-8 days of chemotherapy initiation and predicted those patients who subsequently developed neutropenic sepsis.
CONCLUSION:

These data suggest circulating biomarkers contribute useful information regarding tumour response and toxicity in patients receiving standard chemotherapy and have potential utility in the development of individualised treatment approaches in lymphoma. These biomarkers are now being tested within multicentre phase III trials to progress their qualification.

Predictive validity of within-grade scoring of longitudinal changes of MRI-based cartilage morphology and bone marrow lesion assessment in the tibio-femoral joint - the MOST study.
OBJECTIVE: In order to increase sensitivity to detect longitudinal change, recording of within-grade changes was introduced for cartilage morphology and bone marrow lesion (BML) assessment in semiquantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scoring of knee osteoarthritis (OA). The aim of this study was to examine the validity provided by within-grade scoring. DESIGN: The Multicenter Osteoarthritis (MOST) study is a longitudinal study of subjects with or at risk of knee OA. Baseline and 30 months MRIs were read according to the modified Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score (WORMS) system including within-grade changes for cartilage and BMLs. We tested the validity of within-grade changes by whether the 30-month changes in cartilage and BML assessment were predicted by baseline ipsi-compartmental meniscal damage and malalignment, factors known to affect cartilage loss and BMLs, using ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: 1867 Knees (from 1411 participants) were included. Severe medial meniscal damage predicted partial grade (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 4.4, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 2.2, 8.7) but not ≥full grade (aOR 1.3, 95% CI 0.8, 2.2) worsening of cartilage loss and predicted both, partial grade (aOR 9.6, 95% CI 3.6, 25.1) and ≥full grade (aOR 5.1, 95% CI 3.2, 8.2) worsening of BMLs. Severe, but not moderate, malalignment predicted ipsi-compartmental within-grade (medial cartilage damage: aOR 5.5, 95% CI 2.6, 11.6; medial worsening of BMLs: aOR 4.9, 95% CI 2.0, 12.3) but not full grade worsening of BMLs and cartilage damage. CONCLUSIONS: Within-grade changes in semiquantitative MRI assessment of cartilage and BMLs are valid and their use may increase the sensitivity of semiquantitative readings in detecting longitudinal changes in these structures.

Predicted giant magnetic moment on non-{n0m} surfaces of d-wave superconductors
It has been noted that the sizable areal density of midgap states which must exist on any non-{n0m} surface of a d-wave superconductor can lead to a giant magnetic moment. Here we show that this effect is observable, and discuss two precise ways to observe it: (i) by directly measuring magnetic moment in a system with a large density of internal {110} surfaces, or (ii) by performing spin-polarized tunneling on a {110} surface. In both cases, a sufficiently large magnetic field should be applied in the 1 (1) over bar 0 direction. Observing these predictions in high-T(c) superconductors can provide a strong confirmation of the d-wave scenario for such materials. S0163-1829(99)50942-9.

Treatment of peri-implantitis: what interventions are effective? A Cochrane systematic review.
PURPOSE: To identify the most effective interventions for treating peri-implantitis around osseointe-grated oral implants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched up to the 9th of June 2011 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing agents or interventions for treating peri-implantitis around oral implants. Primary outcome measures were implant failure, radiographic marginal bone level change, complications and side effects, and recurrence of peri-implantitis. Screening of eligible studies, assessment of the methodological quality of the trials and data extraction were conducted in duplicate and independently by two review authors. The statistical unit was the patient and not the implant unless the clustering of the implants within the patients had been taken into account. Results were expressed as random-effects models using mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Fifteen eligible trials were identified, but six were excluded. The following interventions were compared in the nine included studies: different non-surgical interventions (five trials), adjunctive treatments to non-surgical interventions (one trial), and different surgical interventions (two trials) and adjunctive treatments to surgical interventions (one trial). Follow-up ranged from 3 months to 4 years. No study was judged to be at low risk of bias. Statistically significant differences were observed in two small single trials judged to be at unclear or high risk of bias. After 4 months, adjunctive local antibiotics to manual debridement in patients who lost at least 50% of the bone around implants showed improved mean probing attachment levels (PAL) of 0.61 mm (95% CI 0.40 to 0.82) and reduced probing pockets depths (PPD) of 0.59 mm (95% CI 0.39 to 0.79). After 4 years, patients with periimplant infrabony defects >3 mm treated with Bio-Oss and resorbable barriers showed an improvement of 1.4 mm for PAL (95% CI 0.24 to 2.56) and PPD (95% CI 0.81 to 1.99) compared to patients treated with a nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite. CONCLUSIONS: There is no reliable evidence suggesting which could be the most effective interventions for treating peri-implantitis. This is not to say that currently used interventions are not effective. A single small trial at unclear risk of bias showed that the use of local antibiotics in addition to manual subgingival debridement was associated with a 0.6 mm additional improvement in PAL and PPD over a 4-month period in patients affected by severe forms of peri-implantitis. Another small single trial at high risk of bias showed that after 4 years, improved PAL and PPD of about 1.4 mm were obtained when using Bio-Oss with resorbable barriers compared to a nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite in peri-implant infrabony defects. There is no evidence from four trials that the more complex and expensive therapies were more beneficial than the control therapies, which basically consisted of simple subgingival mechanical debridement. Follow-up longer than 1 year suggested recurrence of peri-implantitis in up to 100% of the treated cases for some of the tested interventions. As this can be a chronic disease, re-treatment may be necessary. Larger well-designed RCTs with follow-ups longer than 1 year are needed.

Synthesis and characterization of Cr-B-N coatings deposited by reactive arc evaporation
<p>Nanocomposite Cr-B-N coatings were deposited from CrB0.2 Compound reactive arc evaporation using an Ar/N-2 discharge at 500 degrees C and -20 V substrate bias. Elastic recoil detection (ERDA), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). x-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) were used to study the effect of the N-2 partial pressure on composition and microstructure of the coatings. Cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the coating morphology changes from a glassy to a columnar structure with increasing N-2 partial pressure. which coincides with the transition from an amorphous to a crystalline growth mode. The saturation of N content in the coating confirms the formation of a thermodynamically stable CrN-BN dual-phase structure at higher N-2 fractions, exhibiting a maximum In hardness of approximately 29 GPa.</p>

Syncytin 1 in the human placenta.
This study characterises HERV-W (syncytin 1) expression in normal and pathologic placenta and in BeWo cells. HERV-W mRNA levels were higher in the first trimester than at term, and similar patterns were observed with another retrovirally-derived mRNA species, ERV-3. N-glycosylated syncytin 1 precursor (73 kDa) is cleaved to surface-associated (SU) and transmembrane (TM) subunits. Both were evident in villous trophoblast, where perinuclear and punctate cytoplasmic deposits were observed, and linear TM subunit immunoreactivity was seen at the syncytial microvillous membrane. Punctate immunoreactivity was seen in BeWo cells with antibodies to SU and TM, and the two were co-localised. SU immunoreactivity was observed in association with fetal endothelium, and this effect was increased in tissue from pre-eclamptic placentas, which also showed a higher level of total SU protein. Absence of the TM subunit from endothelium suggests it is not a biosynthetic source. We suggest that SU is released from trophoblast into fetal circulation where it may bind vascular endothelium.

Demonstrating the qualitative differences between semantic aphasia and semantic dementia: a novel exploration of nonverbal semantic processing
Semantic dementia (SD) implicates the anterior temporal lobes (ATL) as a critical substrate for semantic memory. Multi-modal semantic impairment can also be a feature of post-stroke aphasia (referred to here as “semantic aphasia” or SA)wherepatients show impaired regulatory control accompanied by lesions to the frontal and/or temporo-parietal cortices, and thus the two patient groups demonstrate qualitatively different patterns of semantic impairment 1. Previous comparisons of these two patient groups have tended to focus on verbal receptive tasks. Accordingly, this study investigated nonverbal receptive abilities via a comparison of reality decision judgements in SD and SA. Pictures of objects were presented alongside non-real distracters whose features were altered to make them more/less plausible for the semantic category. The results highlighted a number of critical differences between the two groups. Compared to SD patients, SA patients: (1) were relatively unimpaired on the two alternative forced choice (2AFC) decisions despite showing a comparable degree of semantic impairment on other assessments; (2) showed minimal effects of the plausibility manipulation; (3) were strongly influenced by variations in the regulatory requirements of tasks; and (4) exhibited a reversed effect of familiarity – i.e., better performance on less commonly encountered items. These results support a distinction between semantic impairments which arise from impaired regulatory processes (e.g., SA) versus those where degraded semantic knowledge is the causal factor (e.g., SD). SA patients performed relatively well because the task structure reduced the requirement for internally generated control. In contrast, SD patients performed poorly because their degraded knowledge did not allow the fine-grained distinctions required to complete the task.

FAST: Towards safe and effective subcutaneous immunotherapy of persistent life-threatening food allergies.
ABSTRACT: The FAST project (Food Allergy Specific Immunotherapy) aims at the development of safe and effective treatment of food allergies, targeting prevalent, persistent and severe allergy to fish and peach. Classical allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT), using subcutaneous injections with aqueous food extracts may be effective but has proven to be accompanied by too many anaphylactic side-effects. FAST aims to develop a safe alternative by replacing food extracts with hypoallergenic recombinant major allergens as the active ingredients of SIT. Both severe fish and peach allergy are caused by a single major allergen, parvalbumin (Cyp c 1) and lipid transfer protein (Pru p 3), respectively. Two approaches are being evaluated for achieving hypoallergenicity, i.e. site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification. The most promising hypoallergens will be produced under GMP conditions. After pre-clinical testing (toxicology testing and efficacy in mouse models), SCIT with alum-absorbed hypoallergens will be evaluated in phase I/IIa and IIb randomized double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) clinical trials, with the DBPC food challenge as primary read-out. To understand the underlying immune mechanisms in depth serological and cellular immune analyses will be performed, allowing identification of novel biomarkers for monitoring treatment efficacy. FAST aims at improving the quality of life of food allergic patients by providing a safe and effective treatment that will significantly lower their threshold for fish or peach intake, thereby decreasing their anxiety and dependence on rescue medication.

[lung, immune, inflammatory]

Manipulation of acute inflammatory lung disease.
Inflammatory lung disease to innocuous antigens or infectious pathogens is a common occurrence and in some cases, life threatening. Often, the inflammatory infiltrate that accompanies these events contributes to pathology by deleterious effects on otherwise healthy tissue and by compromising lung function by consolidating (blocking) the airspaces. A fine balance, therefore, exists between a lung immune response and immune-mediated damage, and in some the "threshold of ignorance" may be set too low. In most cases, the contributing, potentially offending, cell population or immune pathway is known, as are factors that regulate them. Why then are targeted therapeutic strategies to manipulate them not more commonplace in clinical medicine? This review highlights immune homeostasis in the lung, how and why this is lost during acute lung infection, and strategies showing promise as future immune therapeutics.

Ca2+ signalling in cardiovascular disease: the role of the plasma membrane calcium pumps.
The plasma membrane calcium ATPases (PMCA) are a family of genes which extrude Ca(2+) from the cell and are involved in the maintenance of intracellular free calcium levels and/or with Ca(2+) signalling, depending on the cell type. In the cardiovascular system, Ca(2+) is not only essential for contraction and relaxation but also has a vital role as a second messenger in signal transduction pathways. A complex array of mechanisms regulate intracellular free calcium levels in the heart and vasculature and a failure in these systems to maintain normal Ca(2+) homeostasis has been linked to both heart failure and hypertension. This article focuses on the functions of PMCA, in particular isoform 4 (PMCA4), in the heart and vasculature and the reported links between PMCAs and contractile function, cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac rhythm and sudden cardiac death, and blood pressure control and hypertension. It is becoming clear that this family of calcium extrusion pumps have essential roles in both cardiovascular health and disease.

Condor-COPASI: high-throughput computing for biochemical networks.
ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Mathematical modelling has become a standard technique to improve our understanding of complex biological systems. As models become larger and more complex, simulations and analyses require increasing amounts of computational power. Clusters of computers in a high-throughput computing environment can help to provide the resources required for computationally expensive model analysis. However, exploiting such a system can be difficult for users without the necessary expertise. RESULTS: We present Condor-COPASI, a server-based software tool that integrates COPASI, a biological pathway simulation tool, with Condor, a high-throughput computing environment. Condor-COPASI provides a web-based interface, which makes it extremely easy for a user to run a number of model simulation and analysis tasks in parallel. Tasks are transparently split into smaller parts, and and submitted for execution on a Condor pool. Result output is presented to the user in a number of formats, including tables and interactive graphical displays. CONCLUSIONS: Condor-COPASI can effectively use a Condor high-throughput computing environment to provide significant gains in performance for a number of model simulation and analysis tasks. Condor-COPASI is free, open source software, released under the Artistic License 2.0, and is suitable for use by any institution with access to a Condor pool.

[tissue, cell, macrophage, inflammation, il-4, blood, inflammatory, recruitment, accumulation, proliferation]

Local macrophage proliferation, rather than recruitment from the blood, is a signature of TH2 inflammation
A defining feature of inflammation is the accumulation of innate immune cells in the tissue that are thought to be recruited from the blood. We reveal that a distinct process exists in which tissue macrophages undergo rapid in situ proliferation in order to increase population density. This inflammatory mechanism occurred during T helper 2 (T(H)2)-related pathologies under the control of the archetypal T(H)2 cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) and was a fundamental component of T(H)2 inflammation because exogenous IL-4 was sufficient to drive accumulation of tissue macrophages through self-renewal. Thus, expansion of innate cells necessary for pathogen control or wound repair can occur without recruitment of potentially tissue-destructive inflammatory cells.

Power-efficient simulation of detailed cortical microcircuits on SpiNNaker
Computer simulation of neural matter is a promising methodology for understanding the function of the brain. Recent anatomical studies have mapped the intricate structure of cortex, and these data have been exploited in numerous simulations attempting to explain its function. However, the largest of these models run inconveniently slowly and require vast amounts of electrical power, which hinders useful experimentation. SpiNNaker is a novel computer architecture designed to address these problems using low-power microprocessors and custom communication hardware. We use four SpiNNaker chips (of a planned fifty thousand) to simulate, in real-time, a cortical circuit of ten thousand spiking neurons and four million synapses. In this simulation, the hardware consumes 100 nJ per neuron per millisecond and 43 nJ per postsynaptic potential, which is the smallest quantity reported for any digital computer. We argue that this approaches fast, power-feasible and scientifically useful simulations of large cortical areas.

TLR signaling in mast cells: common and unique features.
In addition to the well known role of mast cells in immunity to multi-cellular parasites and in the pathogenesis of allergy and asthma, the importance of mast cells in the immune defense against bacteria and viruses is increasingly being recognized. Their location in the skin, gut, and airways puts mast cells in an ideal location to encounter and respond to pathogens, and in order to perform this function, these cells express a variety of pattern recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Mast cells respond to TLR ligands by secreting cytokines, chemokines, and lipid mediators, and some studies have found that TLR ligands can also cause degranulation, although this finding is contentious. In addition, stimulation via TLR ligands can synergize with signaling via the FcεRI, potentially enhancing the response of the cells to antigen in vivo. A great deal is now known about TLR signaling pathways. Some features of these pathways are cell type-specific, however, and work is under way to fully elucidate the TLR signaling cascades in the mast cell. Already, some interesting differences have been identified. This review aims to address what is known about the responses of mast cells to TLR ligands and the signaling pathways involved. Given the location of mast cells at sites exposed to the environment, the response of these cells to TLR ligands must be carefully regulated. The known mechanisms behind this regulation are also reviewed here.

[ige, protein, response, lactoferrin, igg, novel, form, glycosylation, recombinant, molecule]

Influence of protein expression system on elicitation of IgE antibody responses: experience with lactoferrin.
With increased interest in genetically modified (GM) crop plants there is an important need to understand the properties that contribute to the ability of such novel proteins to provoke immune and/or allergic responses. One characteristic that may be relevant is glycosylation, particularly as novel expression systems (e.g. bacterial to plant) will impact on the protein glycoprofile. The allergenicity (IgE inducing) and immunogenicity (IgG inducing) properties of wild type native human lactoferrin (NLF) from human milk (hm) and neutrophil granules (n) and a recombinant molecule produced in rice (RLF) have been assessed. These forms of lactoferrin have identical amino acid sequences, but different glycosylation patterns: hmNLF and nNLF have complex glycoprofiles including Lewis (Le)(x) structures, with particularly high levels of Le(x) expressed by nNLF, whereas RLF is simpler and rich in mannose residues. Antibody responses induced in BALB/c strain mice by intraperitoneal exposure to the different forms of lactoferrin were characterised. Immunisation with both forms of NLF stimulated substantial IgG and IgE antibody responses. In contrast, the recombinant molecule was considerably less immunogenic and failed to stimulate detectable IgE, irrespective of endotoxin and iron content. The glycans did not contribute to epitope formation, with equivalent IgE and IgG binding recorded for high titre anti-NLF antisera regardless of whether the immunising NLF or the recombinant molecule were used substrates in the analyses. These data demonstrate that differential glycosylation profiles can have a profound impact on protein allergenicity and immunogenicity, with mannose and Le(x) exhibiting opposing effects. These results have clear relevance for characterising the allergenic hazards of novel proteins in GM crops.

Exploring ankylosing spondylitis-associated ERAP1, IL23R and IL12B gene polymorphisms in subphenotypes of psoriatic arthritis.
Objective. To ascertain whether AS-associated polymorphisms of ERAP1, IL23R and IL12B genes associate with subphenotypes of PsA, particularly axial radiographic disease once stratified by HLA-B27 and HLA-Cw*0602 status.Methods. rs30187 (ERAP1 gene), rs6887695 (IL12B gene), rs11209026 and rs7530511 (IL23R gene) single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped in 263 PsA cases from a prospective cohort and compared with data from healthy controls (n = 3266-5422). ERAP1 results were stratified according to HLA-B27 and HLA-Cw*0602 status. Investigation of association with age at onset of psoriasis/PsA, arthritic joint count, axial radiographic disease, peripheral radiographic erosions, Psoriasis Area Severity Index, nail score and HAQ was made.Results. There was a strong association between rs6887595 (IL12B) and PsA, with homozygosity for the major allele being more frequent in PsA than controls (odds ratio 1.70; 95% CI 1.3, 2.2; P < 0.001). A trend was demonstrated for the minor allele of rs11209026 (IL23R) to be less frequent in patients with erosive joint disease than in those without erosions or controls (7%, 14% and 12%, respectively). None of the polymorphisms associated with the presence of axial radiographic disease or other clinical parameters.Conclusion. We have confirmed a strong association between rs6887595 (IL12B) and PsA. A trend has been demonstrated between an IL23R variant and peripheral erosive disease. ERAP1 was not associated with axial radiographic disease in PsA. Spinal involvement in PsA may be genetically different from that in AS, which is in keeping with previous observations that the clinical and radiographic pattern of axial disease also differs.

Discovery Of A 552 Hz Burst Oscillation In The Low-Mass X-Ray Binary Exo 0748–676
We report the detection of pulsations at 552 Hz in the rising phase of two type-I (thermonuclear) X-ray bursts observed from the accreting neutron star EXO 0748–676 in 2007 January and December, by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. The fractional amplitude was 15% (rms). The dynamic power density spectrum for each burst revealed an increase in frequency of ≈1-2 Hz while the oscillation was present. The frequency drift, the high significance of the detections and the almost identical signal frequencies measured in two bursts separated by 11 months, confirms this signal as a burst oscillation similar to those found in 13 other sources to date. We thus conclude that the spin frequency in EXO 0748 – 676 is within a few Hz of 552 Hz, rather than 45 Hz as was suggested from an earlier signal detection by Villarreal & Strohmayer. Consequently, Doppler broadening must significantly affect spectral features arising from the neutron star surface, so that the narrow absorption features previously reported from an XMM-Newton spectrum could not have arisen there. The origin of both the previously reported 45 Hz oscillation and the X-ray absorption lines is now uncertain.

Opticin exerts its anti-angiogenic activity by regulating extracellular matrix adhesiveness.
Opticin is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein that we identified associated with the collagen network of the vitreous humor of the eye. Recently, we discovered that opticin possesses anti-angiogenic activity using a murine oxygen-induced retinopathy model: here, we investigate the underlying mechanism. Using an ex vivo chick chorioallantoic membrane assay, we show that opticin inhibits angiogenesis when stimulated by a range of growth factors. We show that it suppresses capillary morphogenesis, inhibits endothelial invasion, and promotes capillary network regression in three-dimensional matrices of collagen and Matrigel(TM). We then show that opticin binds to collagen and thereby competitively inhibits endothelial cell interactions with collagen via α(1)β(1) and α(2)β(1) integrins, thereby preventing the strong adhesion that is required for proangiogenic signaling via these integrins.

Arc magmas sourced from melange diapirs in subduction zones
At subduction zones, crustal material is recycled back into the mantle. A certain proportion, however, is returned to the overriding
plate via magmatism. The magmas show a characteristic range of compositions that have been explained by three-component
mixing in their source regions: hydrous fluids derived from subducted altered oceanic crust and components derived from the thin
sedimentary veneer are added to the depleted peridotite in the mantle beneath the volcanoes. However, currently no uniformly
accepted model exists for the physical mechanism that mixes the three components and transports them from the slab to the
magma source.
Here we present an integrated physico-chemical model of subduction zones that emerges from a review of the combined findings
of petrology, modelling, geophysics, and geochemistry: Intensely mixed metamorphic rock formations, so-called mélanges, form
along the slab-mantle interface and comprise the characteristic trace-element patterns of subduction-zone magmatic rocks. We
consider mélange formation the physical mixing process that is responsible for the geochemical three-component pattern of the
magmas. Blobs of low-density mélange material, so-called diapirs, rise buoyantly from the surface of the subducting slab and
provide a means of transport for well-mixed materials into the mantle beneath the volcanoes, where they produce melt. Our model
provides a consistent framework for the interpretation of geophysical, petrological and geochemical data of subduction zones.Author Posting. © The Author(s), 2012.

Effects of asenapine, olanzapine, and risperidone on psychotomimetic-induced reversal-learning deficits in the rat.
BACKGROUND: Asenapine is a new pharmacological agent for the acute treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. It has relatively higher affinity for serotonergic and alpha(2)-adrenergic than dopaminergic D(2) receptors. We evaluated the effects of asenapine, risperidone, and olanzapine on acute and subchronic psychotomimetic-induced disruption of cued reversal learning in rats. METHODS: After operant training, rats were treated acutely with d-amphetamine (0.75 mg/kg intraperitoneally i.p.) or phencyclidine (PCP; 1.5mg/kg i.p.) or subchronically with PCP (2mg/kg i.p. for 7 days). We assessed the effects of acute coadministration of asenapine, risperidone, or olanzapine on acute d-amphetamine- and PCP-induced deficits and the effects of long-term coadministration of these agents (for 28 additional days) on the deficits induced by subchronic PCP. RESULTS: Deficits in reversal learning induced by acute d-amphetamine were attenuated by risperidone (0.2mg/kg i.p.). Acute PCP-induced impairment of reversal learning was attenuated by acute asenapine (0.025 mg/kg subcutaneously s.c.), risperidone (0.2mg/kg i.p.), and olanzapine (1.0mg/kg i.p.). Subchronic PCP administration induced an enduring deficit that was attenuated by acute asenapine (0.075 mg/kg s.c.) and by olanzapine (1.5mg/kg i.p.). Asenapine (0.075 mg/kg s.c.), risperidone (0.2mg/kg i.p.), and olanzapine (1.0mg/kg i.p.) all showed sustained efficacy with chronic (29 days) treatment to improve subchronic PCP-induced impairments. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that asenapine may have beneficial effects in the treatment of cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia. However, this remains to be validated by further clinical evaluation.

Specific role of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase when tethered to the plasma membrane calcium pump in regulating the beta-adrenergic signal in the myocardium.
The cardiac neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) has been described as a modulator of cardiac contractility. We have demonstrated previously that isoform 4b of the sarcolemmal calcium pump (PMCA4b) binds to nNOS in the heart and that this complex regulates beta-adrenergic signal transmission in vivo. Here, we investigated whether the nNOS-PMCA4b complex serves as a specific signaling modulator in the heart. PMCA4b transgenic mice (PMCA4b-TG) showed a significant reduction in nNOS and total NOS activities as well as in cGMP levels in the heart compared with their wild type (WT) littermates. In contrast, PMCA4b-TG hearts showed an elevation in cAMP levels compared with the WT. Adult cardiomyocytes isolated from PMCA4b-TG mice demonstrated a 3-fold increase in Ser(16) phospholamban (PLB) phosphorylation as well as Ser(22) and Ser(23) cardiac troponin I (cTnI) phosphorylation at base line compared with the WT. In addition, the relative induction of PLB phosphorylation and cTnI phosphorylation following isoproterenol treatment was severely reduced in PMCA4b-TG myocytes, explaining the blunted physiological response to the beta-adrenergic stimulation. In keeping with the data from the transgenic animals, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes overexpressing PMCA4b showed a significant reduction in nitric oxide and cGMP levels. This was accompanied by an increase in cAMP levels, which led to an increase in both PLB and cTnI phosphorylation at base line. Elevated cAMP levels were likely due to the modulation of cardiac phosphodiesterase, which determined the balance between cGMP and cAMP following PMCA4b overexpression. In conclusion, these results showed that the nNOS-PMCA4b complex regulates contractility via cAMP and phosphorylation of both PLB and cTnI.

[peptide, mhc, cell, inhibitory, nk, complex]

A peptide antagonist disrupts NK cell inhibitory synapse formation.
Productive engagement of MHC class I by inhibitory NK cell receptors depends on the peptide bound by the MHC class I molecule. Peptide:MHC complexes that bind weakly to killer cell Ig-like receptors (KIRs) can antagonize the inhibition mediated by high-affinity peptide:MHC complexes and cause NK cell activation. We show that low-affinity peptide:MHC complexes stall inhibitory signaling at the step of Src homology protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 recruitment and do not go on to form the KIR microclusters induced by high-affinity peptide:MHC, which are associated with Vav dephosphorylation and downstream signaling. Furthermore, the low-affinity peptide:MHC complexes prevented the formation of KIR microclusters by high-affinity peptide:MHC. Thus, peptide antagonism of NK cells is an active phenomenon of inhibitory synapse disruption.

[risk, cardiovascular, drug, approach, cost]

Total cardiovascular risk approach to improve efficiency of cardiovascular prevention in resource constrain settings.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the population distribution of cardiovascular risk in eight low- and middle-income countries and compare the cost of drug treatment based on cardiovascular risk (cardiovascular risk thresholds ≥ 30%/≥ 40%) with single risk factor cutoff levels. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Using World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Society of Hypertension risk prediction charts, cardiovascular risk was categorized in a cross-sectional study of 8,625 randomly selected people aged 40-80 years (mean age, 54.6 years) from defined geographic regions of Nigeria, Iran, China, Pakistan, Georgia, Nepal, Cuba, and Sri Lanka. Cost estimates for drug therapy were calculated for three countries. RESULTS: A large fraction (90.0-98.9%) of the study population has a 10-year cardiovascular risk <20%. Only 0.2-4.8% are in the high-risk categories (≥ 30%). Adopting a total risk approach and WHO guidelines recommendations would restrict unnecessary drug treatment and reduce the drug costs significantly. CONCLUSION: Adopting a total cardiovascular risk approach instead of a single risk factor approach reduces health care expenditure by reducing drug costs. Therefore, limited resources can be more efficiently used to target high-risk people who will benefit the most. This strategy needs to be complemented with population-wide measures to shift the cardiovascular risk distribution of the whole population.

A PARALLAX DISTANCE AND MASS ESTIMATE FOR THE TRANSITIONAL MILLISECOND PULSAR SYSTEM J1023+0038
The recently discovered transitional millisecond pulsar system J1023+0038 exposes a crucial evolutionary phase of recycled neutron stars for multiwavelength study. The system, comprising the neutron star itself, its stellar companion, and the surrounding medium, is visible across the electromagnetic spectrum from the radio to X-ray/gamma-ray regimes and offers insight into the recycling phase of millisecond pulsar evolution. Here, we report on multiple-epoch astrometric observations with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) which give a system parallax of 0.731 ?? 0.022 milliarcseconds (mas) and a proper motion of 17.98 ?? 0.05 mas yr-1. By combining our results with previous optical observations, we are able to use the parallax distance of 1368+42 - 39 pc to estimate the mass of the pulsar to be 1.71 ?? 0.16 M sun, and we are also able to measure the three-dimensional space velocity of the system to be 126 ?? 5 km s-1. Despite the precise nature of the VLBA measurements, the remaining \ {}3\% distance uncertainty dominates the 0.16 M sun error on our mass estimate.

[vegf, psoriasis, investigational, antagonist, potential, receptor]

Investigational VEGF antagonists for psoriasis.
INTRODUCTION: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mediates angiogenesis consequent to binding to VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) and is upregulated in patients with psoriasis. VEGF is also upregulated in other diseases characterised by angiogenesis including proliferative retinopathy and cancer. Several VEGF antagonists have been approved for the treatment of these conditions and may also have the potential to treat psoriasis. AREAS COVERED: A PubMed literature search was performed to identify preclinical and clinical research regarding investigational VEGF antagonists for the treatment of psoriasis. Various agents have been reviewed including monoclonal antibodies against VEGF and VEGFRs, decoy anti-VEGF receptors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors that block the effects of VEGF/VEGFR binding. EXPERT OPINION: Several investigational drugs have demonstrated potential to treat psoriasis. Clinical observations of psoriasis remission following administration of bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib in cancer patients are encouraging. Of particular interest is a novel anti-VEGF/anti-TNF-α decoy receptor (Valpha), whose dual action could be beneficial given the numerous pathogenetic pathways in psoriasis. A topical tyrosine kinase inhibitor also has potential given the cost and safety advantages conferred by this mode of administration. More research is warranted both in the prototypical drugs and in those already marketed for other indications.

Functional renormalization group for few-nucleon systems: SU(4) symmetry and its breaking
We apply the functional renormalization group to few-nucleon systems. Our starting point is a local effective action that includes three- and four-nucleon interactions, expressed in terms of nucleon and two-nucleon boson fields. The evolution of the coupling constants in this action is described by a renormalization group flow. We derive these flow equations both in the limit of exact Wigner SU(4) symmetry and in the realistic case of broken symmetry. In the symmetric limit we find that the renormalization flow equations decouple and can be combined into two sets, one of which matches the known results for bosons, and the other result matches the one for a single flavor of spin 1/2 fermions. The equations show universal features in the unitary limit, which is obtained when the two-body scattering length tends to infinity. We calculate the spin-quartet neutron-deuteron scattering length and the deuteron-deuteron scattering lengths in the spin-singlet and spin-quintet channels.

Design of Resonant Clock Distribution Networks for 3-D Integrated Circuits
Designing a low power clock network in synchronous circuits is an important task. This requirement is stricter for 3-D circuits due to the increased power densities. Resonant clock networks are considered efficient low-power alternatives to conventional clock distribution schemes. These networks utilize additional inductive circuits to reduce the power consumption while delivering a full swing clock signal to the sink nodes. A design method for 3-D resonant clock networks is presented. The proposed design technique supports resonant operation for pre-bond test, an important requirement for 3-D ICs. Several 3-D clock network topologies are explored in a 0.18 μm CMOS technology. Simulation results indicate 43% reduction in the power consumed by the resonant 3-D clock network as compared to a conventional buffered clock network.

Premature death after self-harm: a multicentre cohort study
BACKGROUND: People who self-harm have an increased risk of premature death. The aim of this study was to investigate cause-specific premature death in individuals who self-harm, including associations with socioeconomic deprivation. METHODS: We undertook a cohort study of patients of all ages presenting to emergency departments in Oxford, Manchester, and Derby, UK, after self-poisoning or self-injury between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2007. Postcodes of individuals' place of residence were linked to the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2007 in England. Mortality information was supplied by the Medical Research Information Service of the National Health Service. Patients were followed up to the end of 2009. We calculated age-standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and years of life lost (YLL), and we tested for associations with socioeconomic deprivation. FINDINGS: 30 950 individuals presented with self-harm and were followed up for a median of 6·0 years (IQR 3·9-7·9). 1832 (6·1%) patients died before the end of follow-up. Death was more likely in patients than in the general population (SMR 3·6, 95% CI 3·5-3·8), and occurred more in males (4·1, 3·8-4·3) than females (3·2, 2·9-3·4). Deaths due to natural causes were 2-7·5 times more frequent than was expected. For individuals who died of any cause, mean YLL was 31·4 years (95% CI 30·5-32·2) for male patients and 30·7 years (29·5-31·9) for female patients. Mean YLL for natural-cause deaths was 25·9 years (25·7-26·0) for male patients and 25·5 years (25·2-25·8) for female patients, and for external-cause deaths was 40·2 years (40·0-40·3) and 40·0 years (39·7-40·5), respectively. Disease of the circulatory (13·1% in males; 13·0% in females) and digestive (11·7% in males; 17·8% in females) systems were major contributors to YLL from natural causes. All-cause mortality increased with each quartile of socioeconomic deprivation in male patients (χ(2) trend 39·6; p<0·0001), female patients (13·9; p=0·0002), and both sexes combined (55·4; p<0·0001). Socioeconomic deprivation was related to mortality in both sexes combined from natural causes (51·0; p<0·0001) but not from external causes (0·30; p=0·58). Alcohol problems were associated with death from digestive-system disease, drug misuse with mental and behavioural disorders, and physical health problems with circulatory-system disease. INTERPRETATION: Physical health and life expectancy are severely compromised in individuals who self-harm compared with the general population. In the management of self-harm, clinicians assessing patients' psychosocial problems should also consider their physical needs. FUNDING: Department of Health Policy Research Programme.

Estimated portion sizes in a school-aged population.
OBJECTIVE: To produce study-specific portion sizes for 11-year-old children in a population-based birth cohort and to compare these study-specific portion sizes with previously published children's portion sizes, to assess their relevance today. DESIGN: Two multiple-pass 24 h dietary recalls were taken. The Food Standard Agency's photographic food atlas was used to quantify intakes. Study-specific food portion sizes were calculated for each food group. Portion sizes were calculated for all children and separately for boys and girls. The nutrient intake from the 24 h dietary recalls was analysed using study-specific and published portion sizes for individual participants. Agreement was assessed using Pearson's correlation, intra-class correlation coefficients and the Bland-Altman method. SETTING: Birth cohort study, UK. SUBJECTS: Children (mean age 11.3 years, n 264) and parents/guardians. RESULTS: A total of 124 food portion sizes were calculated. Differences in portion weights between boys and girls were seen only for seven food items. There was a significant positive relationship (P < 0.001) between intakes of each nutrient as determined by the two sets of portion sizes. Correlation coefficients ranged from 0.77 (protein) to 0.98 (β-carotene). The intra-class correlation coefficients showed good agreement between nutrient intakes determined by the study-specific and published portion sizes (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Nutrient intakes calculated using portion sizes from our population were similar to those calculated from portion size data collected in a national survey, despite being collected over a decade later. The present study adds to the small amount of evidence regarding portion sizes in UK children and shows agreement with previously published paediatric portion sizes.

[ctc, tumour, detection, metastasis, cancer]

Circulating tumour cells, their role in metastasis and their clinical utility in lung cancer.
Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) have attracted much recent interest in cancer research as a potential biomarker and as a means of studying the process of metastasis. It has long been understood that metastasis is a hallmark of malignancy, and conceptual theories on the basis of metastasis from the nineteenth century foretold the existence of a tumour "seed" which is capable of establishing discrete tumours in the "soil" of distant organs. This prescient "seed and soil" hypothesis accurately predicted the existence of CTCs; microscopic tumour fragments in the blood, at least some of which are capable of forming metastases. However, it is only in recent years that reliable, reproducible methods of CTC detection and analysis have been developed. To date, the majority of studies have employed the CellSearch™ system (Veridex LLC), which is an immunomagnetic purification method. Other promising techniques include microfluidic filters, isolation of tumour cells by size using microporous polycarbonate filters and flow cytometry-based approaches. While many challenges still exist, the detection of CTCs in blood is becoming increasingly feasible, giving rise to some tantalizing questions about the use of CTCs as a potential biomarker. CTC enumeration has been used to guide prognosis in patients with metastatic disease, and to act as a surrogate marker for disease response during therapy. Other possible uses for CTC detection include prognostication in early stage patients, identifying patients requiring adjuvant therapy, or in surveillance, for the detection of relapsing disease. Another exciting possible use for CTC detection assays is the molecular and genetic characterization of CTCs to act as a "liquid biopsy" representative of the primary tumour. Indeed it has already been demonstrated that it is possible to detect HER2, KRAS and EGFR mutation status in breast, colon and lung cancer CTCs respectively. In the course of this review, we shall discuss the biology of CTCs and their role in metastagenesis, the most commonly used techniques for their detection and the evidence to date of their clinical utility, with particular reference to lung cancer.

Inhibition of T1/ST2 during respiratory syncytial virus infection prevents T helper cell type 2 (Th2)- but not Th1-driven immunopathology.
T cells secreting interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5 (T helper cell type 2 Th2 cells) play a detrimental role in a variety of diseases, but specific methods of regulating their activity remain elusive. T1/ST2 is a surface ligand of the IL-1 receptor family, expressed on Th2- but not on interferon (IFN)-gamma-producing Th1 cells. Prior exposure of BALB/c mice to the attachment (G) or fusion (F) protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) increases illness severity during intranasal RSV challenge, due to Th2-driven lung eosinophilia and exuberant Th1-driven pulmonary infiltration, respectively. We used these polar models of viral illness to study the recruitment of T1/ST2 cells to the lung and to test the effects of anti-T1/ST2 treatment in vivo. T1/ST2 was present on a subset of CD4(+) cells from mice with eosinophilic lung disease. Monoclonal anti-T1/ST2 treatment reduced lung inflammation and the severity of illness in mice with Th2 (but not Th1) immunopathology. These results show that inhibition of T1/ST2 has a specific effect on virally induced Th2 responses and suggests that therapy targeted at this receptor might be of value in treating Th2-driven illness.

Characterization of the Interface Region During the Agglomeration of Silicon Nanocrystals in Silicon Dioxide
<p>Si nanocrystals embedded in thermally grown SiO2 have been annealed at temperatures between 400 and 900 degreesC in a variety of atmospheres. Positron annihilation spectroscopy has been employed to study changes in the interface regions between nanocrystalline Si (nc-Si) and SiO2 with the support of photoluminescence measurements. We find that nitrogen and oxygen are trapped in the voids around nc-Si at low annealing temperatures. High-temperature annealing during the formation of nc-Si causes hydrogen originally residing in the SiO2/substrate region to enter the SiO2 structure. Hydrogen diffuse back to the SiO2/substrate region on annealing in vacuum at 400 degreesC because no other impurities block its diffusion channels. At annealing temperatures above 700 degreesC, both nitrogen and oxygen react with nc-Si, resulting in a volume increase. This introduces stress in the SiO2 matrix, which is relaxed by the shrinkage of its intrinsic open volume. The present data suggest that nitrogen suppresses Si diffusion in SiO2, so that the agglomeration of nc-Si is slower during annealing in nitrogen than in oxygen or vacuum.</p>

We find a violation of Matthiessen's rule that can be explained by a model of sigma involving a defect-assisted interlayer channel which acts in parallel with the bandlike conductivity. We observe an unusual dependence of T-c on residual resistivity, inconsistent with the generalized Abrikosov-Gor'kov theory for an order parameter with a single component, providing an important constraint on models of the superconductivity in this material.</p>

[disease, imaging, molecular]

Noninvasive molecular imaging of neuroinflammation.
Inflammation is a highly dynamic and complex adaptive process to preserve and restore tissue homeostasis. Originally viewed as an immune-privileged organ, the central nervous system (CNS) is now recognized to have a constant interplay with the innate and the adaptive immune systems, where resident microglia and infiltrating immune cells from the periphery have important roles. Common diseases of the CNS, such as stroke, multiple sclerosis (MS), and neurodegeneration, elicit a neuroinflammatory response with the goal to limit the extent of the disease and to support repair and regeneration. However, various disease mechanisms lead to neuroinflammation (NI) contributing to the disease process itself. Molecular imaging is the method of choice to try to decipher key aspects of the dynamic interplay of various inducers, sensors, transducers, and effectors of the orchestrated inflammatory response in vivo in animal models and patients. Here, we review the basic principles of NI with emphasis on microglia and common neurologic disease mechanisms, the molecular targets which are being used and explored for imaging, and molecular imaging of NI in frequent neurologic diseases, such as stroke, MS, neurodegeneration, epilepsy, encephalitis, and gliomas.

RAC activity in keloid disease: comparative analysis of fibroblasts from margin of keloid to its surrounding normal skin.
BACKGROUND: Keloids are characterized by excess collagen deposition within the dermis. Although the exact cause of the potentially overactive fibroblasts has yet to be elucidated, many etiological possibilities have been suggested. As fibroblasts originating from keloids appear to have an increased migration and proliferation rate, cell-signaling studies examining these factors may offer an opportunity to further our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease. One of such cell-signaling messengers is the enzyme Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (RAC), which has never been investigated in keloid scars. OBJECTIVE: This study explores the role of RAC activity in keloid disease. METHOD: Primary fibroblast cell lines were established from the margin of keloid (KF) scars as well as from the surrounding normal tissue (NF) from one anatomical site of the same patient. Migration and proliferation assays were performed, comparing matching NFs and KFs, and after cell lysis, RAC activity was assessed. RESULTS: Comparing fibroblasts from 3 different patients, KFs migrated (P < .05) and proliferated (P < .05) faster than NFs. The activity levels of RAC were increased in KFs compared with NFs. CONCLUSION: KFs migrate and proliferate faster than NFs. RAC activity increases in KFs when compared with NFs. Inhibition of RAC could lead to a new therapeutic approach.

Poor uptake of hepatitis B immunization amongst hospital-based health care staff.
The uptake of hepatitis B vaccine was assessed amongst 100 medical and 100 nursing staff in a teaching hospital with a policy of recommending to those at risk that they should seek immunization from their general practitioners. Sixteen per cent of nurses and 31% of doctors had completed a course of immunization with confirmation of seroconversion. An additional 9% and 18% respectively had been immunized without post-immunization serology. Ninety three per cent of nurses and 61% of doctors who had not been immunized would like to receive the vaccine. The commonest reasons for non-immunization amongst nurses were fear of vaccine and lack of advice, and amongst doctors, apathy and difficulty in obtaining the vaccine. Eighty seven per cent of medical staff and 57% of nurses had a history of needle stick injury. The low rates of vaccine uptake in this study combined with the high incidence of needle stick injury calls for a reappraisal of present hepatitis B vaccination programmes in hospitals. In particular the abrogation of responsibility for immunization to general practitioners is probably a major disincentive to potential vaccines.

The magnetoresistance of these films can be described well using a simplified model that incorporates gradation of properties away from the InSb/GaAs interface and the interplay between conduction and impurity bands. Although there is no significant intrinsic contribution in InSb bulk crystalline (001) materials due to its isotropic Fermi surface and mobility tensor, the linear and quadratic terms in the magnetoresistance as well as the overall magnitude can be tuned by varying the film thickness from 100 to 2000 nm.</p>

Activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid-3 inhibits human hair growth.
In the current study, we aimed at identifying the functional role of transient receptor potential vanilloid-3 (TRPV3) ion channel in the regulation of human hair growth. Using human organ-cultured hair follicles (HFs) and cultures of human outer root sheath (ORS) keratinocytes, we provide the first evidence that activation of TRPV3 inhibits human hair growth. TRPV3 immunoreactivity was confined to epithelial compartments of the human HF, mainly to the ORS. In organ culture, TRPV3 activation by plant-derived (e.g., eugenol, 10-1,000 μM) or synthetic (e.g., 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, 1-300 μM) agonists resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of hair shaft elongation, suppression of proliferation, and induction of apoptosis and premature HF regression (catagen). Human ORS keratinocytes also expressed functional TRPV3, whose stimulation induced membrane currents, elevated intracellular calcium concentration, inhibited proliferation, and induced apoptosis. Of great importance, these effects on ORS keratinocytes were all mediated by TRPV3, as small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of TRPV3 effectively abrogated the cellular actions of the above agonists. These findings collectively support the concept that TRPV3 signaling is a significant player in human hair growth control. Therefore, TRPV3 and the related intracellular signaling mechanism might function as a promising target for pharmacological manipulations of clinically relevant hair growth disorders.

Cell surface organization of stress-inducible proteins ULBP and MICA that stimulate human NK cells and T cells via NKG2D.
Cell surface proteins major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-related chain A (MICA) and UL16-binding proteins (ULBP) 1, 2, and 3 are up-regulated upon infection or tumor transformation and can activate human natural killer (NK) cells. Patches of cross-linked raft resident ganglioside GM1 colocalized with ULBP1, 2, 3, or MICA, but not CD45. Thus, ULBPs and MICA are expressed in lipid rafts at the cell surface. Western blotting revealed that glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored ULBP3 but not transmembrane MICA, MHC class I protein, or transferrin receptor, accumulated in detergent-resistant membranes containing GM1. Thus, MICA may have a weaker association with lipid rafts than ULBP3, yet both proteins accumulate at an activating human NK cell immune synapse. Target cell lipid rafts marked by green fluorescent protein-tagged GPI also accumulate with ULBP3 at some synapses. Electron microscopy reveals constitutive clusters of ULBP at the cell surface. Regarding a specific molecular basis for the organization of these proteins, ULBP1, 2, and 3 and MICA are lipid modified. ULBP1, 2, and 3 are GPI anchored, and we demonstrate here that MICA is S-acylated. Finally, expression of a truncated form of MICA that lacks the putative site for S-acylation and the cytoplasmic tail can be expressed at the cell surface, but is unable to activate NK cells.

Vinculin Regulates the Recruitment and Release of Core Focal Adhesion Proteins in a Force-Dependent Manner
BackgroundCells sense the extracellular environment using adhesion receptors (integrins) linked to the intracellular actin cytoskeleton through a complex network of regulatory proteins that, all together, form focal adhesions (FAs). The molecular basis of how these sensing units are regulated, how they are implicated in transducing mechanical stimuli, and how this leads to a spatiotemporal coordination of FAs is unclear.ResultsHere we show that vinculin, through its links to the talin-integrin complex and F-actin, regulates the transmission of mechanical signals from the extracellular matrix to the actomyosin machinery. We demonstrate that the vinculin interaction with the talin-integrin complex drives the recruitment and release of core FA components. The activation state of vinculin is itself regulated by force, as underscored by our observation that vinculin localization to FAs is dependent on actomyosin contraction. Using a variety of vinculin mutants, we establish which components of the cell-matrix adhesion network are coordinated through direct and indirect associations with vinculin. Moreover, using cyclic stretching, we demonstrate that vinculin plays a key role in the transmission of extracellular mechanical stimuli leading to the reorganization of cell polarity. Of particular importance is the actin-binding tail region of vinculin, without which the cell’s ability to repolarize in response to cyclic stretching is perturbed.ConclusionsOverall our data promote a model whereby vinculin controls the transmission of intracellular and extracellular mechanical cues that are important for the spatiotemporal assembly, disassembly, and reorganization of FAs to coordinate polarized cell motility.

Anidulafungin for neonatal hematogenous Candida meningoencephalitis: identification of candidate regimens for humans using a translational pharmacological approach.
Hematogenous Candida meningoencephalitis (HCME) is a serious infection in premature neonates. Anidulafungin is an echinocandin antifungal agent with potent activity against Candida spp., but its efficacy and optimal regimens for human neonates with HCME are not known. A well-validated rabbit model of HCME was used to define pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) relationships of anidulafungin. A mathematical model was fitted to the entire data set. The experimental data were bridged to humans. A population PK model was fitted to the data from human neonates receiving anidulafungin receiving a loading dose of 3 mg/kg, followed by 1.5 mg/kg/day. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to identify candidate anidulafungin regimens for humans. All untreated rabbits succumbed by ≤96 h postinoculation. The PK of anidulafungin was linear with dose-dependent penetration into the cerebrum. Anidulafungin exerted a rapid antifungal effect that was apparent in the first dosing interval. Near-maximal antifungal activity was observed with dosages of 10 to 20 mg/kg/day. The bridging studies suggested that the current regimen of first 3 mg/kg, followed by 1.5 mg/kg/day, is suboptimal. Higher dosages were associated with progressively greater antifungal effect. Anidulafungin is effective for the treatment of experimental HCME. Higher dosages than those currently used for clinical care are required for maximal antifungal effect.

The role of biological production in pleistocene atmospheric carbon dioxide variations and the nitrogen isotope dynamics of the southern ocean
This dissertation contributes to the search for a cause of glacial/interglacial variations in
atmospheric carbon dioxide. The hypotheses addressed involve changes in low and high-latitude
biological export production.
A modelling exercise demonstrates that the paleoceanographic record of calcite preservation
places constraints on hypothesized changes in low latitude biological production. The
model results indicate that large, production-driven changes in the depth of the calcite
saturation horizon during the last ice age would have caused a similar deepening of the
calcite lysocline, even when the effect of sediment respiration-driven dissolution is
considered. Such a large glacial lysocline deepening is not evident on an ocean-average
basis. The results indicate very few mechanisms by which low latitude production could
have driven Pleisotocene carbon dioxide variations, generally arguing against a low latitude
cause for these variations.
The use of N isotopes as a paleoceanographic proxy for nitrate utilization in Southern
Ocean was investigated. In order to examine the generation of the link between nitrate
utilization and N isotopes in the surface ocean, the isotopic composition of nitrate was
studied. The first step in this work was the development of a new method to measure the
isotopic composition of nitrate which is amenable to the generation of large, precise data
sets. Results from the Southern Ocean demonstrate that the Antarctic and Subantarctic
represent distinct regimes of N isotope dynamics. The findings support the use of N
isotopes as a proxy for nitrate utilization in the Antarctic.
A study of diatom microfossil-bound N in sediments suggests that this N is native to the
diatoms, that it is invulnerable to early diagenesis, and that its isotopic compositon varies
with that of the sinking flux. Paleoceanographic records of diatom-bound N isotopic
composition corroborate the conclusion, previously based on bulk sediment isotopic data, that nitrate utilization was elevated in the glacial Antarctic, representing a major cause of
lower glacial atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution September 1997This research was supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate

Sandwich placements in law: academic tourism or a form of clinical legal education?
<p>Whether or not education at the higher level can be integrated with practical experience has preoccupied educationalists in Europe and North America for a considerable time. There are some disciplines in which the existence of laboratory practice or simulated work experience can be used to assist the process of learning-by-doing quite efficiently. In other areas, learning from experience may be best carried out in the employment environment itself. Historically, in the UK this was the pattern for the traditional professions of law, accountancy, medicine and architecture. More recently in the UK, sandwich courses, predominantly a 'new' university contribution to higher education, have been developed to give students a balance between academic theory and practical professional experience. This article attempts a re-evaluation of the sandwich placement model of legal education in law in the light of the skills debate, and the clinical legal education movement.</p>

Longitudinal analyses of gut mucosal microbiotas in ulcerative colitis in relation to patient age and disease severity and duration.
Bacteria belonging to the normal colonic microbiota are associated with the etiology of ulcerative colitis (UC). Although several mucosal species have been implicated in the disease process, the organisms and mechanisms involved are unknown. The aim of this investigation was to characterize mucosal biofilm communities over time and to determine the relationship of these bacteria to patient age and disease severity and duration. Multiple rectal biopsy specimens were taken from 33 patients with active UC over a period of 1 year. Real-time PCR was used to quantify mucosal bacteria in UC patients compared to 18 noninflammatory bowel disease controls, and the relationship between indicators of disease severity and bacterial colonization was evaluated by linear regression analysis. Significant differences were detected in bacterial populations on the UC mucosa and in the control group, which varied over the study period. High clinical activity indices (CAI) and sigmoidoscopy scores (SS) were associated with enterobacteria, desulfovibrios, type E Clostridium perfringens, and Enterococcus faecalis, whereas the reverse was true for Clostridium butyricum, Ruminococcus albus, and Eubacterium rectale. Lactobacillus and bifidobacterium numbers were linked with low CAI. Only E. rectale and Clostridium clostridioforme had a high age dependence. These findings demonstrated that longitudinal variations in mucosal bacterial populations occur in UC and that bacterial community structure is related to disease severity.

Dynamically-Driven Timed Automaton Abstractions for Proving Liveness of Continuous Systems
We look at the problem of proving inevitability of continuousdynamical systems. An inevitability property says that a region of thestate space will eventually be reached: this is a type of liveness propertyfrom the computer science viewpoint, and is related to attractivity of setsin dynamical systems. We consider a method of Maler and Batt to makean abstraction of a continuous dynamical system to a timed automaton,and show that a potentially infinite number of splits will be made if thesplitting of the state space is made arbitrarily. To solve this problem, wedefine a method which creates a finite-sized timed automaton abstractionfor a class of linear dynamical systems, and show that this timedabstraction proves inevitability.

[skin, ageing, elastic]

A new wrinkle on old skin: the role of elastic fibres in skin ageing.
Synopsis Cutaneous ageing is the result of two distinct, biological processes which may occur concurrently: (i) the passage of time, termed intrinsic ageing and (ii) environmental influences, termed extrinsic ageing. Intrinsic ageing of the skin is a slow process which causes changes in tissue structure and impairs function in the absence of additional biological, chemical and physical factors. The clinical features of intrinsically aged skin are not usually evident until old age when, although smooth and unblemished, the skin surface appears pale and is characterized by fine wrinkles with occasional exaggerated expression lines. Functionally, intrinsically aged skin is dry and less elastic than more youthful skin. In contrast, extrinsically aged skin is exemplified by deep, coarse wrinkles, mottled hyperpigmentation and a marked loss of elasticity and recoil. The two major environmental influences which induce extrinsic ageing are: (i) chronic exposure to solar ultraviolet (UV) irradiation (termed photoageing) and (ii) smoking. This review discusses the changes associated with the ageing process in the skin, with particular emphasis on the role played by the elastic fibre network in maintaining dermal function. The review concludes with a discussion of a short-term assay for independent assessment of the efficacy of anti-ageing cosmetic products using the elastic fibre component fibrillin-1 as a biomarker of extracellular matrix repair.

[ncc, gut, neural, hscr, cell, migration, crest]

Balancing neural crest cell intrinsic processes with those of the microenvironment in Tcof1 haploinsufficient mice enables complete enteric nervous system formation.
The enteric nervous system (ENS) comprises a complex neuronal network that regulates peristalsis of the gut wall and secretions into the lumen. The ENS is formed from a multipotent progenitor cell population called the neural crest, which is derived from the neuroepithelium. Neural crest cells (NCCs) migrate over incredible distances to colonize the entire length of the gut and during their migration they must survive, proliferate and ultimately differentiate. The absence of an ENS from variable lengths of the colon results in Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) or colonic aganglionosis. Mutations in about 12 different genes have been identified in HSCR patients but the complex pattern of inheritance and variable penetrance suggests that additional genes or modifiers must be involved in the etiology and pathogenesis of this disease. We discovered that Tcof1 haploinsufficiency in mice models many of the early features of HSCR. Neuroepithelial apoptosis diminished the size of the neural stem cell pool resulting in reduced NCC numbers and their delayed migration along the gut from E10.5 to E14.5. Surprisingly however, we observe continued and complete colonization of the entire colon throughout E14.5-E18.5, a period in which the gut is considered to be non- or less-permissive to NCC. Thus, we reveal for the first time that reduced NCC progenitor numbers and delayed migration do not unequivocally equate with a predisposition for the pathogenesis of HSCR. In fact, these deficiencies can be overcome by balancing NCC intrinsic processes of proliferation and differentiation with extrinsic influences of the gut microenvironment.

[phase, bulk, surface, nucleation, transition, hard]

Continuity of the nucleation of bulk and surface phases
<p>Nucleation of a new bulk phase is almost always heterogeneous: It occurs at a surface. Nucleation of a new surface phase also occurs at a surface of course. We study nucleation in an Ising model with both bulk and surface (prewetting) transitions. We find no clear distinction between nucleation of the bulk and surface phases. As the bulk transition is crossed, the phase that is nucleating changes from being a new surface phase to being a new bulk phase. However, neither the nucleation rate nor the nucleus itself changes discontinuously. It appears that because the nucleus is only approximately two spins high, it is oblivious to the fact that on one side of the bulk transition it will grow to form a thick wetting layer, while on the other side it will grow to form a bulk phase of limitless thickness. The phase diagram of hard spheres at a hard wall is analogous to that of our model. Therefore, we suggest that the nucleation of the crystal phase of hard spheres at a hard wall may also be indistinguishable from that associated with a prefreezing surface transition.</p>

Positive response of a recurrent keloid scar to topical methyl aminolevulinate-photodynamic therapy.
A 36-year-old Caucasian female of Iranian origin presented with a persistently raised dermal lesion under her chin, confirmed histologically to be a keloid scar. There was a 4-year history of a negative response to a range of conventional treatments including topical silicone gel sheets, steroid creams, steroid injections and surgical excision. In view of treatment failure and an in vitro study indicating a positive effect of photodynamic therapy (PDT)on keloid fibroblasts, we treated our patient's lesion with five sessions of methyl aminolevulinate photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT) over a period of 5 months. Following this treatment regime, her keloid scar had considerably reduced in size and become flattened.The surface of the keloid also became smooth, with attenuation in erythema at the margin as well as an improvement in the colour of the scar, which was better matched to the surrounding skin. There was no recurrence at 1-year follow-up and this treatment resulted in an overall acceptable cosmetic outcome. This case report presents PDT as a potential treatment option for persistent keloid lesions unresponsive to conventional scar modulation therapies and suggests a need for further research in this area.

[dc, cd11c, infection, cell, chronic]

Chronic helminth infection promotes immune regulation in vivo through dominance of CD11cloCD103- dendritic cells.
Gastrointestinal helminth infections are extremely prevalent in many human populations and are associated with downmodulated immune responsiveness. In the experimental model system of Heligmosomoides polygyrus, a chronic infection establishes in mice, accompanied by a modulated Th2 response and increased regulatory T cell (Treg) activity. To determine if dendritic cell (DC) populations in the lymph nodes draining the intestine are responsible for the regulatory effects of chronic infection, we first identified a population of CD11c(lo) nonplasmacytoid DCs that expand after chronic H. polygyrus infection. The CD11c(lo) DCs are underrepresented in magnetic bead-sorted preparations and spared from deletion in CD11c-diptheria toxin receptor mice. After infection, CD11c(lo) DCs did not express CD8, CD103, PDCA, or Siglec-H and were poorly responsive to TLR stimuli. In DC/T cell cocultures, CD11c(lo) DCs from naive and H. polygyrus-infected mice could process and present protein Ag, but induced lower levels of Ag-specific CD4(+) T cell proliferation and effector cytokine production, and generated higher percentages of Foxp3(+) T cells in the presence of TGF-β. Treg generation was also dependent on retinoic acid receptor signaling. In vivo, depletion of CD11c(hi) DCs further favored the dominance of the CD11c(lo) DC phenotype. After CD11c(hi) DC depletion, effector responses were inhibited dramatically, but the expansion in Treg numbers after H. polygyrus infection was barely compromised, showing a significantly higher regulatory/effector CD4(+) T cell ratio compared with that of CD11c(hi) DC-intact animals. Thus, the proregulatory environment of chronic intestinal helminth infection is associated with the in vivo predominance of a newly defined phenotype of CD11c(lo) tolerogenic DCs.

[reactivity, chemical, allergen, respiratory, peptide, competitive, condition, selectivity, lysine, assay]

The selective peptide reactivity of chemical respiratory allergens under competitive and non-competitive conditions.
It is well established that certain chemicals cause respiratory allergy. In common with contact allergens, chemicals that induce sensitization of the respiratory tract must form stable associations with host proteins to elicit an immune response. Measurement of the reactivity of chemical allergens to single nucleophilic peptides is increasingly well-described, and standardized assays have been developed for use in hazard assessment. This study employed standard and modified peptide reactivity assays to investigate the selectivity of chemical respiratory allergens for individual amino acids under competitive and non-competitive conditions. The reactivity of 20 known chemical respiratory sensitizers (including diisocyanates, anhydrides, and reactive dyes) were evaluated for reactivity towards individual peptides containing cysteine, lysine, histidine, arginine, or tyrosine. Respiratory allergens exhibited the common ability to deplete both lysine and cysteine peptides; however, reactivity for histidine, arginine, and tyrosine varied between chemicals, indicating differences in relative binding affinity toward each nucleophile. To evaluate amino acid selectivity for cysteine and lysine under competitive conditions a modified assay was used in which reaction mixtures contained different relative concentrations of the target peptides. Under these reaction conditions, the binding preferences of reference respiratory and contact allergens (dinitrochlorobenzene, dinitrofluorobenzene) were evaluated. Discrete patterns of reactivity were observed showing various levels of competitive selectivity between the two allergen classes.

Using the "reverse Warburg effect" to identify high-risk breast cancer patients: stromal MCT4 predicts poor clinical outcome in triple-negative breast cancers.
We have recently proposed a new model of cancer metabolism to explain the role of aerobic glycolysis and L-lactate production in fueling tumor growth and metastasis. In this model, cancer cells secrete hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), initiating oxidative stress and aerobic glycolysis in the tumor stroma. This, in turn, drives L-lactate secretion from cancer-associated fibroblasts. Secreted L-lactate then fuels oxidative mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS) in epithelial cancer cells, by acting as a paracrine onco-metabolite. We have previously termed this type of two-compartment tumor metabolism the "Reverse Warburg Effect," as aerobic glycolysis takes place in stromal fibroblasts, rather than epithelial cancer cells. Here, we used MCT4 immuno-staining of human breast cancer tissue microarrays (TMAs; > 180 triple-negative patients) to directly assess the prognostic value of the "Reverse Warburg Effect." MCT4 expression is a functional marker of hypoxia, oxidative stress, aerobic glycolysis, and L-lactate efflux. Remarkably, high stromal MCT4 levels (score = 2) were specifically associated with decreased overall survival (< 18% survival at 10 y post-diagnosis). In contrast, patients with absent stromal MCT4 expression (score = 0), had 10-y survival rates of ~97% (p-value < 10 (-32) ). High stromal levels of MCT4 were strictly correlated with a loss of stromal Cav-1 (p-value < 10 (-14) ), a known marker of early tumor recurrence and metastasis. In fact, the combined use of stromal Cav-1 and stromal MCT4 allowed us to more precisely identify high-risk triple-negative breast cancer patients, consistent with the goal of individualized risk-assessment and personalized cancer treatment. However, epithelial MCT4 staining had no prognostic value, indicating that the "conventional" Warburg effect does not predict clinical outcome. Thus, the "Reverse Warburg Effect" or "parasitic" energy-transfer is a key determinant of poor overall patient survival. As MCT4 is a druggable-target, MCT4 inhibitors should be developed for the treatment of aggressive breast cancers, and possibly other types of human cancers. Similarly, we discuss how stromal MCT4 could be used as a biomarker for identifying high-risk cancer patients that could likely benefit from treatment with FDA-approved drugs or existing MCT-inhibitors (such as, AR-C155858, AR-C117977, and AZD-3965).

Fermionic measurement-based quantum computation
Fermions, as a major class of quantum particles, provide platforms for quantum information processing beyond the possibilities of spins or bosons, which have been studied more extensively. One particularly interesting model to study, in view of recent progress in manipulating ultracold fermion gases, is the fermionic version of measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC), which implements full quantum computation with only single-site measurements on a proper fermionic many-body resource state. However, it is not known which fermionic states can be used as the resource states for MBQC and how to find them. In this paper, we generalize the framework of spin MBQC to fermions. In particular, we provide a general formalism to construct many-body entangled fermion resource states for MBQC based on the fermionic projected entangled pair state representation. We give a specific fermionic state which enables universal MBQC and demonstrate that the nonlocality inherent in fermion systems can be properly taken care of with suitable measurement schemes. Such a framework opens up possibilities of finding MBQC resource states which can be more readily realized in the laboratory.

Cochlear implantation in a child with CINCA syndrome who also has wide vestibular aqueducts.
Chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular (CINCA) syndrome is a severe auto-inflammatory disease, due to mutation of the CIAS1 gene. CINCA syndrome should be considered the most severe of a spectrum of three disorders all due to mutation of the CIAS1 gene. CINCA syndrome produces a triad of symptoms of neonatal onset: maculopapular urticarial rash, chronic meningitis, and chronic non-inflammatory arthropathy with recurrent fever. CINCA syndrome is also associated with sensory organ damage, especially progressive hearing loss and loss of vision. In this case report, we present the first case of cochlear implantation in a 13-year-old child with CINCA syndrome. Cochlear implantation was successful at rehabilitating the hearing loss with the child able to continue mainstream education, with her academic performance and speech discrimination both showing marked improvement. Anakinra (an interleukin 1 receptor antagonist) is now in widespread use to treat CINCA syndrome and is known to rapidly reverse the inflammatory features of CINCA syndrome. However, current evidence suggests that anakinra has limited effectiveness in reversing the sensorineural hearing loss seen in CINCA syndrome. We therefore propose that cochlear implantation is a viable treatment option in this rare yet severe auto-inflammatory disease, if the patient has failed to respond to anakinra. Owing to the unknown pathogenesis of the progressive hearing loss seen in CINCA syndrome and the limited effectiveness of anakinra in reversing the progressive hearing loss, we suggest that cochlear implantation is the modality of choice in rehabilitating severe-to-profound hearing loss not responsive to anakinra.

A Phase Ib, Dose-Finding Study of Erlotinib in Combination With a Fixed Dose of Pertuzumab in Patients With Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.
BACKGROUND: Pertuzumab, a dimerization inhibitor of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), has demonstrated pharmacodynamic activity, with stable disease in non-small-cell lung cancer. Combining erlotinib and pertuzumab may enhance antitumor activity. This study aimed to establish the recommended dosing of the erlotinib and pertuzumab combination; assess safety, preliminary efficacy, and pharmacokinetics; and analyze biomarkers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with stage IIIb/IV non-small-cell lung cancer who failed chemotherapy were recruited. The patients received erlotinib (days -8 to -1), then combination therapy (21-day cycles for 6 cycles). Pertuzumab was given intravenous at 840 mg, then 420 mg once every three weeks, with erlotinib given daily (100 or 150 mg). RESULTS: No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Adverse events were generally grade 1/2 and manageable. The objective response rate was 20% (3/15 patients; 2 responders had mutant HER1, 1 responder had wild-type HER1), median overall progression-free survival was 9.3 weeks. High HER1, HER2, and HER3 messenger RNA expression correlated with increased progression-free survival. Combination therapy did not affect erlotinib's pharmacokinetics; however, pertuzumab mean exposures (maximum concentration, 231 mg/L; area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 21 days, 1780 mg*d/L) were slightly higher than in previous studies. CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy was well tolerated in patients with good performance status, with encouraging efficacy. A loading dose of pertuzumab 840 mg followed by 420 mg once every three weeks plus daily erlotinib 150 mg appears to be the most appropriate regimen for this combination.

Stimulation of neutrophil phagocytosis of Aspergillus fumigatus conidia by interleukin-8 and N-formylmethionyl-leucylphenylalanine.
The effect of the chemoattractants, interleukin-8 (IL-8) and N-formylmethionyl-leucylphenylalanine (fmlp) on neutrophil phagocytosis of serum-opsonised Aspergillus fumigatus conidia were studied. Pre-exposure of neutrophil monolayers to IL-8 (10-100 ng ml-1) or fmlp (10(-6)M) for 20 min increased phagocytosis from 15% to 35%. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in the numbers of conidia ingested by active neutrophils. The chemoattractants did not enhance phagocytosis of conidia when added contemporaneously to neutrophil monolayers. The ability of each chemoattractant to act as a primer for the other was investigated. It was found that fmlp could prime for IL-8 and fmlp enhancement of phagocytosis, but IL-8 could not. An increase from 15% to 55% in phagocytosis was seen at a pre-exposure concentration of 10(-5) M fmlp followed by an incubation period of 30 min in the presence of 20 ng ml-1 IL-8. There was no significant increase in the average number of internalized conidia under these conditions. The response of human neutrophils to priming stimuli may have important implications in the pathogenesis of aspergillosis.

UNLABELLED: ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Denmark has implemented a comprehensive, nationwide pharmaceutical information system, and this system has been evaluated by the Danish Council of Ethics. The system can be seen as an exemplar of a comprehensive health information system for clinical use. ANALYSIS: The paper analyses 1) how informed consent can be implemented in the system and how different implementations create different impacts on autonomy and control of information, and 2) arguments directed towards justifying not seeking informed consent in this context. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Based on the analysis a heuristic is provided which enables a ranking and estimation of the impact on autonomy and control of information of different options for consent to entry of data into the system and use of data from the system.The danger of routinisation of consent is identified.The Danish pharmaceutical information system raises issues in relation to autonomy and control of information, issues that will also occur in relation to other similar comprehensive health information systems. Some of these issues are well understood and their impact can be judged using the heuristic which is provided. More research is, however needed in relation to routinisation of consent.

Development of a Biophysically Detailed Model of the Human Atria for the Investigation of the Mechanisms of Atrial Arrhythmias
Atrial arrhythmias are the most prevalent sustained cardiac arrhythmias. Rates of hospitalisation and costs incurred to healthcare organisations are increasing in epidemic proportions. Despite this, the mechanisms of the transition from sinus rhythm to arrhythmic states are not well understood. The high level of regional electrical heterogeneity observed in the atria is thought to contribute towards the high prevalence of atrial arrhythmias. However, current computer models of the intact human atria only account for a small degree of this regional electrical heterogeneity, and do not include descriptions of the pacemaker regions of the sinoatrial node and the atrioventricular node.	In this project, a new computational model of the intact 3D human atria is developed. First, a new single cell model to simulate the electrical action potential of the human atrial myocyte is developed. This model more accurately simulated the experimentally observed properties of human atrial action potentials than previous models. A family of electrically heterogeneous models describing the major regions within the atria is then developed, including those of the sinoatrial- and atrioventricular- nodes. This set of regional cell models represents the most expansive and complete set currently available. It is demonstrated that the large range of different electrical properties results in a large range of action potential morphology and duration within the atria. Models of the effect of sympathetic and parasympathetic regulation on the electrical AP of the models of the atrial working myocardium and the pacemaker regions were also incorporated. This demonstrated that sympathetic regulation can increase the pacing rate of the sinoatrial node and the atrio-ventricular node, and has a complex dose dependent effect on the atrial working myocardium. Four distinct models of the effects of atrial fibrillation induced remodelling on the atrial working myocardium are developed. These characterised the effect of remodelling of IKur on the overall changes in action potential morphology and duration observed. It is shown that the presence or absence of remodelling of this channel accounts for two distinct observed morphologies.	A previous 3D anatomical model of the human atria is improved. First, detailed anatomical models for the sinoatrial node and the atrioventricular node are incorporated into the model. Second, it is further segmented to include regions for the pulmonary veins, atrio-ventricular ring, atrial septum and sinoatrial node block zone. This model is used to investigate the effects of sympathetic and parasympathetic regulation in the 3D atria. Finally, a detailed investigation of the underlying mechanisms of atrial fibrillation in the 3D atria, and the effect of electrical remodelling on the behaviour of atrial fibrillation, is performed using the detailed 3D model.  	This work represents a significant advance in 3D human atrial modelling. The anatomical model incorporates a greater level of complexity than previous models, and for the first time allowed investigation of the pacemaking mechanisms in the 3D intact human atria. The atrial fibrillation protocols are more physiologically relevant than previous models and have elucidated the roles that electrophysiological remodelling, electrical heterogeneity and structural anisotropy play in the development and maintenance of atrial fibrillation.

Rheological Properties of Fibrin Clots
A study of the rheological properties of fibrin, an important coagulant in human haemostasis, is presented in this MPhil thesis. Fibrin monomers are activated at the site of an injury to a blood vessel through the thrombin-induced cleavage of fibrinogen, a protein which circulates in the blood. These monomers self-assemble into networks by branching out and connecting with each other. This is the process which gives rise to a blood clot. There are a variety of factors which have an influence on the structure of the fibrin network, which in turn have an influence on the physical properties of the clot. The influence of two of these factors, fibrinogen concentration and thrombin concentration, is investigated in this paper. The motivation for this work is the need to determine what makes a perfect blood clot, and to find out if increasing the concentration of fibrinogen or thrombin increases the long-term stability of clots. Previous research has highlighted some of the remarkable rheological properties of this material, namely by frequency-dependent experiments. In this work frequency-independent measurements of the time evolution of fibrin clot rigidity, and how this is related to the concentration of thrombin and fibrinogen, are presented. Measurements were taken using a Bohlin Gemini HR Nano Rheometer over a period of 16 hours. Samples were prepared with Tris-EDTA buffer, both with the addition of salt and without, either with a fixed concentration of thrombin and varying fibrinogen, or with a fixed concentration of fibrinogen and varying thrombin. It was found that the time evolution of the rigidity exhibited three separate phases, characterised by a steady increase in rigidity, followed by a sharp increase, and ending with a plateau, during which rigidity ceased to increase. Samples prepared with a higher concentration of thrombin or fibrinogen exhibited an increase in rigidity in the first phase, but this behaviour is not observed after the first phase. Consistent with previous research, it was determined that the clotting time of fibrin decreases with increasing concentration of thrombin or fibrinogen. This effect is also observed when salt is added to the Tris-EDTA buffer. The addition of salt was also found to have an effect on the long-term stability of clots, as the rigidity of samples prepared with salt experienced a sharp decline in the third phase. This can be related to the structure of fibrin, and the findings in this work can be used to help increase our understanding of how to make a perfect clot.

[telangiectase, patient, ssc, dissatisfaction]

A pilot study of body image dissatisfaction and the psychological impact of systemic sclerosis-related telangiectases.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the extent of body image dissatisfaction (BID) in patients with self-reported systemic sclerosis (SSc)-related telangiectases and to identify the demographic, psychological and disease-related correlates of BID within a cross-sectional study. METHODS: Patients with SSc were invited to participate in a questionnaire survey. Each completed the Adjusted Satisfaction with Appearance Scale (ASWAP), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and an open-ended telangiectases questionnaire. Thematic analysis was utilised to describe the qualitative data. RESULTS: 141 patients with SSc participated (83% female, 70% limited cutaneous SSc, median age 62 years). Telangiectases were reported by 113 (80%). ASWAP 'dissatisfaction with appearance' scores were significantly higher in those reporting telangiectases (p=0.02). Anxiety and depression scores were similar in those with and without telangiectases. Those reporting telangiectases were more likely to be anticentromere positive (40% vs. 18%, p=0.02) and to have a history of severe digital ischaemia (38% vs. 18%, p=0.04) than those not. Qualitative analysis revealed four themes: changes in behaviour as a result of telangiectases, public and private self-image, negative emotional impact of telangiectases and appreciation of life. CONCLUSIONS: BID, as measured by the ASWAP 'dissatisfaction with appearance' subscale, was significantly higher in patients with telangiectases. Telangiectases were associated with anticentromere positivity and digital ischaemia, lending further support for telangiectases as a potential marker for vascular involvement. Qualitative analysis provided new insights into the thoughts and feelings of patients with telangiectases. Our findings highlight the impact of telangiectases and the need to address and manage related concerns.

Using the WHOQOL-BREF in persons with dementia: a validation study.
Increasing evidence suggests that persons with early dementia can give reliable and valid assessments about their own quality of life (QOL), thereby improving accuracy, and reducing the need for proxy informants. The objective of this study was to examine QOL in persons diagnosed with dementia (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder-IV) using a battery of subjective assessments including the new World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF). Persons with mild-to-moderate dementia (n=104) were recruited and interviewed at 6 Spanish centers to obtain sociodemographic information, health perceptions, depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale 15-item version), functional ability (Barthel Index), generic QOL (WHOQOL-BREF), and specific QOL (DEMQOL-28). Analysis was performed using classical psychometric methods. Internal consistency reliability for the WHOQOL-BREF domains ranged from moderate (0.54 for social) to good (0.79 for psychological). Test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation) ranged from moderate (0.51 for psychological) to good (0.70 for physical). Associations were confirmed between WHOQOL-BREF domains with DEMQOL-28, Geriatric Depression Scale 15-item version, and Barthel dimensions. With regard to contrasting groups' differences, WHOQOL-BREF scores significantly differentiated between healthy and unhealthy and depressed and nondepressed participants. This study is the first to report on the use of the WHOQOL-BREF in persons with mild-to-moderate dementia. These results indicate that it is a useful tool in assessing these groups, as it includes important dimensions commonly omitted from other dementia measures.

Influence of food on the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole.
Eight healthy adults were given single oral doses of ketoconazole (200, 400, 600, and 800 mg) in the fasting state and with a standard breakfast at weekly intervals according to a balanced block design. Concentrations in serum were measured up to 32 h after the dose. Food did not reduce ketoconazole absorption or significantly alter peak ketoconazole concentrations in serum, though there was a food-related delay in achieving peak concentrations. At the 400- and 600-mg doses, food appeared to enhance absorption, but this effect was not seen at the 800-mg dose. With an increase in dose, the half-life and area under the serum concentration-time curve increased disproportionately, suggesting that the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole may be dose dependent. Up to the 800-mg dose, the elimination of ketoconazole did not appear to be saturable. Administration of the drug with food is unlikely to be a cause of therapeutic failure.

The Embeddedness of Ethical Banking in the UK
AbstractUniversity of ManchesterDaniel Tischer, PhDThe Embeddedness of Ethical Banking in the UK2012Following the financial crisis that began in 2007, various groups and individuals demanded an ecologically diverse banking sector to help spread risk in the banking industry and to more effectively cater to customer needs. To date, however, measures to change retail banking have been limited to modest structural and incentive adjustments to boost competition and modify the banking culture which prompts an investigation about the nature of the ethical banking sector and its ability to grow and thrive. The lack of progress in reforming banking in the UK raises questions of whether and how we could encourage and sustain ethical, social and non-profit alternatives to current high street banks. Because prior academic research in ethical has been limited, the research aims to fill gaps with regards to understanding the network established between ethical banks their business models and to identify the type of intervention needed to promote ethical banking as an alternative to established mainstream retail banking.The research presented in this thesis investigates how the ethical banking sector is embedded in the UK financial services industry and draws out political-economic dynamics that facilitate as well as hinder the development of the sector. To this end, the thesis develops a conceptual framework that draws on literatures on industrial districts and embeddedness. The thesis also models and analyses the ethical banking network using social network analysis, before developing an understanding of ethical banks’ business models and how the sector is organised within the banking industry. Data on the banks’ relationships with other organisations were gathered through questionnaires, and interviews were conducted with respondent firms to explore ethical banking as a sector from the perspective of ethical banks themselves. In addition, company, industry and legislative publications have been analysed to add context and validate findings.At the broadest level, the results draw a picture of ethical banking as a diverse but disorganised subsector which is dominated by two players and lacks prospects to develop into an alternative banking sector that could compete with the full banking services offered by high street competition. Only if the sector manages to reorganise itself internally with support from external players could it form a more coherent and centralised subsector with a clear and shared understanding as to what its ambitions are. Thus the research highlights the potential of ethical banking which is expanding rapidly, but, at the same time, the research also raises the difficulties in developing ethical banking as a sector which retains its distinctiveness   from high street banks. In sum, the research findings are in line with current ambitions to develop and promote a more diverse and sustainable UK banking industry: ethical banks should receive more attention from policy makers as they are a set of diverse actors that has grown significantly since the beginning of the financial crisis and, could if strengthened, contribute to developing a stronger retail banking sector more responsive to customer needs. Government efforts to reorganise banking should include developing ethical banking as an alternative to Plc retail banks which would change competition by increasing consumer choice instead of creating yet more large scale banks.

An analysis of the control hierarchy modeling of the CMS detector control system
The supervisory level of the Detector Control System (DCS) of the CMS experiment is implemented using Finite State Machines (FSM), which model the behaviours and control the operations of all the sub-detectors and support services. The FSM tree of the whole CMS experiment consists of more than 30.000 nodes. An analysis of a system of such size is a complex task but is a crucial step towards the improvement of the overall performance of the FSM system. This paper presents the analysis of the CMS FSM system using the micro Common Representation Language 2 (mcrl2) methodology. Individual mCRL2 models are obtained for the FSM systems of the CMS sub-detectors using the ASF+SDF automated translation tool. Different mCRL2 operations are applied to the mCRL2 models. A mCRL2 simulation tool is used to closer examine the system. Visualization of a system based on the exploration of its state space is enabled with a mCRL2 tool. Requirements such as command and state propagation are expressed using modal mu-calculus and checked using a model checking algorithm. For checking local requirements such as endless loop freedom, the Bounded Model Checking technique is applied. This paper discusses these analysis techniques and presents the results of their application on the CMS FSM system.

Succinic acid fermentation in a stationary-basket bioreactor with a packed bed of immobilized Actinobacillus succinogenes: 1. Influence of internal diffusion on substrate mass transfer and consumption rate
This paper is dedicated to the study on external and internal mass transfers of glucose for succinic fermentation under substrate and product inhibitions using a bioreactor with a stationary basket bed of immobilized Actinobacillus succinogenes cells. By means of the substrate mass balance for a single particle of biocatalysts, considering the Jerusalimsky kinetic model including both inhibitory effects, specific mathematical expressions have been developed for describing the profiles of the substrate concentrations and mass flows in the outer and inner regions of biocatalyst particles, as well as for estimating the influence of internal diffusion on glucose consumption rate. The results indicated that very low values of internal mass flow could be reached in the particles center. The corresponding region was considered biologically inactive, with its extent varying from 0.24\% to 44\% from the overall volume of each biocatalyst. By immobilization of bacterial cells and use of a basket bed, the rate of glucose consumption is reduced up to 200 times compared with the succinic fermentation system containing free cells.

The effects of hydrophobic modifications on the interaction of human hair with water
Human hair, like other α-keratinous fibres, is a highly complex biomaterial. For the analysis of its mechanical properties it is, however, well described by a two-phase structure, which contains as morphological components the highly-ordered, crystalline intermediate filaments (IFs) and the less-ordered, amorphous matrix. The presence of elastic IFs alongside the viscous matrix, results in the viscoelastic properties exhibited by human hair.
Previous studies have shown that wool has a higher glass transition temperature, Tg, than human hair despite a higher content of the hydrophobic, high glycine-tyrosine (HGT) proteins contained within the matrix. On this basis the ‘internal plasticization hypothesis’ was developed, stating that the HGT-proteins in hair have a specific plasticization effect in the matrix. To investigate this hypothesis, hydrophobic modifications of the matrix proteins have been carried out and their effects on the thermal properties of the hair analysed. During the first stage of the investigations it was shown that, hydrophobic modifications by esterification lead to substantial changes of the humidity-dependent glass transition of human hair.
The disulphide linkages, which are predominantly located in the matrix, play an important role for the stability of a hair fibre. In this work, the disulphide linkages have been reduced and subsequently methylated and both the thermal and mechanical properties analysed. First results are reported for this second stage of the investigations.

Metabotropic glutamate mGlu5 receptor-mediated modulation of the ventral striopallidal GABA pathway in rats. Interactions with adenosine A(2A) and dopamine D(2) receptors.
Interactions between subtypes of dopamine, glutamate and adenosine receptors seem to play an important integrative role in the function of striatal gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic efferent neurons. Recent behavioral and biochemical studies suggest the existence of specific interactions between adenosine A2A receptors (A(2A)R), dopamine D2 receptors (D2R) and the group I metabotropic mGlu5 receptors (mGlu5R) in the dorsal striatum. The dual-probe approach in vivo microdialysis technique in freely moving rats was used to study the role of mGlu5R/A2AR/D2R interactions in the modulation of the ventral striopallidal GABA pathway. Perfusion of a selective mGlu5R agonist (CHPG) in the nucleus accumbens facilitated GABA release in the ipsilateral ventral pallidum. This effect was strongly potentiated by co-perfusion with the A2AR agonist CGS 21680. Co-perfusion with the D2R agonist quinpirole counteracted the increase in pallidal GABA levels induced by CGS 21680 and by CGS 21680 plus CHPG. These results demonstrate that mGlu5R/A2AR/D2R interactions play an important modulatory role in the function of the ventral striopallidal GABA pathway, which might have implications for the treatment of schizophrenia and drug addiction.

The impact of an improvised social work method in a school: aspirations, encouragement, realism and openness
A high school in the English West Midlands reduces annual school exclusions from 251 to 6 in three years. A social worker is employed by the school to join the student support services. A new method of brief intervention is introduced by the social worker based on 'aspirations, encouragement, realism and openness' (AERO), summarised by one teacher as helping a conversation develop in which the young people can discuss problems that they would otherwise find difficult. All of this is established with no special pilot project status or resources.<p></p>This article considers the relationship between these factors and evaluates the impact of the AERO method through interviews with key participants — 12 students currently in school and one parent, all of whom had direct experience of the method, and six professionals who experienced the impact of the model. The findings suggest that the philosophy of social inclusion introduced by a new head teacher is sustained by a systematic approach to providing social and personal support to students, and by the use of an effective and efficient practice method. The article discusses the possibilities of transferring the lessons from this study and also the possible limitations of the social work method and the study itself.

OX40 ligation on activated T cells enhances the control of Cryptococcus neoformans and reduces pulmonary eosinophilia.
Pulmonary eosinophilia induced in C57BL/6 mice after Cryptococcus neoformans infection is driven by CD4(+) Th2 cells. The immunological mechanisms that protect against eosinophilia are not fully understood. Interaction of OX40 (CD134) and its ligand, OX40L, has been implicated in T cell activation and cell migration. Unlike CD28, OX40 is only expressed on T cells 1-2 days after Ag activation. Manipulation of this pathway would therefore target recently activated T cells, leaving the naive repertoire unaffected. In this study, we show that engagement of OX40 by an OX40L:Ig fusion protein drives IFN-gamma production by CD4(+) T cells and reduces eosinophilia and C. neoformans burden in the lung. Using gene-depleted mice, we show that reduction of eosinophilia and pathogen burden requires IL-12 and/or IFN-gamma. C. neoformans infection itself only partially induces OX40L expression by APCs. Provision of exogenous OX40L reveals a critical role of this pathway in the prevention of C. neoformans-induced eosinophilia.

Long-term survival and risk stratification in patients with angina at rest undergoing medical treatment.
In order to determine those factors which influence long-term prognosis in patients with angina at rest associated with transient ST-segment changes, 217 patients undergoing medical treatment were followed for a mean of 39 months. All patients underwent coronary arteriography. Univariate analysis identified 12 variables significantly related to prognosis. These were disease of the left main coronary artery; the number of diseased vessels; left ventricular end-diastolic pressure; ejection fraction; baseline electrocardiogram; presence of prior myocardial infarction; ST-segment depression and ventricular arrhythmias during pain; disease of the proximal anterior descending coronary artery; crescendo angina; hypertension; and age. Use of the Cox regression model for survival analysis revealed only 3 variables which were independent predictors of prognosis. They were disease of the left main coronary artery; the number of diseased vessels and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. The model allowed stratification of patients into 3 groups. Survival at 3 years was 98% in the low risk group; 82% in the intermediate risk group; and 58% in the high risk group. These data indicate that disease of the left main coronary artery, the number of diseased vessels and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure are the independent predictors of prognosis in angina at rest. These variables may allow stratification of patients into groups having different long-term survivals.

Enhanced phagocytosis and intracellular killing of Candida albicans by GM-CSF-activated human neutrophils.
Little is known about effector cell modulation regarding phagocytosis and candidacidal activities of human neutrophils in response to granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). In neutrophil monolayer assays, pre-treatment of cells with ultrapure GM-CSF at 40 Units ml-1 for a minimum of 1 h showed a significant enhancement of phagocytosis of Candida albicans (phagocytic index of 2.6 compared with 1.6 for unactivated neutrophils) after a 20 min ingestion period (P < 0.001). By counting viable colonies 50% of intracellular yeast cells were killed by non-activated neutrophils following internalization for 2 h. Neutrophils activated for 2 h with 40 Units ml-1 of GM-CSF killed 90% of intracellular blastoconidia (P < 0.02). These results demonstrate that in in vitro assays GM-CSF enhances phagocytosis and intracellular killing of C. albicans.

A phase I study of Vandetanib in combination with vinorelbine/cisplatin or gemcitabine/cisplatin as first-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
INTRODUCTION: Vandetanib is a once-daily oral agent that selectively inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, and RET (REarranged during Transfection) signaling. METHODS: This Phase I study investigated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of vandetanib when administered with either gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) or vinorelbine plus cisplatin (VC) in patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. RESULTS: Seventeen patients received vandetanib 100 mg/d plus VC (n = 9) or GC (n = 8). Three dose-limiting toxicities were reported in each treatment group: vandetanib + VC (pulmonary artery thrombosis and asymptomatic QTc prolongation n = 2); vandetanib + GC (peripheral ischemia due to arterial occlusion, pulmonary embolism, and limb venous thrombosis). The protocol definition of a tolerable dose was not met, and no patients were recruited to receive vandetanib 300 mg plus VC or GC. There was no apparent pharmacokinetic interaction between vandetanib and vinorelbine or gemcitabine, but there was an approximate 30% increase in the exposure to cisplatin, which may be due to accumulation of total platinum and/or an interaction with vandetanib. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, in patients with previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer, vandetanib 100 mg/d in combination with either VC or GC was not tolerated.

Electrical properties of pulsed UV laser irradiated amorphous carbon
<p>Amorphous carbon films containing no hydrogen were irradiated with a pulsed UV laser in vacuum. Raman spectroscopy indicates an increase in the quantity of sp(2) clustering with the highest laser energy density and a commensurate reduction in resistivity. The reduction of resistivity is explained to be associated with thermally induced graphitization of amorphous carbon films. The high field transport is consistent with a Poole-Frenkel type transport mechanism via neutral trapping centers related to sp(2) sites which are activated under high fields. Decreasing the resistivity is an important feature for use of carbon as an electronic material. (C) 2008 American Institute of Physics.</p>

Selective 5-hydroxytryptamine antagonism: a role in irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia?
BACKGROUND: Abnormalities of gut motility and visceral pain perception are both thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome and may be susceptible to modulation by drugs affecting the various 5-HT receptor subtypes. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic potential of a 5-HT3 antagonist in irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: Fifty patients with irritable bowel syndrome were treated with ondansetron, a highly selective 5-HT3 antagonist, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study. In addition to assessing its effect on the classical symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (abdominal pain, distension and disordered bowel habit) its effect on symptoms often seen in irritable bowel syndrome, but more commonly associated with functional dyspepsia, was also examined. RESULTS: Ondansetron reduced bowel frequency (P = 0.035) and improved stool consistency (P = 0.002) in diarrhoea predominant irritable bowel syndrome and did not cause a deterioration of bowel habit in constipation predominant subjects. No statistically significant improvement was seen for abdominal pain or distension, although those patients who did respond were approximately twice as likely to be taking ondansetron than placebo. It was also found that ondansetron significantly improved the upper gastrointestinal symptoms of post-prandial epigastric discomfort (P = 0.008), flatulence (P = 0.022) and heartburn (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The results of this study justify evaluation of the therapeutic potential of selective 5-HT antagonists in both functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome.

RESULTS: A training set, including sera from 139 patients with early-stage ovarian cancer, 149 patients with late-stage ovarian cancer, and 1,102 healthy women, was analyzed with MMC algorithm and cross validation to identify an optimal biomarker panel discriminating early-stage cancer from healthy controls. The four-biomarker panel providing the highest diagnostic power of 86% sensitivity (SN) for early-stage and 93% SN for late-stage ovarian cancer at 98% specificity (SP) was comprised of CA-125, HE4, CEA, and VCAM-1. This model was applied to an independent blinded validation set consisting of sera from 44 patients with early-stage ovarian cancer, 124 patients with late-stage ovarian cancer, and 929 healthy women, providing unbiased estimates of 86% SN for stage I and II and 95% SN for stage III and IV disease at 98% SP. This panel was selective for ovarian cancer showing SN of 33% for benign pelvic disease, SN of 6% for breast cancer, SN of 0% for colorectal cancer, and SN of 36% for lung cancer. CONCLUSION: A panel of CA-125, HE4, CEA, and VCAM-1, after additional validation, could serve as an initial stage in a screening strategy for epithelial ovarian cancer.

[theory, stress, couple]

Meso-scale features and couple stresses in fracture process zone
Generalized continuum theories such as couple stress theory have the potential to improve our understanding of material deformation and fracture behaviour in areas where classical continuum theory breaks down at, for example, the length scale of meso-scale features within the fracture process zone. The couple stress theory considers not only relative displacements between these features but also relative rotations, introducing a natural length scale. A model has been developed of a low stiffness matrix containing suitably situated high stiffness particles to simulate the presence of defects at the meso-scale. This has been used to assess the descriptive potential of a novel consistent couple stress theory. The model has been subjected to a set of displacement fields selected to produce strain energies with varying contributions from the coupled stresses. The results demonstrate the effect of particle size to spacing ratio on the elastic energies. These can be used to evaluate the couple stress constant as well as validate the constant experimentally for specific materials.

[acetaldehyde, xylitol, candida, production, ethanol]

Xylitol inhibits carcinogenic acetaldehyde production by Candida species.
Acetaldehyde is a highly toxic and mutagenic product of alcohol fermentation and metabolism which has been classified as a Class I carcinogen for humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organisation (WHO). Many Candida species representing oral microbiota have been shown to be capable of marked acetaldehyde production. The aim of our study was to examine the effects of various sugar alcohols and sugars on microbial acetaldehyde production. The study hypothesis was that xylitol could reduce the amount of acetaldehyde produced by Candida. Laboratory and clinical isolates of seven Candida species were selected for the study. The isolates were incubated in 12 mM ethanol and 110 mM glucose, fructose or xylitol at 37°C for 30 min and the formed acetaldehyde was measured by gas chromatography. Xylitol significantly (p < 0.0001) reduced the amount of acetaldehyde produced from ethanol by 84%. In the absence of xylitol, the mean acetaldehyde production in ethanol incubation was 220.5 μM and in ethanol-xylitol incubation 32.8 μM. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme activity. Coincubation with glucose reduced the amount of produced acetaldehyde by 23% and coincubation with fructose by 29%. At concentrations that are representative of those found in the oral cavity during the intake of proprietary xylitol products, xylitol was found to reduce the production of carcinogenic acetaldehyde from ethanol by Candida below the mutagenic level of 40-100 μM.

Treatment of limited small cell lung cancer: an old or new challenge?
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review highlights how progress has been made in treating limited small cell lung cancer and outlines current challenges to overcome for improved cure rates. RECENT FINDINGS: There is a rationale for the tumour, node, metastasis staging system to replace the current convention of limited versus extensive stage. Positron emission tomography may aid in staging but prospective validation in larger series of patients is needed. Cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy has yet to be superseded by either newer cytotoxic drugs or targeted agents. More progress has been made for radiotherapy but questions of optimal dose, schedule, timing and treatment volume remain unanswered. SUMMARY: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is associated with a one in four chance of cure. Two ongoing phase III trials have been designed to address the optimal radiotherapy regimen to combine with cisplatin and etoposide. Close collaboration between radiation and medical oncologists is needed to make further progress and to improve patient access to curative intent concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimens.

[cell, pylori, tumour, tumour-infiltrating, response, gastric, lymphoma]

Helicobacter pylori-specific tumour-infiltrating T cells provide contact dependent help for the growth of malignant B cells in low-grade gastric lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue.
Previous studies have shown that tumour cells from low-grade B-cell gastric lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type proliferate in vitro in response to heat-killed whole cell preparations of Helicobacter pylori, but only in the presence of tumour-infiltrating T cells. This response is strain-specific in that the tumours studied responded optimally to different strains of H. pylori. It was unclear from these studies, however, whether the ability to recognize the specific stimulating strains of H. pylori was a property of the tumour cells or the tumour-infiltrating T cells. This study shows that whereas the tumour cells do not respond to H. pylori, both freshly isolated tumour-infiltrating T cells and a T cell line derived from these cells proliferate in response to stimulating strains of H. pylori. T cells from the spleen of one of the patients do not share this property. These results suggest that B-cell proliferation in cases of low-grade gastric lymphoma of MALT type in vitro in response to H. pylori is due to recognition of H. pylori by tumour-infiltrating T cells, which in turn provide help for tumour cell proliferation. The observations provide an explanation for properties of gastric MALT-type lymphoma, such as regression following eradication of H. pylori and the tendency of the tumour to remain localized to the primary site.

[il-2, methylation, hospital, asthma, child, admission, site1, exacerbation, age]

Methylation of IL-2 promoter at birth alters the risk of asthma exacerbations during childhood.
BACKGROUND: Epigenetic modifications may have a role in asthma susceptibility. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether epigenetic modification at birth of a CpG site necessary for the regulation of IL-2 transcription (IL-2 Site1) is associated with the development of asthma during childhood. METHODS: Methylation of IL-2 Site1 was assessed in cord blood from 303 children (225 with atopic mothers); as controls, we measured methylation of a site not important in the transcription of IL-2 (IL-2 Site7) and methylation of the LINE-1 repetitive element. Children were followed to the age of 8 years. Information on severe asthma exacerbations and hospital admissions was collected from child's primary care medical record. To account for potential confounding by bronchiolitis, we used exacerbations/hospitalizations after age 1 year as primary outcomes. RESULTS: There were 49 severe exacerbations amongst 33 children, and 22 hospital admissions amongst 11 children. The risk of asthma exacerbation increased 1.07-fold (95% CI 1.01-1.14, P = 0.03) and the risk of hospital admission increased 1.12-fold (95% CI 1.04-1.20, P = 0.002) for each one per cent increase in IL-2 Site1 methylation. Children who were admitted to hospital at any time-point had significantly higher IL-2 Site1 methylation than children not admitted to hospital (P = 0.007). There was a significant interaction between age at exacerbation (P = 0.03) or hospital admission (P = 0.02) and methylation, with the effect of methylation increasing with increasing age. Methylation of the control IL-2 Site7 or LINE-1 was not a significant predictor of asthma exacerbations/hospital admission, and we found no association between IL-2 Site1 methylation and hospital admissions for other reasons (0.99 0.92-1.06). Cord blood mononuclear cell phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphoproliferative responses decreased significantly with increasing IL-2 Site1 methylation (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing methylation in cord blood of a functional CpG site in the IL-2 promoter is associated with increased likelihood of severe asthma exacerbations and hospital admissions for asthma/wheeze between ages of 2 and 8 years.

Trial participants’ experiences of early enhanced speech and language therapy after stroke compared with employed visitor support: a qualitative study nested within a randomized controlled trial
Objectives: To explore trial participants’ experiences of the process and outcomes of early, enhanced speech and language therapy after stroke with support from an employed visitor.Design: Qualitative study nested within a randomized controlled trial.Participants: Twney-two people who, after stroke, had a diagnosis of aphasia (12), dysarthria (5) or both (5) and who participated in the ACT NoW study.Setting: Eight English NHS usual care settings.Method: Individual interviews. Thematic content analysis assisted by a bespoke data transformation protocol for incorporating non-verbal and semantically ambiguous data.Results: Participants highly regarded regular and sustained contact with someone outside of immediate family/friends who engaged them in deliberate activities/communication in the early months after stroke. Participants identified differences in the process of intervention between speech and language therapists and employed visitors. But no major discriminations were made between the impact or value of this contact according to whether provided by a speech and language therapist or employed visitor. Participant-defined criteria for effectiveness of contact included: impact on mood and confidence, self-recognition of progress and the meeting of individual needs.Conclusions: As in the randomized controlled trial, participants reported no evidence of added benefit of early communication therapy beyond that from attention control. The findings do not imply that regular contact with any non-professional can have beneficial effects for someone with aphasia or dysarthria in the early weeks following a stroke. The study points to specific conditions that would have to be met for contact to have a positive effect.

Suicide Within Two Weeks of Discharge From Psychiatric Inpatient Care: A Case-Control Study.
OBJECTIVE Suicide risk after discharge from psychiatric inpatient care is high, particularly in the first few weeks. The aim of the study was to identify risk factors and protective factors (that is, factors associated with a reduced risk of suicide), including variation in health care received, for suicide among patients in the two-week postdischarge period. METHODS This was a national population-based retrospective case-control study of 100 psychiatric patients in England (2004-2006), age 18-65, who died by suicide within two weeks of hospital discharge. These patients were matched on discharge date with 100 living control group patients. RESULTS Fifty-five percent of suicides occurred within a week of discharge, 49% of whom died before their first follow-up appointment. Conditional logistic regression analyses indicated that recent adverse life events and a short (less than one week) final admission were independently associated with postdischarge suicide, as were older age and comorbid psychiatric disorders. Receiving enhanced aftercare (under the Care Programme Approach) was protective of suicide. CONCLUSIONS Discharged patients viewed as being at high risk of suicide require immediate community follow-up. Mental health services should be mindful of discharging patients after a short admission. The potential role of detrimental life experiences indicates that mental health clinicians need to be aware of the circumstances into which patients are being discharged. Use of enhanced levels of care, such as that offered by the Care Programme Approach, may play a strong role in preventing suicide within two weeks of discharge.

[kd, cell, lymphoid, tissue, normal, mc, keloid]

Site-specific immunophenotyping of keloid disease demonstrates immune upregulation and the presence of lymphoid aggregates.
BACKGROUND: Keloid disease (KD) is a common fibroproliferative disorder of unknown aetiology. T cells and macrophages are increased in KD and are thought to contribute to its pathogenesis. However, while a link between inflammation and fibrotic disorders is well known for other disorders, it remains undetermined in KD. OBJECTIVES: Systematically to immunophenotype the inflammatory infiltrate of KD in situ in a site-specific manner, and to compare this with normal skin and scar tissue. METHODS: Sixty-eight keloid cases were screened for the presence of all three (intralesional, perilesional and extralesional) keloid-associated specific tissue sites. Subsequently, a complete set of 25 keloid biopsies (from different patients) was compared with normal skin (n = 11) and normal scar (n = 11) samples and subjected to systematic, site-specific quantitative immunohistomorphometry and histochemistry, using a range of immunological markers of B cells, T cells, macrophages, mast cells (MCs) and Langerhans cells. RESULTS: T cells, B cells, degranulated and mature MCs (coexpressing OX40 ligand) and alternative macrophages (M2) were all significantly increased in intralesional and perilesional KD sites compared with normal skin and scar tissue (P < 0·05). Additionally, 10 of 68 KD cases (15%) showed the presence of distinctive lymphoid aggregates, which resembled mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). CONCLUSIONS: The increased number and activity of MCs and M2 may implicate inflammation in the fibrotic process in KD. The distinct KD-associated lymphoid aggregate resembles MALT, for which we propose the term 'keloid-associated lymphoid tissue' (KALT). It may perpetuate inflammatory stimuli that promote KD growth. KALT, MCs and M2 are promising novel targets for future KD therapy.

Securing Deployed RFIDs by Randomizing the Modulation and the Channel
RFID cards are widely used today in sensitive applications such as access control, payment systems, and asset tracking. Past work shows that an eavesdropper snooping on the communication between a card and its legitimate reader can break their cryptographic protocol and obtain their secret keys. One solution for this problem is to install stronger cryptographic protocols on the cards. However, RFIDs' size, power, and cost limitations do not allow for conventional cryptographic protocols. Further, installing new protocols requires revoking billions of cards in consumers  hands and facilities worldwide, which is costly and impractical. In this paper, we ask whether one can secure RFIDs from such attacks without revoking or changing the insecure cards. We propose LocRF, a solution that changes the signal used to read the RFID cards but does not require any changes to the cards themselves. LocRF introduces a new approach that randomizes the modulation of the RFID signal as well as the wireless channel. This design protects RFIDs from eavesdroppers even if they use multi-antenna MIMO receivers. We built a prototype of LocRF on software-defined radios and used it to secure the communication of off-the-shelf cards. Both our analysis and empirical evaluation demonstrate theeffectiveness of LocRF.

ESCMID* guideline for the diagnosis and management of Candida diseases 2012: patients with HIV infection or AIDS.
Mucosal candidiasis is frequent in immunocompromised HIV-infected highly active antiretroviral (HAART) naive patients or those who have failed therapy. Mucosal candidiasis is a marker of progressive immune deficiency. Because of the frequently marked and prompt immune reconstitution induced by HAART, there is no recommendation for primary antifungal prophylaxis of mucosal candidiasis in the HIV setting in Europe, although it has been evidenced as effective in the pre-HAART era. Fluconazole remains the first line of therapy for both oropharyngeal candidiasis and oesophageal candidiasis and should be preferred to itraconazole oral solution (or capsules when not available) due to fewer side effects. For patients who still present with fluconazole-refractory mucosal candidiasis, oral treatment with any other azole should be preferred based on precise Candida species identification and susceptibility testing results in addition to the optimization of HAART when feasible. For vaginal candidiasis, topical therapy is preferred.

Molecular dynamics study of anhydrous lamellar structures of synthetic glycolipids: effects of chain branching and disaccharide headgroup.
Glycolipids form materials of considerable potential for a wide range of surfactant and thin film applications. Understanding the effect of glycolipid covalent structure on the properties of their thermotropic and lyotropic assemblies is a key step toward rational design of new glycolipid-based materials. Here, we perform molecular dynamics simulations of anhydrous bilayers of dodecyl β-maltoside, dodecyl β-cellobioside, dodecyl β-isomaltoside, and a C(12)C(10) branched β-maltoside. Specifically, we examine the consequences of chain branching and headgroup identity on the structure and dynamics of the lamellar assemblies. Chain branching of the glycolipid leads to measurable differences in the dimensions and interactions of the lamellar assembly, as well as a more fluid-like hydrophobic chain region. Substitution of the maltosyl headgroup of βMal-C(12) by an isomaltosyl moiety leads to a significant decrease in bilayer spacing as well as a markedly altered pattern of inter-headgroup hydrogen bonding. The distinctive simulated structures of the two regioisomers provide insight into the difference of ∼90 °C in their observed clearing temperatures. For all four simulated glycolipid systems, with the exception of the sn-2 chain of the branched maltoside, the alkyl chains are ordered and exhibit a distinct tilt, consistent with recent crystallographic analysis of a branched chain Guerbet glycoside. These insights into structure-property relationships from simulation provide an important molecular basis for future design of synthetic glycolipid materials.

Stark shifts in EL have been observed up to 0.4 meV as a function of forward injection current, and around 0.7 meV by applying an electric field of 36 kV cm(-1) across the QDs. The independent control of the QD emission energy is an important step towards electrically tuning the coupling between QDs and cavities, and generating entangled-photon sources.</p>

[variant, locus, gene, trait, human, variation, genetic, study, polygenic]

Hundreds of variants clustered in genomic loci and biological pathways affect human height.
Most common human traits and diseases have a polygenic pattern of inheritance: DNA sequence variants at many genetic loci influence the phenotype. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified more than 600 variants associated with human traits, but these typically explain small fractions of phenotypic variation, raising questions about the use of further studies. Here, using 183,727 individuals, we show that hundreds of genetic variants, in at least 180 loci, influence adult height, a highly heritable and classic polygenic trait. The large number of loci reveals patterns with important implications for genetic studies of common human diseases and traits. First, the 180 loci are not random, but instead are enriched for genes that are connected in biological pathways (P = 0.016) and that underlie skeletal growth defects (P < 0.001). Second, the likely causal gene is often located near the most strongly associated variant: in 13 of 21 loci containing a known skeletal growth gene, that gene was closest to the associated variant. Third, at least 19 loci have multiple independently associated variants, suggesting that allelic heterogeneity is a frequent feature of polygenic traits, that comprehensive explorations of already-discovered loci should discover additional variants and that an appreciable fraction of associated loci may have been identified. Fourth, associated variants are enriched for likely functional effects on genes, being over-represented among variants that alter amino-acid structure of proteins and expression levels of nearby genes. Our data explain approximately 10% of the phenotypic variation in height, and we estimate that unidentified common variants of similar effect sizes would increase this figure to approximately 16% of phenotypic variation (approximately 20% of heritable variation). Although additional approaches are needed to dissect the genetic architecture of polygenic human traits fully, our findings indicate that GWA studies can identify large numbers of loci that implicate biologically relevant genes and pathways.

Accelerated Enzymatic Galactosylation of N-Acetylglucosaminolipids in Lipid Microdomains
A fluoro-tagged N-acetylglucosamine-capped glycolipid that can form lipid microdomains in fluid phospholipid bilayers has been shown to be enzymatically galactosylated by bovine β(1,4)-galactosyltransferase. MALDI MS, HPLC, and LC–MS revealed that the rate of enzymatic transformation was significantly enhanced by lipid clustering; at a 1% mol/mol loading, clustered glycolipids were galactosylated 9-fold faster than glycolipids dispersed across the bilayer surface. The transformation of the GlcNAc “glycocalyx” into a Gal(β1–4)GlcNAc “glycocalyx” relabeled these vesicles, making them susceptible to agglutination by Erythrina cristagalli lectin (ECL). The kinetic parameters for this transformation revealed a lower apparent Km when the substrate lipids were clustered, which is attributed to multivalent binding to an extended substrate cleft around the active site. These observations may have important implications where soluble enzymes act on substrates embedded within cellular lipid rafts.

[brain, stroke, inflammation, risk, systemic, animal]

Brain inflammation is induced by co-morbidities and risk factors for stroke.
Chronic systemic inflammatory conditions, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes and obesity are associated with increased risk of stroke, which suggests that systemic inflammation may contribute to the development of stroke in humans. The hypothesis that systemic inflammation may induce brain pathology can be tested in animals, and this was the key objective of the present study. First, we assessed inflammatory changes in the brain in rodent models of chronic, systemic inflammation. PET imaging revealed increased microglia activation in the brain of JCR-LA (corpulent) rats, which develop atherosclerosis and obesity, compared to the control lean strain. Immunostaining against Iba1 confirmed reactive microgliosis in these animals. An atherogenic diet in apolipoprotein E knock-out (ApoE(-/-)) mice induced microglial activation in the brain parenchyma within 8 weeks and increased expression of vascular adhesion molecules. Focal lipid deposition and neuroinflammation in periventricular and cortical areas and profound recruitment of activated myeloid phagocytes, T cells and granulocytes into the choroid plexus were also observed. In a small, preliminary study, patients at risk of stroke (multiple risk factors for stroke, with chronically elevated C-reactive protein, but negative MRI for brain pathology) exhibited increased inflammation in the brain, as indicated by PET imaging. These findings show that brain inflammation occurs in animals, and tentatively in humans, harbouring risk factors for stroke associated with elevated systemic inflammation. Thus a "primed" inflammatory environment in the brain may exist in individuals at risk of stroke and this can be adequately recapitulated in appropriate co-morbid animal models.

Persistent systemic inflammation is associated with poor clinical outcomes in COPD: a novel phenotype.
BACKGROUND: Because chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous condition, the identification of specific clinical phenotypes is key to developing more effective therapies. To explore if the persistence of systemic inflammation is associated with poor clinical outcomes in COPD we assessed patients recruited to the well-characterized ECLIPSE cohort (NCT00292552). METHODS AND FINDINGS: Six inflammatory biomarkers in peripheral blood (white blood cells (WBC) count and CRP, IL-6, IL-8, fibrinogen and TNF-α levels) were quantified in 1,755 COPD patients, 297 smokers with normal spirometry and 202 non-smoker controls that were followed-up for three years. We found that, at baseline, 30% of COPD patients did not show evidence of systemic inflammation whereas 16% had persistent systemic inflammation. Even though pulmonary abnormalities were similar in these two groups, persistently inflamed patients during follow-up had significantly increased all-cause mortality (13% vs. 2%, p<0.001) and exacerbation frequency (1.5 (1.5) vs. 0.9 (1.1) per year, p<0.001) compared to non-inflamed ones. As a descriptive study our results show associations but do not prove causality. Besides this, the inflammatory response is complex and we studied only a limited panel of biomarkers, albeit they are those investigated by the majority of previous studies and are often and easily measured in clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results identify a novel systemic inflammatory COPD phenotype that may be the target of specific research and treatment.

On-Line Partial Discharge Testing of In-Service Rotating Machines in Ex Hazardous Environments by Employment of Central Monitoring Solutions
Carrying out the on-line partial discharge (OLPD)testing of in-service high voltage (HV) rotating machines canbe an effective technique to understand any insulationdegradation mechanisms that may be present within the statorwindings. Interpretation of OLPD measurements performedon rotating machines can be difficult due to the presence ofnoise and interference from variable speed drives (VSD’s)and/or motor exciter systems. The new PD measurement andmonitoring techniques outlined in this paper are carried out atthe switchgear-end of the machine’s feeder cable, at distancesof up to 2km from the machine under test. It has been shownthat this remote monitoring technique eliminates much of thishigh-frequency interference which can be seen at themachines’ terminal box. This is due to the effect of the highvoltage power cable between the switchgear and the machine,with the cable acting as a low-pass filter, stripping out higherfrequency signals whilst retaining lower frequencies. Also,most importantly for operators with motors located within‘Ex’ hazardous gas zones such as in the oil & gas industry, theremote monitoring technique allows these motors to bemonitored without the need to enter the ‘Ex’ zone to installsensors or monitors. The authors present case studies from twooil & gas companies showing how the technique has been usedfor monitoring PD of in-service motors located in Ex zones.

Mixed Matrix Membranes of a Polymer of Intrinsic Microporosity with Crystalline Porous Solids
This work explores the fabrication and permeability testing of mixed matrix membranes (MMM) utilising a polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM-1) and various fillers. PIM-1 has been chosen for this work due to its high apparent surface area and high sorption of gases. PIM-1 also is a good candidate for gas sorption applications due to the film forming properties of the polymer. The fillers utilised in this work are Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and organic cages, which have been chosen due to the gas sorption properties they exhibit. The MOFs used are micro and nanoparticles of Zeolitic Imidazole Framework-8 (ZIF-8), copper based MOF HKUST-1 and chromium based MOF MIL-101. Micro particles of magnesium based MOF Mg-MOF-74 were also looked at as well as cage 3, nano cage 3 and reduced cage 3. Comparable surface areas of the MOFs compared to those quoted in the literature have been obtained. Successful PIM-1/Filler MMMs were synthesised utilising PIM-1 and the fillers outlined above with various loadings of filler. The highest loading achieved was with a 10:6.4 PIM-1/nanoZIF-8 ratio. All MMMs apart from PIM-1/Mg-MOF-74 MMM were homogenous on a macroscale with scanning electron microscopy proving the dispersion of fillers.  Gas transport properties of the MMMs were determined using predominantly a time lag method. PIM-1/ZIF-8 MMMs were also tested using a chromatographic method and using a gas sorption experiment. A range of gases were tested including CO2, N2, CH4, O2, He and H2.  Ideal selectivities were also calculated with focus on the gas pairs O2/N2, CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2.When comparing the two permeability methods using the PIM-1/nanoZIF-8 MMM, lower permeability results were found from the time lag method. This was concluded to be due to the aging effect brought about by the vacuum used in the time lag method. The chromatographic method produced positive results with high selectivities, breaking Robeson’s upper bound, for the gas pair O2/N2. All other fillers tested showed an increase in permeability and stable selectivity with an increase in the amount of filler. MIL-101 and Cage 3 were the most successful fillers with high permeabilities of 35600 and 37400 Barrer respectively, encroaching on that of PTMSP. Mg-MOF-74 and reduced cage 3 MMM however, had a detrimental effect on the permeability. Aging data was also investigated which showed that for the majority of MMM the permeability followed the trend of PIM-1. microHKUST-1 and cage 3 of 10:3 loading were shown to give promising results with 10000 and 14300 Barrer respectively compared to 7200 Barrer for PIM-1. Although a loss in permeability is seen, it is still above that of PIM-1 at the same point of aging. These results give a positive indication that MMMs have the potential to provide resistance against aging, a major problem in using high free volume polymers in industrial applications.

[employment, mother, maternal]

Trends and social divisions in maternal employment patterns following maternity leave in the UK
Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the social divisions in maternal employment patterns post-childbirth, recorded by earlier studies have persisted for a later cohort of mothers that had a pregnancy in the early 2000s, in the context of an expansion of childcare and other improvements in reconciliation measures. Design/methodology/approach – Longitudinal data from the UK's Millennium Cohort Study are analysed using logistic regression. Findings – It was found that mothers are more likely to be employed, and employed full-time, when their child is aged three if they were employed during the pregnancy and resumed employment within nine months of the birth. The mothers' occupational class, ethnicity, household composition and the working hours of a partner also have independent associations with the probability of maternal employment once the child is aged three. Research limitations/implications – The authors would expect these results to be modified – but not overturned – in a different national setting, for example where childcare services are more extensive or part-time employment is less common. Originality/value – These new longitudinal survey results for a recent cohort of mothers in the UK demonstrate that resumption of employment following maternity leave is pivotal for women's subsequent employment integration. Yet maternal employment trajectories remain shaped by social inequalities. Both results are important for informing debates about reconciliation policy for the pre-school years, including monitoring the impact of the recession on the employment integration of women following childbirth.

[psoriasis, locus, mhc, association, region, independent, major]

Conditional analysis identifies three novel major histocompatibility complex loci associated with psoriasis.
Psoriasis is a common, chronic, inflammatory skin disorder. A number of genetic loci have been shown to confer risk for psoriasis. Collectively, these offer an integrated model for the inherited basis for susceptibility to psoriasis that combines altered skin barrier function together with the dysregulation of innate immune pathogen sensing and adap-tive immunity. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) harbours the psoriasis susceptibility region which exhibits the largest effect size, driven in part by variation contained on the HLA-Cw*0602 allele. However, the resolution of the number and genomic location of potential independent risk loci are hampered by extensive linkage disequilibrium across the region. We leveraged the power of large psoriasis case and control data sets and the statistical approach of conditional analysis to identify potential further association signals distributed across the MHC. In addition to the major loci at HLA-C (P = 2.20 × 10(-236)), we observed and replicated four additional independent signals for disease association, three of which are novel. We detected evidence for association at SNPs rs2507971 (P = 6.73 × 10(-14)), rs9260313 (P = 7.93 × 10(-09)), rs66609536 (P = 3.54 × 10(-07)) and rs380924 (P = 6.24 × 10(-06)), located within the class I region of the MHC, with each observation replicated in an independent sample (P ≤ 0.01). The previously identified locus is close to MICA, the other three lie near MICB, HLA-A and HCG9 (a non-coding RNA gene). The identification of disease associations with both MICA and MICB is particularly intriguing, since each encodes an MHC class I-related protein with potent immunological function.

[datum, tool, workflow, analysis, taverna]

Performing statistical analyses on quantitative data in Taverna workflows: an example using R and maxdBrowse to identify differentially-expressed genes from microarray data.
BACKGROUND: There has been a dramatic increase in the amount of quantitative data derived from the measurement of changes at different levels of biological complexity during the post-genomic era. However, there are a number of issues associated with the use of computational tools employed for the analysis of such data. For example, computational tools such as R and MATLAB require prior knowledge of their programming languages in order to implement statistical analyses on data. Combining two or more tools in an analysis may also be problematic since data may have to be manually copied and pasted between separate user interfaces for each tool. Furthermore, this transfer of data may require a reconciliation step in order for there to be interoperability between computational tools. RESULTS: Developments in the Taverna workflow system have enabled pipelines to be constructed and enacted for generic and ad hoc analyses of quantitative data. Here, we present an example of such a workflow involving the statistical identification of differentially-expressed genes from microarray data followed by the annotation of their relationships to cellular processes. This workflow makes use of customised maxdBrowse web services, a system that allows Taverna to query and retrieve gene expression data from the maxdLoad2 microarray database. These data are then analysed by R to identify differentially-expressed genes using the Taverna RShell processor which has been developed for invoking this tool when it has been deployed as a service using the RServe library. In addition, the workflow uses Beanshell scripts to reconcile mismatches of data between services as well as to implement a form of user interaction for selecting subsets of microarray data for analysis as part of the workflow execution. A new plugin system in the Taverna software architecture is demonstrated by the use of renderers for displaying PDF files and CSV formatted data within the Taverna workbench. CONCLUSION: Taverna can be used by data analysis experts as a generic tool for composing ad hoc analyses of quantitative data by combining the use of scripts written in the R programming language with tools exposed as services in workflows. When these workflows are shared with colleagues and the wider scientific community, they provide an approach for other scientists wanting to use tools such as R without having to learn the corresponding programming language to analyse their own data.

[cell, rsv, lung, infection, ccl3]

The chemokine MIP1alpha/CCL3 determines pathology in primary RSV infection by regulating the balance of T cell populations in the murine lung.
BACKGROUND: CD8 T cells assist in the clearance of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection from the lungs. However, disease after RSV infection is in part caused by excessive T cell activity, and a balance is therefore needed between beneficial and harmful cellular immune responses. The chemokine CCL3 (MIP1alpha) is produced following RSV infection and is broadly chemotactic for both T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. We therefore investigated its role in RSV disease. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: CCL3 was produced biphasically, in both the early (day 1) and late (day 6-7) stages of infection. CCL3 depletion did not alter the recruitment of natural killer (NK) cells to the lungs during the early stage, but depletion did affect the later adaptive phase. While fewer T cells were recruited to the lungs of either CCL3 knockout or anti-CCL3 treated RSV infected mice, more RSV-specific pro-inflammatory T cells were recruited to the lung when CCL3 responses were impaired. This increase in RSV-specific pro-inflammatory T cells was accompanied by increased weight loss and illness after RSV infection. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: CCL3 regulates the balance of T cell populations in the lung and can alter the outcome of RSV infection. Understanding the role of inflammatory mediators in the recruitment of pathogenic T cells to the lungs may lead to novel methods to control RSV disease.

Patients’ reports or clinicians’ assessments – which are better for prognosticating? An observational study
Background The Prognosis in Palliative care Scale (PiPS) predicts survival in advanced cancer patients more accurately than a doctor's or a nurse's estimate. PiPS scores are derived using observer ratings of symptom severity and performance status. The purpose of this study was to determine whether patient-rated data would provide better prognostic estimates than clinician observer ratings. Patients and methods 1018 subjects with advanced cancer no longer undergoing tumour-directed therapy were recruited to a multi-centre study. Prognostic models were developed using observer ratings, patient ratings or a composite method that used patient ratings when available or else used observer ratings. The performance of the prognostic models was compared by determining the agreement between the models' predictions and the survival of study participants. Results All three approaches to model development resulted in prognostic scores that were able to differentiate between patients with a survival of ‘days’, ‘weeks’ or ‘months+’. However, the observer-rated models were significantly (p<0.05) more accurate than the patient-rated models. Conclusions A prognostic model derived using observer-rated data was more accurate at predicting survival than a similar model derived using patient self-report measures. This is clinically important because patient-rated data can be burdensome and difficult to obtain in patients with terminal illnesses.

[chaucer, creative, poet, work, value, poetic]

Guilt and Creativity in the Works of Geoffrey Chaucer
The late Middles Ages saw the development in Europe of increasingly complex, ambitious, and self-conscious forms of creative literature. In the works of poets such as Dante, Petrarch and Chaucer new models of authorship and poetic identity were being explored, new kinds of philosophical and aesthetic value attributed to literary discourse. But these creative developments also brought with them new dangers and tensions, a sense of guilt and uncertainty about the value of creative literature, especially in relation to the dominant religious values of late medieval culture.  In this thesis I explore how these doubts and tensions find expression in Chaucer’s poetry, not only as a negative, constraining influence, but also as something which contributes to the shape and meaning of poetry itself. I argue that as Chaucer develops his own expansive, questioning poetics in The House of Fame and The Canterbury Tales, he problematises the principle of allegory on which the legitimacy of literary discourse was primarily based in medieval culture and the final fragments of The Canterbury Tales see Chaucer struggling, increasingly, to reconcile the boldness and independence of his poetic vision with the demands of his faith. This struggle, which emerges most strongly and polemically in the final fragments, I argue, runs in subtle and creative forms throughout the whole of Chaucer’s work. By seeing Chaucer in this light as a poet not of fixed, but of conflicted and vacillating intentions – a poet productively caught drawn between ‘game’ and ‘earnest’, radical ironies and Boethian truths – I attempt to account, in a holistic manner, for the major dichotomies that characterise both his work and its critical reception.

Atrial Fibrillation in Heart Failure: An innocent bystander?
Heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) frequently coexist and each complicates the course of the other. The purpose of this review is to analyse the prognostic impact of AF in patients with HF and assess whether there is an advantage in targeting therapies towards the maintenance of sinus rhythm (SR) in this cohort of patients. The presence of AF in patients with HF has been reported to be independently associated with an increase in mortality in many studies and this increased risk is observed in those with both preserved and impaired LV systolic function. The optimal strategy for targeting AF in patients with HF is unclear but recent randomised controlled studies indicate no significant prognostic advantage associated with a rhythm control strategy as compared to a rate control strategy. A number of small studies have investigated the role of both cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) and AF catheter ablation for the maintenance of / conversion to SR in patients with HF with initial promising results although larger randomised controlled studies will need to be performed to define the role of these modalities in the treatment of this cohort and whether preliminary benefits observed in these studies translate to improvements in longer term prognosis. Finally, there has been a focus on modifying the arrythmogenic atrial substrate and neurohormonal milieu by pharmacological means in order to prevent AF although it remains to be seen whether this approach proves to be efficacious with improvements in clinically relevant outcomes.

The Shotgun Proteomic Study of the Human ThinPrep Cervical Smear Using iTRAQ Mass-Tagging and 2D LC-FT-Orbitrap-MS: The Detection of the Human Papillomavirus at the Protein Level.
The ThinPrep cervical smear is widely used in clinical practice for the cytological and molecular screening against abnormal cells and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Current advancements made to LC-MS proteomics include the use of stable isotope labeling for the in-depth analysis of proteins in complex clinical specimens. Such approaches have yet to be realized for ThinPrep clinical specimens. In this study, an LC-MS method based on isobaric (iTRAQ) labeling and high-resolution FT-Orbitrap mass spectrometry was used for the proteomic analysis of 23 human ThinPrep smear specimens. Tandem mass spectrometry analysis was performed with both nitrogen high collision dissociation (HCD MS/MS) and helium collision induced dissociation (CID MS/MS) peptide fragmentation modes. The analysis of three 8-plex sample sets yielded the identification of over 3200 unique proteins at FDR < 1%, of which over 2300 proteins were quantitatively profiled in at least one of the three experiments. The interindividual variability served to define the required sample size needed to identify significant protein expression differences. The degree of in-depth proteome coverage allowed the detection of 6 HPV-derived proteins including the high-risk HPV16 type in the specimens tested. The presence of the HPV strains of origin was also confirmed with PCR-hybridization molecular methods. This proof-of-principle study constitutes the first ever report on the nontargeted analysis of HPV proteins in human ThinPrep clinical specimens with high-resolution mass spectrometry. A further testament to the sensitivity and selectivity of the proposed study method was the confident detection of a significant number of phosphopeptides in these specimens.

Metabolomics to unveil and understand phenotypic diversity between pathogen populations
Leishmaniasis is a debilitating disease caused by the parasite Leishmania. There is extensive clinical polymorphism, including variable responsiveness to treatment. We study Leishmania donovani parasites isolated from visceral leishmaniasis patients in Nepal that responded differently to antimonial treatment due to differing intrinsic drug sensitivity of the parasites. Here, we present a proof-of-principle study in which we applied a metabolomics pipeline specifically developed for L. donovani to characterize the global metabolic differences between antimonial-sensitive and antimonial-resistant L. donovani isolates. Clones of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant parasite isolates from clinical samples were cultured in vitro and harvested for metabolomics analysis. The relative abundance of 340 metabolites was determined by {ZIC-HILIC} chromatography coupled to {LTQ-Orbitrap} mass spectrometry. Our measurements cover approximately 20\% of the predicted core metabolome of Leishmania and additionally detected a large number of lipids. Drug-sensitive and drug-resistant parasites showed distinct metabolic profiles, and unsupervised clustering and principal component analysis clearly distinguished the two phenotypes. For 100 metabolites, the detected intensity differed more than three-fold between the 2 phenotypes. Many of these were in specific areas of lipid metabolism, suggesting that the membrane composition of the drug-resistant parasites is extensively modified. Untargeted metabolomics has been applied on clinical Leishmania isolates to uncover major metabolic differences between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant isolates. The identified major differences provide novel insights into the mechanisms involved in resistance to antimonial drugs, and facilitate investigations using targeted approaches to unravel the key changes mediating drug resistance. ?? 2010 {t'Kindt} et al.

The structure of beliefs about the causes of heart attacks: A network analysis.
OBJECTIVES: To explore the structure of causal beliefs about heart attack, using network analysis, in particular to determine whether there is a consensual representation and, if so, which putative causes of heart attacks were perceived as being proximal or distal causes and which were perceived to mediate the effects of other causes. METHODS: A total of 107 adult respondents completed questionnaires, indicating the extent to which they perceived each of eight agents as causes of a heart attack, as well as whether they perceived that each of these eight causal agents, in turn, causally affects each of the other seven causal agents. RESULTS: A consensual representation was produced, indicating how these eight agents were perceived as causally relating to each other, and to heart attack. Three key features were evident. First, the type of work a person does was perceived to be a distal cause of heart attack, operating mainly through stress and high blood pressure. Second, the causal impact of stress on heart attack was not seen as mediated by behaviour, but mediated via blood pressure. Third, the causal impact of genes on heart attack was perceived as unmediated by behaviour or physiological processes. CONCLUSIONS: The general public appears to share a reasonably complex view of how different agents lead to heart attack. This complexity would not be elicited by standard methods, suggesting that the network analysis method may be usefully employed as either a process or an outcome measure in health-promotion research.

Pharmacological Treatment of Unipolar Depression.
Antidepressants were first developed serendipitously 60 years ago and gave rise to the monoamine hypothesis of depression and antidepressant action which has persisted in various forms ever since. Although we have made huge strides in our understanding of the pharmacology of antidepressants, and in the neuroscience of depression, our current antidepressants have changed little since the original drugs. In this chapter I first review some controversies in the use of antidepressant drugs including whether they actually work, and then go on to describe the current state of our clinical use of antidepressants, looking both at the principles and practice of treatment and reviewing the evidence for efficacy, tolerability and safety in acute and sequenced treatments. I finally briefly consider future directions and the aspiration of developing more effective antidepressants.

The genetic analysis of mechanisms of pathogen resistance in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has revealed a role for evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways that are required for innate immunity in a wide range of organisms, from worms to mammals. C. elegans represents one of the more simple host organisms in which mechanisms of host defense can be dissected, and the use of C. elegans presents the researcher with a wide array of genetic and genomic tools to probe the host-pathogen interface. The study of host defense mechanisms in C. elegans continues to provide an ancient evolutionary perspective on innate immunity, which may generate insights into the conserved processes in phylogenetically diverse host organisms, including humans.

An assessment of peptide enrichment methods employing mTRAQ quantification approaches.
The human plasma peptidome has potential in biomarker discovery not least because the plasma proteome is a challenging matrix due to its complexity and dynamic range. However, methods to significantly reduce the amount of protein present in plasma while retaining the less abundant peptides present in plasma samples has been a major issue. Here, we present a novel strategy which has been employed to assess the effectiveness of removing interfering proteins while retaining peptides of interest. To monitor peptide retention, a spiked in digested protein, in this case a synthetic QconCAT protein, was employed. This enabled a variety of target analytes (peptides) to be monitored for their retention in liquid phase, providing a broader picture of peptide loss from each method assessed. The incorporation of mTRAQ labeling allowed the presence of each peptide to be monitored, and accurate peptide losses to be determined in a Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) assay, thus, enabling an objective semiquantitative conclusion to be drawn regarding the suitability of each method for protein removal and peptide retention. We also assessed a range of methods for retaining nontryptic peptides in a plasma peptidomics workflow. From these data, we determined an optimal workflow for removing intact protein, while retaining peptides for MS-based analyses.

This course will focus on fundamental subjects in (deterministic) optimization, connected through the themes of convexity, geometric multipliers, and duality. The aim is to develop the core analytical and computational issues of continuous optimization, duality, and saddle point theory using a handful of unifying principles that can be easily visualized and readily understood. The mathematical theory of convex sets and functions will be central, and will allow an intuitive, highly visual, geometrical approach to the subject. This theory will be developed in detail and in parallel with the optimization topics. The first part of the course develops the analytical issues of convexity and duality. The second part is devoted to convex optimization algorithms, and their applications to a variety of large-scale optimization problems from resource allocation, machine learning, engineering design, and other areas.

Epigallocatechin-3-gallate and recombinant human activated protein C and the modulation of acute pancreatitis
Effective management of acute pancreatitis has for centuries eluded mankind. The disease has a wide spectrum of presentation; the milder form is usually a self limiting condition, whereas the severe form presents as a highly morbid and frequently lethal attack. The ability to predict disease progression on admission would aid in the comprehensive and multidisciplinary management of patients.The perfect predictor of disease progression has been an elusive factor hindering the management of the disease. On systematically reviewing literature and identifying appropriate biochemical markers in predicting progression of acute pancreatitis, the ideal predictor would be a combination of biochemical, clinical and contemporary organ dysfunction scoring systems. Early prediction of disease progression however, is important in the better management of the disease. The pathophysiological changes of acinar cell injury and death are the earliest events that occur in acute pancreatitis. Identification of potential pharmacological interventions offered through valuable insight in to experimental and clinical acute pancreatitis may lead on to the development of various natural and synthetic potential disease modifiers. Green Tea Extracts (GTE) consumed in many parts of the world has been examined as a potential therapeutic medication. Experimental results have demonstrated the effect of GTE on the oxidative pathway significantly ameliorating the effects of pancreatic injury. The various green tea catechins especially Epigallocatechin-3- gallate (EGCG) can perhaps be useful lead compounds for new drug discovery.With no specific targeted therapy for severe acute pancreatitis at present, various medications have been tested. The possibility of targeting initial acinar cell injury may not be a feasible option as patient presentation and management would usually be after this phase. As the disease progresses, severe acute pancreatitis is characterised by inflammation and necrosis. The hypothesis of preserving pancreatic parenchymal microvascular patency and thus ameliorating pancreatic injury through the early administration of recombinant human Activated Protein C (rhAPC) has identified a potential treatment for acute pancreatitis. rhAPC converted from its inactive precursor, protein C, by thrombin acts through fibrinolysis and inhibition of thrombosis. Studies on rhAPC in experimental acute pancreatitis examined the modulation of rhAPC on inflammatory markers, morphology, microvascular thrombosis and apoptosis. The encouraging results from initial experimental work helped set up the Phase 2 clinical trial of administering rhAPC early on in severe acute pancreatitis. Prior to taking this significant step from bench to bed side, the variation in functional protein C levels with the severity of the disease was examined as a precursor to the Phase 2 trial.

The bialaphos biosynthetic genes of Streptomyces hygroscopicus: Cloning and analysis of the genes involved in the alanylation step
We have isolated and studied the genes involved in the alanylation step in the biosynthesis of a herbicide, bialaphos which is produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus. Three bialaphos-nonproducing mutants, NP60, NP61 and NP62, isolated from S. hygroscopicus by treatment with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine were defective for the alanylation step and were not restored to productivity by any locus of the gene cluster previously cloned. Three plasmids were isolated using NP60, NP61 and NP62 as recipients. The genes which restored productivity to NP61 and NP62 hybridized to the contiguous region of the bialaphos biosynthetic gene cluster. The gene cluster involved in the bialaphos production was about 35 kb long. The gene which restored productivity to NP60 did not hybridize to the bialaphos biosynthetic gene cluster. VM3 and VM4, putative alanylation blocked mutants, were derived from a bialaphos producer by gene replacement of an unidentified region of the biosynthetic gene cluster with an in vitro altered DNA sequence. The genes which restored productivity to VM3 and VM4 were located between the genes which code for phosphinomethylmalic acid synthetase and demethylphosphinothricin acetyltransferase in the cluster. These results suggest that multiple genes are involved in the alanylation step.

Functional bowel symptoms in diabetes--the role of autonomic neuropathy.
The autonomic nervous system may have a role in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome. If so, the occurrence of irritable bowel symptomatology in patients with autonomic neuropathy might indicate which, if any, of these symptoms are dependent on autonomic innervation. The prevalence of abdominal pain, abdominal distension and an abnormal bowel habit was recorded in 200 patients with diabetes, screened for autonomic neuropathy, and 200 matched controls. Constipation was significantly more common in patients with autonomic neuropathy than in those without, or controls (22.0% vs 9.2% vs 6.8%). The prevalence of abdominal pain and abdominal distension was no different in patients with and without autonomic neuropathy and their respective controls. The results of this study suggest that control of bowel habit is more dependent on the total integrity of the autonomic nervous system than the perception of pain or the production of distension.

Interactive Grid Based Binning for Information Visualization
Clutter within information visualization (infovis) systems is an area of continuing concern and is receiving increasing research interest. Solutions to the problem vary in their approach, ranging from novel visualizations designed specifically to cope with high data density, through to statistical methodologies such as binning. This paper presents a flexible method that allows interactive placement of a grid based binning system that aims to enhance traditional information visualization techniques. User evaluations employing two specific visualization methods are described using a prototype grid based binning system. The method is shown to be a quick and easy way to visually segment a data domain, while the two visualization techniques presented are shown to provide effective data overview. Due to the abstracted nature of the binning grid, its applicability goes beyond the examples provided in this paper, therefore it could be considered as a generic data reduction and/or overview technique within many systems.

[inflammation, effector, site, inflammatory, cell]

The therapeutic potential of positive and negative immune cell co-stimulation during inflammation.
Inflammatory cascades are initiated in response to alarm signals that may result from infection, malignant transformation or trauma. Immunity, however, must be controlled; otherwise damage may occur to otherwise healthy tissue within the same microenvironment. Similarly, peripheral tolerance mechanisms must ensure that autoreactive thymic or bone marrow emigrants do not respond upon encounter with the autoantigen. Organized lymphoid structures such as lymph nodes, spleen and Peyer's patches appear to regulate inflammation successfully, displaying controlled expansion and contraction. However, when immune cells flood into effector sites, the organization of T- and B-lymphocytes is lacking. What controls inflammatory cascades in lymph nodes but rarely in effector sites is not clear. We believe the difference lies in the Toll-like receptor ligand load, which is high in effector sites and drives uncontrolled inflammation. Similarly, we believe that initiation of autoimmune inflammation is initiated by the liberation of inflammatory signals due to infection or trauma. In this review, we highlight some of the molecules responsible for maintaining an activated T-cell phenotype, strategies to interrupt these therapeutically and the impact of ligating inhibitory receptors on antigen-presenting cells.

Controlled synthesis of radiolabelled amine methacrylate water-soluble polymers with end-groups of varying hydrophobicity and studies of adsorption behaviour
The effect of chain end chemistry on the behaviour of poly(2-(diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) has been studied through the placement of various radioactive groups with increasing hydrophobicity at the chain end of the polymer. Controlled radical polymerisation with (14)C-labelled initiators was used to form polymers of very similar chain length including doubly-labelled, fluorescent-radio polymers. Monitoring and quantification of behaviour was conducted purely using radiotechniques, without the need for fluorescence measurement, showing a clear impact on solid surface adsorption across a range of surface types (filter paper, photographic paper and hair). The studies presented here have clear implications for the study of polymer behaviour through low level fluorescent modification of water-soluble polymers.

Prediction Of Combination Efficacy In Cancer Therapy
The cell cycle is an essential process in all living organisms that must be carefully regulated to ensure successful cell growth and division. Disregulation of the cell cycle is a key contributing factor towards the formation of cancerous cells. Understanding events at a cellular level is the first step towards comprehending how cancer manifests at an organismal level. Mathematical modelling can be used as a means of formalising and predicting the behaviour of the biological systems involved in cancer. In response, cell cycle models have been constructed to simulate and predict what happens to the mammalian cell over a time course in response to variable parameters.Current cell cycle models rarely account for certain precursors of cell growth such as energy usage and the need for non-essential amino acids as fundamental building blocks of macromolecules. Normal and cancer cell metabolism differ in the way they derive energy from glucose. In addition, normal and cancer cells also demonstrate different levels of gene expression. Two versions of a mammalian cell cycle and metabolism model, based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that respond to fluctuations in glucose concentration levels, have been developed here for the normal and cancer cell scenarios. Sensitivity analysis is performed for both normal and cancer cells using these cell cycle and metabolism models to investigate which kinetic reaction steps have a greater effect over the cell cycle period. Detailed analysis of the models and quantitatively assessing metabolite levels at various stages of the cell cycle may offer novel insights into how the glycolytic rate varies during the cell cycle for both normal and cancer cells.The results of the sensitivity analysis are used to identify potential drug targets in cancer therapy. Combinations of these individual targets are also investigated to compare the different effects of single and multiple drug compounds on the time it takes to complete a cell division cycle.

Abiotic drivers and plant traits explain landscape-scale patterns in soil microbial communities
The controls on aboveground community composition and diversity have been extensively studied, but our understanding of the drivers of belowground microbial communities is relatively lacking, despite their importance for ecosystem functioning. In this study, we fitted statistical models to explain landscape-scale variation in soil microbial community composition using data from 180 sites covering a broad range of grassland types, soil and climatic conditions in England. We found that variation in soil microbial communities was explained by abiotic factors like climate, pH and soil properties. Biotic factors, namely community-weighted means (CWM) of plant functional traits, also explained variation in soil microbial communities. In particular, more bacterial-dominated microbial communities were associated with exploitative plant traits versus fungal-dominated communities with resource-conservative traits, showing that plant functional traits and soil microbial communities are closely related at the landscape scale.

Erectile dysfunction after open versus angioplasty aortoiliac procedures: a questionnaire survey.
Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common complication after aortoiliac surgery. The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of ED in patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease or aneurysm and evaluate the effect of revascularization by means of open surgery or iliac angioplasty/stenting upon erectile function by using the new International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire. All male patients who had previously undergone open aortoiliac reconstruction or iliac angioplasty/stenting and who were alive at the time of this study were first contacted by telephone. Those who agreed to take part in the study were sent anonymous IIEF questionnaires. Patients were asked to recall their sexual function before and 3 months after the procedure. ED was defined as IIEF score of <11. After telephone interview, a total of 116 patients agreed to take part in the study. The response rate was 61%. Two patients, one in each group, had ED preoperatively. The preoperative IIEF scores were no different in surgery and angioplasty/stenting groups (p=0.3). Overall, 46/63 patients reported worsening erectile function postoperatively. In the surgery group (n=37), 32 patients reported deterioration of their sexual function, 3 no change, and 2 improvement, while in the angioplasty/stenting group (n=26), 14 patients had deterioration, 11 no change, and 1 improvement. In both groups, the IIEF score decreased significantly postintervention; however, the deterioration was much more pronounced after open surgery (p<0.001). Of the 61 patients with "normal" erectile function (IIEF > or =11), 10 patients (28%) developed ED following surgery, but none after angioplasty/stenting (p=0.003). As judged by the IIEF, a significant proportion of patients undergoing open and endovascular procedures experience worsening sexual function.

GUARDIANS final report part 1 (draft): a robot swarm assisting a human fire fighter
Emergencies in industrial warehouses are a major concern for fire fighters. The large dimensions together with the development of dense smoke that drastically reduces visibility, represent major challenges. The Guardians robot swarm is designed to assist re ghters in searching a
large warehouse. In this paper we discuss the technology developed for a swarm of robots assisting re ghters. We explain the swarming algorithms which provide the functionality by which the robots react to and follow humans while no communication is required. Next we discuss the wireless communication system, which is a so-called mobile ad-hoc network. The communication network provides also the means to locate the robots and humans. Thus the robot swarm is able to provide guidance information to the humans. Together with the fire fighters we explored how
the robot swarm should feed information back to the human fire fighter. We have designed and experimented with interfaces for presenting swarm based information to human beings.

Analysis of internal wave induced mode coupling effects on the 1995 SWARM experiment acoustic transmissions
As part of the Shallow Water Acoustics in a Random Medium (SWARM) experiment
1, a sixteen element WHOI vertical line array (WVLA) was moored in 70 meters
of water off the New Jersey coast. This array was sampled at 1395 Hz or higher for
the seven days it was deployed. Tomography sources with carrier frequencies of 224
and 400 Hz were moored about 32 km shoreward, such that the acoustic path was
anti-parallel to the primary propagation direction for shelf generated internal wave
solitons. Two models for the propagation of normal modes through a 2-D waveguide
with solitary internal wave (soliton) scattering included are developed to help
in understanding the very complicated mode arrivals seen at the WVLA. The simplest
model uses the Preisig and Duda 2 sharp interface approximation for solitons,
allowing for rapid analysis of the effects of various numbers of solitons on mode arrival
statistics. The second model, using SWARM thermistor string data to simulate
the actual SWARM waveguides, is more realistic, but much slower. The analysis of
the actual WVLA data yields spread, bias, wander, and intensity fluctuation signals
that are modulated at tidal frequencies. The signals are consistent with predicted
relationships to the internal wave distributions in the waveguides.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution June 1997The funds for my education were

Occupational stress among hospital nurses in Gaza-Palestine
Background: Occupational stress in nursing is common worldwide; with rates of 9.20%-68.0% of nurses suffering from stress being reported in the worldwide literature. This thesis reports an investigation into stress among hospital nurses in Gaza Strip-Palestine. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of occupational stress among hospital nurses in Gaza-Palestine and explore possible causal occupational stressors. Method: A quantitative survey design was employed, with a self-administered questionnaire pack being the data collection technique. Data were collected on psychological distress (GHQ-12), depression (SLC-D), sources of stress (NSS), trauma (IES-R) and demographic variables. Open questions were used to enable participants to describe their experiences of stressful events and enable the researcher to collect more in-depth information regarding some aspects of the stress domains. Data were analysed by SPSS using a variety of descriptive and inferential statistical methods: T-test, one way ANOVA and logistic regression were employed.Sample: The study population is the entire cohort of nurses who were working in the 16 hospitals in Gaza (1801 nurses; 985 males) during the period August 2009 through March 2010. Because of difficulties in access, only 1500 were able to receive questionnaire packs and 1133 were completed and returned (response rate=75.53%).  Results: The results of this study revealed a high prevalence of psychological distress (63%, GHQ-12 cut-off=6), depression (59.7%, SCL-D cut-off=1.5) and trauma (69.4%, IES-R cut-off=35). The most severe occupational stressors were: ‘Not enough staff to adequately cover the unit’, ‘Lack of drugs and equipments required for nursing care’ and ‘Unpredictable staffing and scheduling’ respectively. The most frequent occupational stressors were: ‘Not enough staff to adequately cover the unit’, ‘Watching a patient suffer’ and ‘Lack of drugs and equipments required for nursing care’ respectively. As subscales, ‘Workload’ and ‘Death and dying’ were the most frequent and severe occupational stressors.Psychological distress was significantly associated with gender, age, experience, night shifts and extra-work. Depression was significantly associated with gender, hospital type, age, night shifts, experience and marital status. Severity of occupational stressors was significantly associated with age, night shifts, specialisation and qualifications. Frequency of occupational stressors was significantly associated with hospital type, experience specialisation and night shifts. Finally, trauma was significantly associated with hospital type, experience and night shifts. The predictors of psychological distress caseness (GHQ-12) were: depression caseness, uncertainty about treatment (severity), experience and qualifications of nurses. Protective factors were: extra work and experience of more than 15 years. Conclusion: Being a nurse in Gaza hospitals appears to be a stressful experience. More attention should be focused to develop an effective programme to reduce stress levels among Palestinian nurses in Gaza.

Breathlessness and exercise tolerance in chronic airflow obstruction: 2-hourly versus 4-hourly salbutamol by inhalation.
Breathlessness, exercise tolerance, and spirometry were measured in 12 patients whose major symptom was breathlessness, secondary to severe chronic airflow limitation, during a double-blind crossover comparison of inhaled salbutamol in two dosages (200 micrograms 4-hourly and 200 micrograms 2-hourly) with placebo. Daily visual analogue scores of breathlessness, exercise tolerance and spirometry were all significantly improved with salbutamol in both dosages compared to placebo. The 2-hourly regimen was superior to the 4-hourly regimen only in terms of exercise tolerance. Walking distance had deteriorated significantly 2 hours after salbutamol on the 4-hourly regimen and was usefully increased by an extra dose of salbutamol on the 2-hourly regimen at the equivalent time, without side-effects. Salbutamol provided considerable symptomatic relief in addition to spirometric improvement in patients with chronic airflow limitation.

Capturing complexities of student leadership: knowledge, power and practicalities
Over the past decade student participation in school leadership has gained prominence in the field of education. However, the concept of ‘student leadership’ remains broad and elusive, allowing many school leaders to misuse it in ways that serve their own needs. Student leadership is defined here as student participation in activities which promote self-advocacy (Lansdown, 2000: 16). There are very few studies which actually examine the relationship between student leadership and school decision-making. This paper reports on a case study of student-led project at an independent high school in England. The students lead a consortium of teachers and administrators at the school to draw up policy recommendation on learning with ICT at the school, which are forwarded to the school’s senior management team. Using the case study as reference, this paper argues that student leadership although full of hopes and aspirations for the future of education, is at present fraught with complexities. These include issues of knowledge: when the roles of learner and teacher are reversed, power: based on who decided what is included in the agendas, and practicalities such as time and resources.Lansdown, G.

Targeted agents in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): clinical developments and rationale for the combination with thoracic radiotherapy.
In recent years there has been undoubted progress in the evaluation and development of targeted agents for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A major contributor has been the discovery of molecular subtypes harbouring a critical oncogenic driver mutation, specifically sensitizing mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene and the EML4-ALK gene translocation. Radiotherapy is a cornerstone of therapy for the curative intent treatment of early stage, localized disease; and for the palliation of symptoms in advanced, metastatic disease. In this molecular targeted era there is limited understanding of how best to combine targeted agents with radiotherapy and in general clinical studies with radiotherapy have lagged behind studies of targeted agents with chemotherapy. Here we summarise the progress made to date and highlight future directions.

EGFR and KRAS mutational analysis and their correlation to survival in pancreatic and periampullary cancer.
OBJECTIVES: Pancreatic and periampullary cancers have a high incidence of activating KRAS mutations. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of KRAS and EGFR mutations in pancreatic and periampullary cancers and their relationship with survival. METHODS: One hundred patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy or pancreatic biopsy for cancer were recruited. Samples of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded or fresh pancreatic tissue were obtained. EGFR was analyzed by DNA sequencing of exons 18 to 21. KRAS was analyzed by pyrosequencing of codons 12, 13, and 61. RESULTS: EGFR mutations were found in 2 (2.3%) of 88 assessable cases. One in exon 18 (c.1966C>T, p.Q710X) and 1 in exon 19 (c.2066A>G, p.E734G). A synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism in exon 20 (c.2361G>A, p.Q787) was identified in 57 (67.8%) of 84 patients studied. Twenty-eight (41.2%) of 68 cases harbored a point mutation in KRAS codon 12 (26 cases) and codon 61 (2 cases). The overall median survival was 308 days (range, 7-2623 days). The presence of KRAS point mutations did not significantly alter median survival time (22.8 vs 28.1 months, P = 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: EGFR somatic mutations are rare in pancreatobiliary malignancies. KRAS mutations are less common than previous reports and do not correlate with survival.

Fall incidence and outcomes of falls in a prospective study of adults with rheumatoid arthritis.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of falls and to investigate the consequences of falls in adults with rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: 559 community dwelling adults with RA, aged 18 to 88 years (mean age 62; 69% female) participated in this prospective cohort study. Patients were followed for 1 year after a detailed clinical assessment, using monthly falls calendars and follow-up telephone calls. Follow-up took place in participants' usual place of residence in the Northwest of England. Outcome measures included fall occurrence, reason for fall, type and severity of injuries, fractures, fall location, lie-times, use of health services and functional ability. RESULTS: 535 participants followed for 1 year had a total of 598 falls. 36.4% participants (95% CI 32% to 41%) reported falling during 1 year follow-up with an incidence rate of 1313/1000 person-years at risk or 1.11 falls per person. Age and gender were not associated with falls. Over one third of the falls were reportedly caused by hips, knees or ankle joints giving way. Over half of all the falls resulted in moderate injuries, including head injuries (n=27) and fractures (n=26). Treatment by general practitioners or other health professionals was required for 15.0% of falls and emergency services were required after 8.8% of falls. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that adults with RA are at high risk of falls and fall-related injuries, fractures and head injuries. Strategies to prevent falls in adults with RA must be prioritised to reduce falls and fall-related injuries, and fractures. © 2012 by the American College of Rheumatology.

Unmasking of axial spondyloarthritis and oligoarthritis following discontinuation of tumour necrosis factor inhibitor therapy for psoriasis.
Psoriatic arthritis remains a common cause of morbidity in patients with psoriasis. Little is known about the natural history of the disease and dermatologists do not consistently screen for its presence. We describe a patient with severe psoriasis where long-term biologic therapy with a tumour necrosis factor inhibitor was interrupted for clinical reasons, leading to a rapidly evolving axial spondyloarthritis and oligoarthritis. This unusual presentation of psoriatic arthritis may reflect masking of the disease by long-term treatment with a tumour necrosis factor inhibitor. We advocate the use of screening for psoriatic arthritis, including before and during treatment with biologic therapies.

Rearrangement of the oxide-semiconductor interface in annealed Al2O3/4H-SiC structures
<p>Al2O3 films with different thicknesses have been deposited on n-type (nitrogen-doped) 4H-SiC(0001) epitaxial samples by atomic layer chemical vapor deposition at 300 degrees C and subsequently annealed in Ar atmosphere at temperatures up to 1000 degrees C. The Al2O3/4H-SiC structures were analyzed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The XPS and SIMS results indicate that the average composition in the wider interface area does not significantly change due to the annealing. However, as revealed by the TEM investigations in combination with XPS, the as-grown samples exhibit a double interface created by an intermediate suboxide SiOx layer (x &lt; 2). After annealing, this intermediate suboxide layer breaks up and transforms into SiO2 islands, resulting in a rather rough interface region and a high concentration of pure Si in the Al2O3 film. Furthermore, a pronounced accumulation of H is found in the rough interface region and this may play a key role for the low density of shallow electron states reported for annealed Al2O3/4H-SiC structures.</p>

The role of E-cadherin in mouse embryonic stem cell pluripotency
To exploit pluripotent cells for regenerative medicine applications it will be necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms that govern pluripotency and lineage commitment within these cells. The mechanism by which LIF sustains ‘naïve’ pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cell has recently been delineated; LIF signals to the core circuitry of pluripotency (Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog) via Jak/STAT3 and PI3K/Akt-mediated expression of Klf4 and Tbx3 respectively. E-cadherin has been shown to be required for LIF-dependent mES cell pluripotency since cell lines exhibiting low/no E-cadherin expression maintain pluripotency via Activin/Nodal. However, these cells maintain expression of the core circuitry of pluripotency, thus the role of E-cadherin in pluripotency remains elusive. To investigate this, we have characterised an E-cadherin negative proliferating stem (ENPS) cell line, generated by seeding wt mES cells at low density in the absence of LIF. These cells exhibit Activin/Nodal-dependent pluripotency marker expression but fail pluripotency tests such as EB differentiation and chimera generation and microarray analysis shows they lack naïve transcripts and express early lineage markers. We have also exploited two additional E-cadherin negative cell lines (Ecad-/- and EcadRNAi mES cells) to delineate the molecular mechanisms connecting E-cadherin to the core circuitry of pluripotency. These cells exhibit decreased expression of pluripotency markers Klf4 and Nanog, the latter a direct consequence of a lack of E-cadherin-mediated STAT3 activation. Interestingly, both ENPS and Ecad-/- mES cells can be ‘rescued’ to a naïve pluripotent state upon LIF stimulation. In ENPS cells, LIF supplementation induces restoration of E-cadherin expression, LIF-dependent pluripotency and EB and chimera generation abilities. In Ecad-/- mES cells, LIF supplemention restores LIF-dependent pluripotency via N-cadherin, thus demonstrating a novel role for N-cadherin in mES cell pluripotency. At high passage, ENPS cells (like some cancer cells) exhibit methylation of the E-cadherin promoter and PI3K-dependent increased survival compared to wt mES cells. Our findings provide a potential mechanism for the role of E-cadherin in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell generation, since STAT3 phosphorylation has recently been shown to be a limiting factor in this process. In addition, our data suggest E-cadherin can be manipulated to direct differentiation for regenerative medicine applications since ENPS cells exhibit a lineage bias towards neuroectoderm at the expense of endoderm specification.

The Soil Moisture Active and Passive Mission (SMAP): Science and Applications
The soil moisture active and passive mission (SMAP) will provide global maps of soil moisture content and surface freeze/thaw state. Global measurements of these variables are critical for terrestrial water and carbon cycle applications. The SMAP observatory consists of two multipolarization L-band sensors, a radar and radiometer, that share a deployable-mesh reflector antenna. The combined observations from the two sensors will allow accurate estimation of soil moisture at hydrometeorological (10 km) and hydroclimatological (40 km) spatial scales. The rotating antenna configuration provides conical scans of the Earth surface at a constant look angle. The wide-swath (1000 km) measurements will allow global mapping of soil moisture and its freeze/thaw state with 2-3 days revisit. Freeze/thaw in boreal latitudes will be mapped using the radar at 3 km resolution with 1-2 days revisit.

Caveolin-1-/- null mammary stromal fibroblasts share characteristics with human breast cancer-associated fibroblasts.
Recently, we reported that human breast cancer-associated fibroblasts show functional inactivation of the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor and down-regulation of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) protein expression. However, it remains unknown whether loss of Cav-1 is sufficient to confer functional RB inactivation in mammary fibroblasts. To establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship, mammary stromal fibroblasts (MSFs) were prepared from Cav-1(-/-) null mice and subjected to phenotypic analysis. Here, we provide evidence that Cav-1(-/-) MSFs share many characteristics with human cancer-associated fibroblasts. The Cav-1(-/-) MSF transcriptome significantly overlaps with human cancer-associated fibroblasts; both show a nearly identical profile of RB/E2F-regulated genes that are up-regulated, which is consistent with RB inactivation. This Cav-1(-/-) MSF gene signature is predictive of poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen. Consistent with these findings, Cav-1(-/-) MSFs show RB hyperphosphorylation and the up-regulation of estrogen receptor co-activator genes. We also evaluated the paracrine effects of "conditioned media" prepared from Cav-1(-/-) MSFs on wild-type mammary epithelia. Our results indicate that Cav-1(-/-) MSF "conditioned media" is sufficient to induce an epithelial-mesenchymal transition, indicative of an invasive phenotype. Proteomic analysis of this "conditioned media" reveals increased levels of proliferative/angiogenic growth factors. Consistent with these findings, Cav-1(-/-) MSFs are able to undergo endothelial-like transdifferentiation. Thus, these results have important implications for understanding the role of cancer-associated fibroblasts and RB inactivation in promoting tumor angiogenesis.

The multifunctional peptide, Tat-LK15:A study of its cellular uptake and its potential use in drug delivery
AbstractCell penetrating peptides (CPPs) have been used in many areas of drug delivery for mediating the delivery of peptides, protein, DNA, siRNA and liposomes. Additionally they have shown an ability to overcome drug resistance in cells enhancing chemotherapeutic activity. Our group has recently designed a promising multifunctional peptide, Tat-LK15, originating from the fusion of Tat peptide (49-57) with the synthetic amphipathic peptide, LK15. TAT-LK15 was found to be efficient at mediating DNA and siRNA delivery to cells especially contributing to the silencing of bcr-abl oncoprotein over a long period of time. To date, Tat-LK15 peptide’s cells uptake mechanism, which is expected to be influenced by the presence of the amphipathic sequence LK15, which is known to be lytic, has not been assessed. The aim of this project is to study the cellular uptake of the Tat-LK15 peptide and any influence it exerts on the uptake of p-glycoproteins substrates. Also we aimed to explore whether the peptide characteristics could be exploited to improve the delivery of the cytotoxic agent, doxorubicin.Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy experiments revealed that Tat-LK15 uptake was dependent on two mechanisms depending on the concentration of peptide used. At low concentrations (2.5µM and below) the uptake of TAMRA-Tat-LK15 peptide appeared to be temperature-dependent and was inhibited by sodium azide suggesting endocytosis as the main route of entry in the studied cell lines. At 5µM and above, the peptide’s uptake was less reliant on temperature and not be inhibited by sodium azide, but relied on membrane potential. Interestingly in K562 cells, the peptide accumulated on the cell membrane.The Tat-LK15 peptide membrane activity was also characterised: Tat-LK15 lytic activity was concentration-dependent. At 5µM the Tat-LK15 peptide led to approximately 60% LDH release in HT29 cells which is likely to be related to the amphipathic sequence, LK15 renowned for its membrane lytic activity. Further to this, the uptake of a membrane impermeant dye (SYTOX® blue) incubated with the peptide was followed as a function of time in K562 cells with a high content screening. The results appeared to substantiate the above findings that Tat-LK15 peptide has a concentration- and time-dependent membrane lytic activity. An MTT assay, after four hours of incubation, indicated very limited variation in cytotoxicity (EC50 ~ 5µM) over six different cell lines. More importantly, an Annexin V assay suggested a possible induction of apoptosis in the MCF-7 cell line, in contrast a Tat-LK15 concentration-dependent necrosis was observed in a K562 cell line. Finally attempts were made to exploit the properties of Tat-LK15 to overcome drug resistance of doxorubicin. Firstly Tat-LK15 peptide co-incubation with a model P-gp substrate (calcein AM) revealed a significant reduction of calcein fluorescence in K562 and HT29 cells and their doxorubicin resistant sublines (p<0.05). Attempts to conjugate doxorubicin to TAT-LK15 proved difficult. Consequently doxorubicin/Tat-LK15 admixtures were used to study whether the P-gp efflux of doxorubicin in doxorubicin resistance sublines could be circumvented. A significant increase of the toxicity relative to doxorubicin alone for long incubation times on several cell lines (p<0.05) indicated that using TAT-LK15 as an additive could potentially be considered as a drug delivery strategy. Thus the concept of conjugating a well known cell penetrating peptide to an amphipathic sequence is worthwhile however the findings in this study are not sufficient to highlight the full potential and major  improvements in efficacy needs to be achieved.

Volumetric and area-based measures of mammographic density in women with and without cancer
We compare mammographic density in 44 women with screen-detected breast cancer and a control group of 923 women with normal screening mammograms. Multiple regression was used to compare the effects of case-control status on breast density of the contra-lateral breast. Two breast density measures were investigated: the average visual assessment, recorded on a visual analogue scale (VAS), for the two views and two independent readers; and volumetric percentage density measured by QuantraTM. We adjusted for confounding factors of BMI, HRT use, age and menopausal status. Initially there was no significant difference in mean percentage density between cases and controls using either measure of density: VAS (cases 27.5%, controls 26.9%) and QuantraTM (cases 17.2%, controls 18.2%). However, when confounding factors were controlled for, case-control status had a statistically significant effect on breast density as measured by QuantraTM (adjusted means: cases 19.2%, controls 14.8%; p = 0.002) but not by VAS.

The measurement of serum arabinitol in the diagnosis of systemic candidosis was evaluated using a gas-liquid chromatography technique in a cohort of at risk patients. The prevalence of seropositivity was low and did not correlate with evidence of infection. This technique is unlikely to achieve acceptance because it does not discriminate between patients with and without infection; it requires specialised equipment and it is expensive.

Effect of support fluids on pile performance - a field trial in east London
Synthetic polymer support fluids have been used in the UK for about a decade, although naturally derived polymers such as xanthan gum have been used for much longer. Very little research has been carried out to assess the effects of polymer fluids and especially synthetic polymers on pile performance.A field trial comprising the construction and testing of three piles has been carried out at Stratford in east London. The objectives of the trial were to compare the effects of polymer and bentonite support fluids on pile performance, to assess the effect of extended bore open time for the polymer piles, and to quantify the effect of support fluid contamination on the hardened properties of concrete. It was found that the two polymer piles significantly outperformed the bentonite pile under the maximum proof load, and that no adverse effect was caused by the extended soil-fluid exposure time in the polymer-supported bore. The two support fluids were also found to have similar effects on concrete quality.

[fibroblast, cancer, mitochondrial, tumor, oxidative, tfam-deficient, model, production, cell, breast]

Mitochondrial oxidative stress in cancer-associated fibroblasts drives lactate production, promoting breast cancer tumor growth: understanding the aging and cancer connection.
Increasing chronological age is the most significant risk factor for cancer. Recently, we proposed a new paradigm for understanding the role of the aging and the tumor microenvironment in cancer onset. In this model, cancer cells induce oxidative stress in adjacent stromal fibroblasts. This, in turn, causes several changes in the phenotype of the fibroblast including mitochondrial dysfunction, hydrogen peroxide production, and aerobic glycolysis, resulting in high levels of L-lactate production. L-lactate is then transferred from these glycolytic fibroblasts to adjacent epithelial cancer cells and used as "fuel" for oxidative mitochondrial metabolism.  Here, we created a new pre-clinical model system to directly test this hypothesis experimentally. To synthetically generate glycolytic fibroblasts, we genetically-induced mitochondrial dysfunction by knocking down TFAM using an sh-RNA approach.  TFAM is mitochondrial transcription factor A, which is important in functionally maintaining the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Interestingly, TFAM-deficient fibroblasts showed evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, with the loss of certain mitochondrial respiratory chain components, and the over-production of hydrogen peroxide and L-lactate. Thus, TFAM-deficient fibroblasts underwent metabolic reprogramming towards aerobic glycolysis.  Most importantly, TFAM-deficient fibroblasts significantly promoted tumor growth, as assayed using a human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) xenograft model. These increases in glycolytic fibroblast driven tumor growth were independent of tumor angiogenesis. Mechanistically, TFAM-deficient fibroblasts increased the mitochondrial activity of adjacent epithelial cancer cells in a co-culture system, as seen using MitoTracker. Finally, TFAM-deficient fibroblasts also showed a loss of caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a known breast cancer stromal biomarker. Loss of stromal fibroblast Cav-1 is associated with early tumor recurrence, metastasis, and treatment failure, resulting in poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients. Thus, this new experimental model system, employing glycolytic fibroblasts, may be highly clinically relevant. These studies also have implications for understanding the role of hydrogen peroxide production in oxidative damage and "host cell aging," in providing a permissive metabolic microenvironment for promoting and sustaining tumor growth.

Whose line is it anyway? De-signing organisational change in the case of MyAirport moving to become more sustainable
The article draws on an ongoing ethnographic study of an international airport, known as MyAirport, and its desire to become a more ‘sustainable’ airport. By employing frame analysis, inspired by the tradition of Goffman’s social interactionism, we attempted to identify the multiple ways in which ‘sustainability’ was framed by a variety of social actors at MyAirport. In so doing, we attempted to show the indeterminate nature of changing as we traced the way the ambitions of becoming more ‘sustainable’ was made sense of in everyday occurrences at MyAirport. Therefore, the main contribution of this article lies in the treatment of organisational change as an ongoing process of changing and sense-making. By following our social actors, observing their daily practices, and articulating their multiple frames of ‘sustainability’ work, we provide richer accounts of how changing in organisations are mobilised, often through conceptualisations of the present and re-conceptualisations of the ever growing past. Change is therefore not a static and stable point of destination, waiting for the researcher to analyse; rather changing demands getting close to the actions as organisations constantly move, get moved and evolves.

[jnk, apoptotic, bax]

The regulation of Bax by c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) is a prerequisite to the mitochondrial-induced apoptotic pathway.
The signaling mechanism by which JNK affects mitochondria is critical to initiate apoptosis. Here we show that the absence of JNK provides a partial resistance to the toxic effect of the heavy metal cadmium. Both wild type and jnk-/- fibroblasts undergoing death exhibit cytosolic cytochrome c but, unlike wild type cells, the JNK-deficient fibroblasts do not display increased caspase activity and DNA fragmentation. The absence of apoptotic death correlates with a specific defect in activation of Bax. We conclude that JNK-dependent regulation of Bax is essential to mediate the apoptotic release of cytochrome c regardless of Bid and Bim activation.

A new overset grid algorithm applied to the simulation of flows involving complex geometries
The generation of structured grids around complex geometries is generally a difficult task. This task is typically a major bottleneck in the overall solution procedure; however, the overset grid method can be used to relieve much of this burden. An overset grid consists of a set of simple component grids, which can overlap arbitrarily (provided there is sufficient overlap to interpolate from). The union of all simple grids should then delineate the global domain. This allows complex domains to meshed using a series of simple meshes.A new overset hole cutting algorithm is developed in order to automatically combine the series of simple meshes into an overset domain. It has been shown that for a variety of test cases, continuous and accurate solutions are obtained from one grid to another, which are comparable to experimental data.

First generation versus second generation (non-clozapine) antipsychotic drugs versus clozapine in schizophrenia: The CUtLASS trials Abstract. 44th Annual Meeting of American College of Neuropsychology (ACNP), Waikoloa, Hawaii, US.
Background: Two non-commercially-funded, pragmatic, open, multisite,  randomised, controlled trials (CUtLASS 1 and 2) were conducted in the UK NHS in order (i) to compare SGAs (other than clozapine) with FGAs, in people with schizophrenia requiring a change of treatment because of inadequate response or adverse effects and (ii) to compare clozapine with the class of other SGAs in people who had responded poorly to two or more prior antipsychotic drugs. The hypotheses were that SGA drugs would outperform FGA drugs; and clozapine would outperform other SGA drugs.Methods: Participants were aged 18-65 with DSM-4 schizophrenia and related disorders. In CUtLASS 1, participants were randomly allocated to either FGA or SGA classes (amisulpride, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone). In CUtLASS 2, participants were randomly allocated to clozapine, or to one of the other SGA drugs. The choice of individual drug within the allocated class was made in advance by the managing clinician. Randomised samples were 227 and 136 respectively. Outcomes were assessed blind to treatment allocation at 12, 26 and 52 weeks. Complete follow up assessments at one year were obtained in 81% and 87% of the samples respectively.Results: In CUtLASS 1, there were no advantages of SGA over FGA drugs. Participants in the FGA arm showed a trend toward greater improvements in QLS and PANSS scores. Participants reported no clear preference for either class of drug; costs were similar. In CUtLASS 2, an intent to treat comparison showed an advantage for commencing clozapine in QLS score at trend level (3.6 points; CI 0.5-7.7; p=0.08), and in PANSS total score that was statistically significant (4.9 points; CI 1.1-8.8; p=0.01), at one year. At 12 weeks, participants receiving clozapine reported that their mental health was significantly better compared with those receiving SGA drugs.Discussion: In people with schizophrenia whose medication is changed for clinical reasons, there is no clinical or cost advantage over one year in using non-clozapine FGA drugs rather than clozapine SGA drugs.Neither inadequate power nor patterns of drug discontinuation could account for this result. There is an advantage to commencing clozapine rather than other SGA drugs in terms of symptoms and patient preference over one year.

Anaesthesia and airway management in mucopolysaccharidosis.
This paper provides a detailed overview and discussion of anaesthesia in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS), the evaluation of risk factors in these patients and their anaesthetic management, including emergency airway issues. MPS represents a group of rare lysosomal storage disorders associated with an array of clinical manifestations. The high prevalence of airway obstruction and restrictive pulmonary disease in combination with cardiovascular manifestations poses a high anaesthetic risk to these patients. Typical anaesthetic problems include airway obstruction after induction or extubation, intubation difficulties or failure can't intubate, can't ventilate (CICV), possible emergency tracheostomy and cardiovascular and cervical spine issues. Because of the high anaesthetic risk, the benefits of a procedure in patients with MPS should always be balanced against the associated risks. Therefore, careful evaluation of anaesthetic risk factors should be made before the procedure, involving evaluation of airways and cardiorespiratory and cervical spine problems. In addition, information on the specific type of MPS, prior history of anaesthesia, presence of cervical instability and range of motion of the temporomandibular joint are important and may be pivotal to prevent complications during anaesthesia. Knowledge of these risk factors allows the anaesthetist to anticipate potential problems that may arise during or after the procedure. Anaesthesia in MPS patients should be preferably done by an experienced (paediatric) anaesthetist, supported by a multidisciplinary team (ear, nose, throat surgeon and intensive care team), with access to all necessary equipment and support.

Investigation into the influence of a high fat diet on antipsychotic-induced weight gain in female rats.
Atypical antipsychotic drug therapy may result in substantial weight gain, increased adiposity and the promotion of metabolic abnormalities. The mechanism(s) which underlie such effects remain unclear. Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated significant weight gain in female rats maintained on a standard laboratory diet after sub-chronic administration of olanzapine and risperidone, but not ziprasidone. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of antipsychotic drugs on body weight, ingestive behaviour and adiposity in female rats with access to a high fat diet. Adult female rats given free access to a high fat diet received either olanzapine (2 mg/kg), risperidone (0.5 mg/kg), ziprasidone (2.5 mg/kg) or vehicle for 28 days. Body weight, food and water intake in addition to intra-abdominal fat deposition were assessed. Olanzapine initially increased body weight but by the end of the study olanzapine animals appeared to have lost weight compared to the vehicle-treated group. Olanzapine-induced reductions in body weight were accompanied by a significant hypophagia during weeks 3 and 4. Risperidone increased body weight during week 1 only and reduced intake of a high fat diet during weeks 3 and 4. Ziprasidone was without effect on indices of body weight and ingestive behaviour. There were no effects of antipsychotic drugs on intra-abdominal fat deposition. Access to a diet high in fat attenuated weight gain induced by olanzapine and risperidone in female rats.

Systematic review and meta-analysis of wound dressings in the prevention of surgical-site infections in surgical wounds healing by primary intention.
BACKGROUND: Postoperative surgical-site infections are a major source of morbidity and cost. This study aimed to identify and present all randomized controlled trial evidence evaluating the effects of dressings on surgical-site infection rates in surgical wounds healing by primary intention; the secondary outcomes included comparisons of pain, scar and acceptability between dressings. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials comparing alternative wound dressings, or wound dressings with leaving wounds exposed for postoperative management of surgical wounds were included in the review regardless of their language. Databases searched included the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register and Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL from inception to May 2011. Two authors performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction, including an assessment of surgical contamination according to the surgical procedure. Where levels of clinical and statistical heterogeneity permitted, data were pooled for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Sixteen controlled trials with 2594 participants examining a range of wound contamination levels were included. They were all unclear or at high risk of bias. There was no evidence that any dressing significantly reduced surgical-site infection rates compared with any other dressing or leaving the wound exposed. Furthermore, no significant differences in pain, scarring or acceptability were seen between the dressings. CONCLUSION: No difference in surgical-site infection rates was demonstrated between surgical wounds covered with different dressings and those left uncovered. No difference was seen in pain, scar or acceptability between dressings.

DisClose: Discovering Colossal Closed Itemsets from High Dimensional Datasets via a Compact Row-Tree
Data mining is an essential part of knowledge discovery, and performs the extraction of useful information from a collection of data, so as to assist human beings in making necessary decisions. This thesis describes research in the field of itemset mining, which performs the extraction of a set of items that occur together in a dataset, based on a user specified threshold. Recent focus of itemset mining has been on the discovery of closed itemsets from high-dimensional datasets, characterised by relatively few rows and a relatively larger number of columns. A closed itemset is the maximal set of items common to a set of rows. By exponentially increasing running time as the average row length increases, mining closed itemsets from such datasets renders most column enumeration-based algorithm impractical. Existing row enumeration-based algorithms also show that they struggle to reach large cardinality closed itemsets. This is due to the implementation of the support constraint, which is based on the frequency of occurrence of the itemset. Frequent closed itemsets are usually smaller in size and larger in numbers, hence taking much of the memory space. Unfortunately, large cardinality closed itemsets are likely to be more informative than small cardinality closed itemsets in this type of dataset. 	The research investigates the area of large cardinality closed itemset discovery by examining and analysing the literature and identifying both strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches. Based on this synthesis, a new algorithm, termed DisClose, has been designed and developed to discover large cardinality (colossal) closed itemsets from high-dimensional datasets. The algorithm strategy begins by enumerating large cardinality itemsets and from these, builds smaller itemsets. This is done by applying a bottom-up search of the row-enumeration tree. A minimum cardinality threshold has been proposed to identify colossal closed itemsets and to further reduce the search space. A novel closedness-checking method has been proposed which uses a unique generator to immediately discover closed itemsets without the need to check if each new closed itemset has previously been found. These approaches have been combined using a Compact Row-Tree (CR-Tree) data structure designed to assist in the efficient discovery of the colossal closed itemsets. For evaluation purposes four state-of-the-art algorithms have been selected for comparison. Experimental results show that algorithm DisClose is scalable and can efficiently extract colossal closed itemsets in the considered dataset, even for low support thresholds that existing algorithms cannot find.

Learning strategies in interpreting text: From comprehension to illustration
<p>Learning strategies can be described as behaviours and thoughts a learner engages in during learning that are aimed at gaining knowledge. Learners are, to use Mayer’s (1996) constructivist definition, ‘sense makers’. We can therefore position this to mean that, if learners are sense makers, then learning strategies are essentially cognitive processes used when learners are striving to make sense out of newly presented material. This paper intends to demonstrate that such thoughts and behaviours can be made explicit and that students can co-ordinate the basic cognitive processes of selecting, organising and integrating. I will discuss two learning strategies which were developed during three cycles of an action research enquiry with a group of illustration students. While each cycle had its own particular structure and aims, the main task, that of illustrating a passage of expository text into an illustration was a constant factor. The first learning strategy involved assisting students develop ‘macropropositions’—personal understandings of the gist or essence of a text (Louwerse and Graesser, 2006; Armbruster, Anderson and Ostertag,  1987; Van Dijk & Kintsch, 1983). The second learning strategy used a form of induction categorised as analogical reasoning (Holyoak, 2005; Sloman and Lagnado, 2005). Both strategies were combined to illustrate the expository text extract. The data suggests that design students benefit from a structured approach to learning, where thinking processes and approaches can be identified and accessible for other learning situations.  The research methodology is based on semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, developmental design (including student notes) and final design output. All student names used are pseudonyms. The text extract from ‘Through the Magic Door’ an essay Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, (1907) has been included as it provides context to analysis outcomes, student comments and design outputs.

Luminescence, between 3 and 4 mu m, was observed for all samples, with good agreement between the measured and calculated peak emission energies. Analysis of the temperature dependence of the luminescence suggests that population of excited quantum well hole subbands occurs at high temperature, leading to a reduction in the PL signal. Room temperature luminescence was obtained from a sample with similar to 0.8% strain in the quantum wells.

Characterization of Cement Microstructure for the Immobilization of Nuclear Waste Using Advanced Imaging Methods
A range of advanced imaging techniques have been brought together to provide a comprehensive picture of cement microstructure for nuclear waste immobilization. Image analysis of Nirex Reference Vault Backfill (NRVB) has been used to characterize the Calcium-Silicate-Hydrate (C-S-H) matrix fraction. Through weight loss measurements and digital image correlation of OPC-based cement blends we have quantified the development of microstructure surface strains during the initial 48 hrs hardening period. The build-up of displacements on the microstructure scale indicated grain-like compressive areas, surrounded by a network of tensile regions. Serial sectioning of NRVB using ultra-microtome cutting has been explored for advanced high-resolution 3D microstructure characterization, while X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) has been used to obtain information of the 3-D pore space and size distribution of air pores in NRVB non-destructively.

The role of contractile unit reorganisation in force generation in airway smooth muscle
Airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells undergo remodelling and reside in a tissue structure that is subject to heterogenous stress distributions that change dynamically during the breathing cycle. In this paper, we develop a structural model of an ASM cell that consists of contractile units (actin and myosin filaments) in series and parallel, anchored to a nonlinearly elastic cytoskeleton. We mimic a typical experimental protocol that involves isometric force generation through triggering of the contractile machinery, followed by oscillatory length fluctuation of the cell. We use the model to predict the effect of a single instance of rearrangement of the contractile machinery, combined with strain-stiffening of the cytoskeleton, on the force generated by the sarcomeres, and the total force generated by the cell. By linking intra-cellular events to whole-cell behaviour, the model reveals mechanistic relationships between structural properties and cell-level force–length loops. We show how contractile force, shortening velocity and sarcomere operating lengths vary as the internal cell architecture is altered. Additionally, we show how interactions between the internal contractile machinery and cytoskeletal structure play a role in the regulation of force generation and hysteresis of the cell.

used to define a tracer age which measures the elapsed time since a water parcel was
resident in the surface mixed layer. A principle finding is that the observed tracer
age shows a large and systematic change over time. Tritium-3He age in the eastern
Atlantic thermocline is seen to increase over time; the magnitude of the change is
greatest for the deeper, more slowly ventilated layers of the thermocline.
The first hypothesis examined is that the observed shift in the tracer age field
is the manifestation of a slackening of the physical ventilation. A time series of the
meridional geostrophic velocity shear in the eastern Atlantic shows no indication of a
change in the strength of the large-scale circulation. Uncertainty of the geostrophic
calculation due to data sparsity and mesoscale eddy contamination prevents conclusive
rejection of the hypothesis of a changing circulation. There are other tracers which
offer useful clues: comparison of the tritium-3He age field with dissolved oxygen
reveals a temporal trend in the property-property correlation. The spatial structure of
the oxygen field, however, shows no long-term evolution over time. From this line of
evidence it is concluded that the physical ventilation of the thermocline has not altered
over time and, therefore, the temporal change in the tritium-3He age field must be the
signal of the tritium invasion itself. A second hypothesis, which analysis shows is more consistent with the observations,
is that the changing tracer age is a consequence of mixing effects in the
ventilation of 3He and tritium. Numerical simulations of the thermocline ventilation of
3H and 3He are performed to examine the steadiness of the tracer age field under different
advective-diffusive regimes. A one-dimensional model is constructed based on the assumption that the totality of the fluid in the thermocline derives from subduction
out of the surface mixed layer. The temporal behavior of the tracer age field is found
to be dependent on the radiotracer Peclet number, which measures the ratio of the
diffusive and advective time scales. In a model with steady circulation, the observed
temporal behavior of the tracer age field can be reproduced only when the effects of
lateral mixing play a significant role in the process of ventilation. The vertical structure
and magnitude of the implied lateral diffusivity are, however, inconsistent with
other observations. The numerical simulations are next extended to two-dimensions
to allow for the presence of a pool of unventilated, re-circulated water within the
anti-cyclonic, subtropical gyre. Comparison of the model with the observed transient
tracer field in the lower thermocline shows consistency with conventional estimates of
lateral mixing rates only when the diffusively ventilated "pool" region extends across
the entire zonal domain of the gyre. In contrast, the transient tracer fields in the upper
portion of the thermocline are best reproduced when the isopycnal surfaces are ventilated
by advection directly from the surface mixed layer. The results obtained here
are consistent with numerical simulations which reveal a prominent role for mesoscale
eddies in the ventilation of the thermocline.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution September 1997This research was supported by Office of Naval Research AASERT contract

Reliability and validity of a new measure of patient satisfaction with out of hours primary medical care in the United Kingdom: development of a patient questionnaire.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a reliable, valid measure of patient satisfaction with out of hours care suitable for large scale service evaluation. DESIGN: Focus group meetings and semistructured interviews with patients to identify issues of importance to patients and possible questionnaire items; interviews and two pilot studies to test and identify new questionnaire items; modification or removal of items to eliminate ambiguity and reduce non-response and skewed responses; questionnaire survey of out of hours care. SETTING: Greater Manchester and Leicester. SUBJECTS: 11 general practice patients participated in the focus groups and 28 in the semistructured interviews; 41 in the preliminary interviews; 41 and 378 in the postal pilots; and 1466 in the survey of out of hours care. RESULTS: A 32 item questionnaire was developed. Component analysis indicated seven scales (satisfaction with communication and management, doctor's attitude, continuity of care, delay until visit, access to out of hours care, initial contact person, telephone advice) related to overall satisfaction and containing issues identified as important to patients. Levels of reliability were satisfactory, Cronbach's alpha correlation coefficient exceeding 0.60 for all scales. CONCLUSION: A reliable, valid measure of patient satisfaction has been developed, suitable for large scale evaluation of out of hours care.

A longitudinal investigation of posttraumatic stress disorder in patients with ovarian cancer.
INTRODUCTION: Exposure to the aggressive and life-threatening nature of ovarian cancer and its treatment is potentially traumatic. However, little is known about the occurrence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in these patients. METHODS: A total of 121 women newly diagnosed with ovarian cancer were recruited into a prospective longitudinal study of the course of PTSD and the factors that predict its development and persistence. Between 82 and 111 were assessed at each of the four time points subsequent to their diagnosis, and 63 women provided complete data from the beginning of chemotherapy treatment, midtreatment, end of treatment and 3-months follow-up on PTSD. RESULTS: Between 36% and 45% of the total sample experienced PTSD at some point, with a nonsignificant but progressive increase in prevalence over time. Of those women with complete data, only 30% never experienced PTSD at any time. Most of the women were intermittent cases of PTSD (57%, n=36), while 13% (n=8) were persistent cases. Younger women were at higher risk of experiencing PTSD. DISCUSSION: The prevalence of women newly diagnosed with ovarian cancer with persistent PTSD is relatively low (13%); however, our findings highlight that the trajectory of the illness and its associated stressors may constitute an enormous challenge and may be perceived as traumatic and stressful for most of the women in our sample at least once. Repetitive screening for PTSD and the provision of psychological treatments could ameliorate PTSD symptoms.

Identification of Arhgap28, a New Regulator of Stress Fibre Formation in Cells Assembling a Fibrous Extracellular Matrix
Discovery of Arhgap28, a Molecule Involved in Controlling Cell Forces Important in Making a Strong TendonMovements of the body such as running or gripping a door handle require strong tissue types such as muscle, bone, tendon, ligament and cartilage. These tissues make up the musculoskeletal system. Their ability to transmit and withstand mechanical loading is because of a rope-like protein called collagen, which surrounds the cells. Collagen is important as it allows tissues of the body to endure the constant forces of being pulled, pushed and squashed. In bone tissue, these fibrils are woven together to allow calcium to bind, which creates strong bone that can bear the weight of the body. The collagen ropes or ‘fibrils’ in tendon are bundled together like a rope so that tendons can be stretched repetitively without breaking. How the collagen fibrils are organised is linked to the function of the tissue. A disadvantage of having such a unique and strong tissue structure is that once damaged, the collagen fibrils do not fully repair, often resulting in poor healing and long-term recovery. It is estimated that the annual cost of tendon injury in the UK is £25 billion. Scientists led by Professor Karl Kadler at the University of Manchester want to understand how organisation of collagen fibrils is established during the formation of musculoskeletal tissues, so that new medical treatments to improve tissue healing may be developed. As a starting point, the scientists began studying tendon tissue. Since 2004, they have discovered that the cells that live in tendon are responsible for organising the collagen fibrils into non-crisscrossing, straight strands. They found that the cell scaffolding plays important roles in the organisation of collagen fibrils and in generating pulling forces used to make tendons strong. This PhD project investigated the idea that the organisation of the scaffolding inside the cell is responsible for determining the arrangement of the collagen fibrils outside the cell. Scientists found a gene called Arhgap28 that is more prevalent in cells when they make tendon tissues. Experiments showed that Arhgap28 could prevent the cell scaffolding from generating pulling forces. Scientists now think that Arhgap28 controls how the cell is able to touch and pull on fibrils so that they can be arranged correctly and produce a tissue that is not too stiff and not too loose. Further understanding of Arhgap28 would pave the way for improved therapeutics for musculoskeletal injuries in the future.

Least Squares Temporal Difference Methods: An Analysis under General Conditions
We consider approximate policy evaluation for finite state and action Markov decision processes (MDP) with the least squares temporal difference (LSTD) algorithm, LSTD($\lambda$), in an exploration-enhanced learning context, where policy costs are computed from observations of a Markov chain different from the one corresponding to the policy under evaluation. We establish for the discounted cost criterion that LSTD($\lambda$) converges almost surely under mild, minimal conditions. We also analyze other properties of the iterates involved in the algorithm, including convergence in mean and boundedness. Our analysis draws on theories of both finite space Markov chains and weak Feller Markov chains on a topological space. Our results can be applied to other temporal difference algorithms and MDP models. As examples, we give a convergence analysis of a TD($\lambda$) algorithm and extensions to MDP with compact state and action spaces, as well as a convergence proof of a new LSTD algorithm with state-dependent $\lambda$-parameters.

<p>New sub-mu s isomers have been observed in the neutron-rich Sn isotopes. Sn-125,Sn-127,Sn-129 nuclei have been produced in a relativistic fission reaction of U-238 on a Be-9 target at 750 A.MeV and by the fragmentation of Xe-136 at 600 A.MeV populating high-spin yrast states. In addition to the already known mu s isomers, three new ones with sub-mu s half-lives have been observed. These yrast isomers are the high-spin members of the nu(d(3/2)(-1)h(11/2)(-2)) and nu h(11/2)(-n), seniority v = 3 multiplets leading to isomeric (23/2(+)) and (27/2(-)) states, respectively. Added to the already known 19/2(+)mu s isomers in this region the current work completes the systematic information of neutron-hole excitations toward the filling of the last h(11/2) orbital at N = 82.

Estimate of the number of patients eligible for treatment with drotrecogin alfa (activated) based on differing international indications: post-hoc analysis of an inception cohort study in Australia and New Zealand.
We aimed to estimate the potential number of patients eligible for treatment with drotrecogin alfa (activated) when applying different international criteria. The study was a post-hoc analysis of inception cohort study of 691 patients with severe sepsis during 5878 consecutive intensive care unit admission episodes in 23 closed multi-disciplinary ICUs of 21 hospitals (16 tertiary and 5 university-affiliated) in Australia and New Zealand. Outcomes assessed were presence of contraindications to treatment with drotrecogin alfa (activated), an admission APACHE II score of 25 or greater and dysfunction of two or more organs. During 5878 consecutive intensive care admission episodes, 691 patients had severe sepsis, 553 (80.0%, 95% CI 77.0-83.0%) had no relative or absolute contraindication, 64 (9.3%, 7.1-11.4%) had a relative contraindication and 74 (10.7%, 8.4-13.0%) had an absolute contraindication. Two hundred and six patients (3.5%, 3.0-4.0%) had an APACHE II score of 25 or greater, 452 (7.7%, 7.0-8.4%) had dysfunction of two or more organs, 469 (8.0%, 7.3-8.7%) had either dysfunction of two or more organs or an APACHE II score of 25 or greater Relatively few patients had an absolute contraindication to treatment with drotrecogin alfa (activated). Selection based on the APACHE II score results in fewer eligible patients than selection based on multiple organ dysfunction. Depending on the selection criteria used, for every hundred admissions to intensive care, between 3.5 and 8.0 of patients may be eligible for treatment with drotrecogin alfa (activated).

Genetic variants in the catechol-o-methyltransferase gene are associated with impulsivity and executive function: Relevance for major depression.
The catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) gene has been extensively investigated in depression with somewhat contradictory results but the role of impulsivity, as a possible intermediate phenotype in this disorder, has not been considered yet. In our study, four tagging SNPs in the COMT gene (rs933271, rs740603, rs4680, rs4646316) were genotyped in two independent population cohorts: Manchester (n = 1267) and Budapest (n = 942). First, we investigated the association between COMT genotypes, impulsivity, neuroticism and depression using haplotype trend regression, and constructed a model using structural equation modeling to investigate the interaction between these factors. Secondly, we tested the effect of executive function on this model in a smaller interviewed sample (n = 207). Our results demonstrated that COMT haplotypes were significantly associated with impulsivity in the combined cohort, showing the same direction of effects in both populations. The COMT effect on depressive symptoms (in subjects without history of depression) and on executive function (interviewed sample) showed the opposite pattern to impulsivity. Structural equation models demonstrated that COMT and impulsivity acted, both together (through neuroticism) and independently, to increase the risk of depression. In addition, better executive function also operated as a risk factor for depression, possibly though reduced ability to flexibly disengage negative emotions. In conclusion, variations in the COMT gene exert complex effects on susceptibility to depression involving various intermediate phenotypes, such as impulsivity and executive function. These findings emphasise that modeling of disease pathways at phenotypic level are valuable for identifying genetic risk factors. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

“Six sessions is a drop in the ocean”: an exploratory study of neurological  physiotherapy in idiopathic and inherited ataxias
Objective An exploratory study to examine specialist neurological physiotherapy service provision and utilisation for people with progressive
ataxia.

Design Qualitative study involving thematic analysis of accounts in semi-structured interviews with physiotherapists and patients.

Setting People with ataxia and specialist neuro-rehabilitation physiotherapists in Greater Manchester, UK.

Participants 38 people with ataxia and 8 neurological-physiotherapists working in academic and hospital and community-based services in
NHS and private settings. Recruiting physiotherapists experienced in working with the patient group was a challenge.

Interventions One hour cross-sectional semi-structured interview at physiotherapists’ workplaces or in patients’ own homes.

Results Neurological physiotherapy was experienced by 25 (66%) of the 38 people with ataxia. The overarching themes emerging from the
analysis were ‘making a difference,’ engagement and service provision. A majority of both samples felt that services should be organised
so as to provide longer term therapy and support that goes beyond short care packages followed by provision of home exercise programme.
Engagement with services was linked to patient expectations, adherence and perception of outcomes. The most predominant codes in the
data set were encapsulated by the theme ‘making a difference,’ which further included concerns about how to measure perceived clinical
improvement (as experienced by patients) in the context of progressive decline.

Conclusions The findings suggest a model of idealised service provision involving a holistic, open-access service including research efforts
to improve the evidence base. Special attention needs to be paid to measuring improvements following therapy.

THE PERFORMANCE OF A NUCLEAR FUEL-MATRIX MATERIAL IN A SEALED CO2 SYSTEM
An advanced concept high temperature reactor (HTR) design has been proposed - The ‘U-Battery’, which utilises a unique sealed coolant loop, and is intended to operate with minimal human oversight. In order to reduce the need for moving parts within the design, CO2 has been selected as a candidate coolant, potentially allowing a naturally circulated system.HTR fuel is held within a semi-graphitic fuel-matrix material, and this has not previously been tested within a CO2 environment. Graphite in CO2 is subject to two oxidation reactions, one thermally driven and one radiolytically. As such, the oxi- dation performance of fuel-matrix material has been tested within CO2 at both high temperatures and under ionising radiation within a sealed-system.Performance has been compared to that of the Gilsocarbon and NBG-18 nuclear graphite grades. Gilsocarbon is the primary graphite grade used within the currently operating AGR fleet within the UK, and as such is known to have acceptable oxidation performance under reactor conditions. NBG-18 is a modern graphite grade, and is a candidate material for use within the U-Battery. Virgin characterisation of all materi- als was performed, including measurements of bulk mass and volume, skeletal volumes and surface areas. High-resolution optical microscopy has also been performed and pore size distributions inferred from digital image analysis. All results were seen to agree well with literature values, and the variation between samples has been quanti- fied and found to be < 10% between samples of Gilsocarbon, and < 4% for samples of fuel-matrix and NBG-18.Thermal performance of fuel-matrix material was observed between 600 ◦C – 1200 ◦C and seen to be broadly comparable to that of the nuclear graphite grades tested. NBG-18 showed surprisingly poor performance at 600◦C, with an oxidation rate of 3×10−4%/min, approximately ten times faster than Gilsocarbon in similar conditions, and three times faster than fuel-matrix material. The radiolytic oxidation performance of fuel-matrix material and NBG-18 has been observed by irradiating sealed quartz ampoules. Ampoules were pressurised with CO2 prior to irradiation, and the pres- sure after 30 days of irradiation was measured and seen to fall by 50%. Radiolytic oxidation, and the subsequent radiolysis of the reaction product, CO, was seen to cause significant carbonaceous deposition on the internal surfaces of the ampoule and throughout the samples. Due to the short irradiation times available in the present study, an investigation of the microporosity within irradiated samples has been carried out, using nitrogen adsorption and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). Pore size distributions produced from SANS show the closure of microporosity within NBG-18, most likely as a result of low-temperature neutron irradiation.As a result of this work, CO2 is no longer a candidate coolant for use with the U-Battery design, due to the rapid deposition observed following irradiation.

A role for syndecan-1 in coupling fascin spike formation by thrombospondin-1.
An important role of cell matrix adhesion receptors is to mediate transmembrane coupling between extracellular matrix attachment, actin reorganization, and cell spreading. Thrombospondin (TSP)-1 is a modulatory component of matrix expressed during development, immune response, or wound repair. Cell adhesion to TSP-1 involves formation of biochemically distinct matrix contacts based on stable fascin spikes. The cell surface adhesion receptors required have not been identified. We report here that antibody clustering of syndecan-1 proteoglycan specifically transduces organization of cortical actin and fascin bundles in several cell types. Transfection of COS-7 cells with syndecan-1 is sufficient to stimulate cell spreading, fascin spike assembly, and extensive protrusive lateral ruffling on TSP-1 or on syndecan-1 antibody. The underlying molecular mechanism depends on glycosaminoglycan (GAG) modification of the syndecan-1 core protein at residues S45 or S47 for cell membrane spreading and on the VC2 region of the cytoplasmic domain for spreading and fascin spike formation. Expression of the VC2 deletion mutant or GAG-negative syndecan-1 showed that syndecan-1 is necessary in spreading and fascin spike formation by C2C12 cells on TSP-1. These results establish a novel role for syndecan-1 protein in coupling a physiological matrix ligand to formation of a specific matrix contact structure.

A multi-dimensional spectral description of ocean variability with applications
Efforts to monitor the ocean for signs of climate change are hampered by ever-present
noise, in the form of stochastic ocean variability, and detailed knowledge of the character
of this noise is necessary for estimating the significance of apparent trends. Typically,
uncertainty estimates are made by a variety of ad hoc methods, often based on
numerical model results or the variability of the data set being analyzed. We provide
a systematic approach based on the four-dimensional frequency-wavenumber spectrum
of low-frequency ocean variability. This thesis presents an empirical model of
the spectrum of ocean variability for periods between about 20 days and 15 years and
wavelengths of about 200{10,000 km, and describes applications to ocean circulation
trend detection, observing system design, and satellite data processing.
The horizontal wavenumber-frequency part of the model spectrum is based on
satellite altimetry, current meter data, moored temperature records, and shipboard
ADCP data. The spectrum is dominated by motions along a "nondispersive line".
The observations considered are consistent with a universal ω-2 power law at the
high end of the frequency range, but inconsistent with a universal wavenumber power
law. The model spectrum is globally varying and accounts for changes in dominant
phase speed, period, and wavelength with location. The vertical structure of the
model spectrum is based on numerical model results, current meter data, and theoretical
considerations. We  find that the vertical structure of kinetic energy is surface
intensified relative to the simplest theoretical predictions. We present a theory for
the interaction of linear Rossby waves with rough topography; rough topography can
explain both the observed phase speeds and vertical structure of variability. The
improved description of low-frequency ocean variability presented here will serve as
a useful tool for future oceanographic studies.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution February 2013This research was supported by NASA under grants

Loss of compartmentalization causes misregulation of lysine biosynthesis in peroxisome-deficient yeast cells
To characterize the metabolic role of peroxisomes in yeast cells under physiological conditions, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of published microarray data. Previous studies of yeast peroxisomes have mainly been focused on the function of peroxisomes under extreme conditions, such as growth on oleate or methanol as the sole carbon source, and may therefore not be representative of the normal physiological role of yeast peroxisomes. Surprisingly, our analysis of the microarray data reveals that the only pathway responding to peroxisome deficiency in mid-log phase is lysine biosynthesis, whereas classical peroxisomal pathways such as beta-oxidation are unaffected. We show that the upregulation of lysine biosynthesis genes in peroxisome-deficient yeasts shares many characteristics with the physiological response to lysine starvation. We provide data that suggest that this is the result of a "pathological" stimulation of the Lys14p transcriptional activator by the pathway intermediate aminoadipate semialdehyde. Mistargeting of the peroxisomal lysine pathway to the cytosol increases the active concentration of aminoadipate semialdehyde, which is no longer contained in the peroxisome and can now activate Lys14p at much lower levels than in wild-type yeasts. This is the first well-documented example of pathway misregulation in response to peroxisome deficiency and will be useful in understanding the phenotypic details of human peroxisome-deficient patients (Zellweger syndrome).

Helicopter Engine Inlet Barrier Filter Design
This contribution concerns the design of Intake Barrier Filters (IBF) for Helicopters. These protective devices are fitted to the engine intakes of helicopters to prevent sand and dust reaching the engine during operations in dusty environments. Their design is dependent on and unique to the rotorcraft to which they are fitted, and can be optimised for minimum pressure drop and maximum service life accordingly by tuning the filter geometry. Three main constraints govern the design of IBF. They are: 1) Intake architecture; 2) Engine mass flow; 3) Particle size distribution of local dust. The filter is a pleated multi-ply fabric. By changing the fold depth and pitch, the filter can be optimised to perform at minimum pressure drop and maximum particle capture capacity for a given constraint set. It is found that the latter of these favours fifty percent more filter folds for optimum performance.

Amorphous carbon is an excellent candidate for both the well and barrier layers of the superlattices, leading to a fast and reliable device manufacturing process. We show theoretically and experimentally that, using low energy-loss spatially resolved spectroscopy, we can characterize the component layers of a superlattice. We measure quantum confinement of the electron wave function in the superlattice's wells and calculate the effective tunneling mass for amorphous carbon superlattices as m(*)=0.067m(e). This effective mass makes diamondlike carbon films as feasible candidate for electronic devices.</p>

Use of a Molecular Decoy to Segregate Transport from Antigenicity in the FrpB Iron Transporter from Neisseria meningitidis.
FrpB is an outer membrane transporter from , the causative agent of meningococcal meningitis. It is a member of the TonB-dependent transporter (TBDT) family and is responsible for iron uptake into the periplasm. FrpB is subject to a high degree of antigenic variation, principally through a region of hypervariable sequence exposed at the cell surface. From the crystal structures of two FrpB antigenic variants, we identify a bound ferric ion within the structure which induces structural changes on binding which are consistent with it being the transported substrate. Binding experiments, followed by elemental analysis, verified that FrpB binds Fe with high affinity. EPR spectra of the bound Fe ion confirmed that its chemical environment was consistent with that observed in the crystal structure. Fe binding was reduced or abolished on mutation of the Fe-chelating residues. FrpB orthologs were identified in other Gram-negative bacteria which showed absolute conservation of the coordinating residues, suggesting the existence of a specific TBDT sub-family dedicated to the transport of Fe. The region of antigenic hypervariability lies in a separate, external sub-domain, whose structure is conserved in both the F3-3 and F5-1 variants, despite their sequence divergence. We conclude that the antigenic sub-domain has arisen separately as a result of immune selection pressure to distract the immune response from the primary transport function. This would enable FrpB to function as a transporter independently of antibody binding, by using the antigenic sub-domain as a 'molecular decoy' to distract immune surveillance.

Prediction of missed proteolytic cleavages for the selection of surrogate peptides for quantitative proteomics.
Abstract Quantitative proteomics experiments are usually performed using proteolytic peptides as surrogates for their parent proteins, inferring protein amounts from peptide-level quantitation. This process is frequently dependent on complete digestion of the parent protein to its limit peptides so that their signal is truly representative. Unfortunately, proteolysis is often incomplete, and missed cleavage peptides are frequently produced that are unlikely to be optimal surrogates for quantitation, particularly for label-mediated approaches seeking to derive absolute values. We have generated a predictive computational tool that is able to predict which candidate proteolytic peptide bonds are likely to be missed by the standard enzyme trypsin. Our cross-validated prediction tool uses support vector machines and achieves high accuracy in excess of 0.94 precision (PPV), with attendant high sensitivity of 0.79, across multiple proteomes. We believe this is a useful tool for selecting candidate quantotypic peptides, seeking to minimize likely loss owing to missed cleavage, which will be a boon for quantitative proteomic pipelines as well as other areas of proteomics. Our results are discussed in the context of recent results examining the kinetics of missed cleavages in proteomic digestion protocols, and show agreement with observed experimental trends.

In particular, poorly performing large banks see an increase in spreads of 25 basis points, but are borrowing 1% less, on average. Worse performing banks do not hoard liquidity. While the interbank market does not freeze entirely, it does not seem to expand to meet latent demand.

Proteomic analysis of leukaemogenic protein tyrosine kinase action
Introduction: Chronic myeloid leukaemia is a blood cancer which progresses from a chronic phase to an acute blast crisis if untreated. Disease progression and treatment resistance may be precipitated by the mutator action of BCR/ABL protein tyrosine kinase (PTK), but only few protein phosphosites involved in the DNA damage response have been investigated with respect to BCR/ABL action.Aim: The aim of this PhD project was to demonstrate that BCR/ABL PTK expression can affect the response to genotoxic stress signalling at the protein phosphorylation level.Methodology: Etoposide-induced DNA damage response has been studied in control and BCR/ABL PTK-expressing Ba/F3 cells using apoptosis and γH2AX assays. Quantitative phosphoproteomics was performed with iTRAQ™ peptide labelling to discover putative modulated phosphorylation sites. Absolute quantification (AQUA™) performed with selected reaction monitoring was used to validate discovery phosphoproteomics. The effect of genotoxic stress on the THO complex protein Thoc5/Fmip was studied using western blots.Results: The expression of BCR/ABL PTK induced γH2AX phosphorylation after etoposide exposure. This was associated with the modulation of H2AX tyrosine 142 phosphorylation, MDC1 (serines 595 and 1053) and Hemogen serine 380 phosphorylation among proteins regulated by both BCR/ABL PTK and etoposide. We identified that leukaemogenic PTKs mediate Thoc5/Fmip phosphorylation on tyrosine 225 via Src proto-oncogene and oxidative stress, while ATM and MEK1/2 may control its phosphorylation. Human CD34+ CD38- leukaemic stem cells showed pronounced level of THOC5/FMIP tyrosine phosphorylation. Expression of phosphomutant Thoc5/Fmip Y225F might reduce apoptosis mediated by etoposide and H2O2.Conclusion: BCR/ABL PTK can sustain, create, block and change the intensity of protein phosphorylation related to genotoxic stress. Modulation of H2AX, MDC1, Hemogen and Thoc5/Fmip post-translational modifications by BCR/ABL PTK might promote unfaithful DNA repair, genomic instability, anti-apoptotic signalling or abnormal cell differentiation, resulting in leukaemia progression.

[bag-1, hsc70, peptide, interaction, helix]

Short peptides derived from the BAG-1 C-terminus inhibit the interaction between BAG-1 and HSC70 and decrease breast cancer cell growth.
BAG-1, a multifunctional protein, interacts with a plethora of cellular targets where the interaction with HSC70 and HSP70, is considered vital. Structural studies have demonstrated the C-terminal of BAG-1 forms a bundle of three alpha-helices of which helices 2 and 3 are directly involved in binding to the chaperones. Here we found peptides derived from helices 2 and 3 of BAG-1 interfered with BAG-1:HSC70 binding. We confirmed that a 12 amino-acid peptide from helix 2 directly interacted with HSC70 and when introduced into MCF-7 and ZR-75-1 cells, these peptides inhibited their growth. In conclusion, we have identified a small domain within BAG-1 which appears to play a critical role in the interaction with HSC70.

[gene, study, xenopus, embryo, function, method, knockdown]

Reverse genetic studies using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides.
Here we present a protocol, which allows loss-of-function studies in Xenopus embryos using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs). Gene knockdown studies provide a critical method for assessing gene function in vitro and in vivo. Such studies are currently performed in Xenopus using primarily one of the two main methods: (1) overexpression of dominant negative constructs or (2) inhibition of gene function by using MOs targeting either the initiation of translation or mRNA splicing. While a dominant negative approach is very effective, it often suffers from specificity. Given that MOs target very specific nucleotide sequences in the target RNA, it suffers considerably less from issues of specificity. The most convenient method for introducing MOs into embryos is through microinjection, which is a simple procedure. Therefore, a reverse genetics approach in Xenopus using MOs is an extremely powerful tool to study gene function, particularly when taking advantage of available sequence data in the post-genomic era. Furthermore, given the well-established fate map in Xenopus, it is also very easy to generate mosaic knockdown embryos, where the gene of interest is affected in defined regions of the embryo. Finally it should be noted that MOs can also be used to block miRNA function and processing, so that it provides a convenient method to not only perform gene knockdown studies on protein coding genes, but also noncoding genes. The protocol we describe here is for both Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis.

[azole, gene, insertion, action]

Identification of novel genes conferring altered azole susceptibility                    in Aspergillus fumigatus.
Azoles are currently the mainstay of antifungal treatment both in                        agricultural and in clinical settings. Although the target site of azole                        action is well studied, the basis of azole resistance and the ultimate mode                        of action of the drug in fungi are poorly understood. To gain a deeper                        insight into these aspects of azole action, restriction-mediated plasmid                        integration (REMI) was used to create azole sensitive and resistant strains                        of the clinically important fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. Four azole                        sensitive insertions and four azole-resistant insertions were characterized.                        Three phenotypes could be re-created in wild-type AF210 by reintegration of                        rescued plasmid and a further four could be confirmed by complementation of                        the mutant phenotype with a copy of the wild-type gene predicted to be                        disrupted by the original insertional event. Six insertions were in genes                        not previously associated with azole sensitivity or resistance. Two                        insertions occur in transporter genes that may affect drug efflux, whereas                        others may affect transcriptional regulation of sterol biosynthesis genes                        and NADH metabolism in the mitochondrion. Two insertions are in genes of                        unknown function.

[navigation, match, vehicle, gate, uncertainty]

Terrain-relative navigation for autonomous underwater vehicles
Navigation is a key technology for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and
currently, it limits potential and existing vehicle capabilities and applications. This thesis
presents a terrain-relative navigation system for AUVs that does not require the
deployment of acoustic beacons or other navigational aids, but instead depends on a
supplied digital bathymetric map and the ability of the vehicle to image the seafloor.
At each time step, a bathymetric profile is measured and compared to a local region of the
supplied map using a mean absolute difference criterion. The region size is determined by
the current navigation uncertainty. For large regions, a coarse-to-fine algorithm with a
modified beam search is used to intelligently search for good matches while reducing the
computational requirements. A validation gate is defined around the position estimate
using the navigation uncertainty, which is explicitly represented through a covariance
matrix. A probabilistic data association filter with amplitude information (PDAFAI),
grounded in the Kalman Filter framework, probabilistically weights each good match that
lies within the validation gate. Weights are a function of both the match quality and the
size of the innovation. Navigation updates are then a function of the predicted position, the
gate size, all matches within the gate, and the uncertainties on both the prediction and the
matches.
The system was tested in simulation on several terrain types using a deep-ocean
bathymetry map of the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between the Kane and
Atlantis Transforms. Results show more accurate navigation in the areas with greater
bathymetric variability and less accurate navigation in flatter areas with more gentle
terrain contours. In most places, the uncertainties assigned to the navigation positions
reflect the ability of the system to follow the true track. In no case did the navigation
diverge from the true track beyond the point of recovery.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution May 1997Funding was provided by Office of Naval Research Grants N00014-96-1-5028, N00014-94-1-

The dynamic architecture of the metabolic switch in Streptomyces coelicolor
Background: During the lifetime of a fermenter culture, the soil bacterium S. coelicolor undergoes a major metabolic switch from exponential growth to antibiotic production. We have studied gene expression patterns during this switch, using a specifically designed Affymetrix genechip and a high-resolution time-series of fermenter-grown samples.Results: Surprisingly, we find that the metabolic switch actually consists of multiple finely orchestrated switching events. Strongly coherent clusters of genes show drastic changes in gene expression already many hours before the classically defined transition phase where the switch from primary to secondary metabolism was expected. The main switch in gene expression takes only 2 hours, and changes in antibiotic biosynthesis genes are delayed relative to the metabolic rearrangements. Furthermore, global variation in morphogenesis genes indicates an involvement of cell differentiation pathways in the decision phase leading up to the commitment to antibiotic biosynthesis.Conclusions: Our study provides the first detailed insights into the complex sequence of early regulatory events during and preceding the major metabolic switch in S. coelicolor, which will form the starting point for future attempts at engineering antibiotic production in a biotechnological setting. ?? 2010 Nieselt et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Visualising large-scale neural network models in real-time
As models of neural networks scale in concert with increasing computational performance, gaining insight into their operation becomes increasingly important. This paper proposes an efficient and generalised method to access simulation data via in-system aggregation, providing visualised representation at all layers of the network in real-time. Enabling neural networks for real-time visualisation allows a user to gain insight into the network dynamics of their systems as they operate over time. This visibility also permits users (or a computational agent) to determine whether early intervention is required to adjust parameters, or even to terminate operation of experimental networks that are not operating correctly. Conventionally the determination of correctness would occur post-simulation, so with sufficient `in-flight' insight, a significant advantage may be obtained, and compute time minimised. For this paper we apply the real-time visualisation platform to the SpiNNaker programmable neuromimetic system and a variety of neural network models. The visualisation platform is shown to be capable across a range of diverse simulations, and at supporting differing layers of network abstraction, requiring minimal configuration to represent each model. The resulting general-purpose visualisation platform for neural networks, is effective at presenting data to users in order to aid their comprehension of the network dynamics during operation, and scales from small to biologically-significant network sizes.

Identifying and testing candidate genetic polymorphisms in the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): association with TNFSF15 and TNFα
OBJECTIVES: The postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) suggests that impaired resolution of inflammation could cause IBS symptoms. The authors hypothesised that polymorphisms in genes whose expression were altered by gastroenteritis might be linked to IBS with diarrhoea (IBS-D) which closely resembles PI-IBS. DESIGN: Part 1: 25 healthy volunteers (HVs), 21 patients 6 months after Campylobacter jejuni infection, 37 IBS-D and 19 IBS with constipation (IBS-C) underwent rectal biopsy for gene expression analysis and peripheral blood mononuclear cell cytokine production assessment. Part 2: Polymorphisms in genes whose expression was altered in Part 1 were assessed in 179 HV, 179 IBS-D, 122 IBS-C and 41 PI-IBS. RESULTS: Part 1: Mucosal expression of seven genes was altered in IBS: CCL11, CCL13, Calpain 8 and TNFSF15 increased while NR1D1, GPR161 and GABRE decreased with similar patterns after infection with C jejuni. Part 2: The authors assessed 21 known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these seven genes and one SNP in each of the TNFα and IL-10 genes. Three out of five TNFSF15 SNPs (rs6478108, rs6478109 and rs7848647) showed reduced minor allele frequency (MAF) (0.28, 0.27 and 0.27) in subjects with IBS-D compared with HV (0.38, 0.36 and 0.37; p=0.007, 0.015 and 0.007, respectively) confirming others recent findings. The authors also replicated the previously reported association of the TNFα SNP rs1800629 with PI-IBS which showed an increase in the MAF at 0.30 versus 0.19 for HV (p=0.04). CONCLUSION: IBS-D and PI-IBS patients are associated with TNFSF15 and TNFα genetic polymorphisms which also predispose to Crohn's disease suggesting possible common underlying pathogenesis.

Spin Hall and spin-diagonal conductivity in the presence of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling
We investigate the spin-current linear response conductivity tensor to an electric field in a paramagnetic two-dimensional electron gas with both Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling in the weak scattering regime within the Born approximation. In the usual sample parameters, and for cross-sectional size smaller than the spin-coherence length, the spin-Hall conductivity depends only on the sign of the difference in magnitude of the Rashba and Dresselhaus coupling except within a narrow window where both coupling strengths are equal. We also find that a spin current is generated in the direction of the driving field for a non-zero Dresselhaus term. Possible experimental setups for its detection, taking into account the finite mobility and typical parameters of current samples, are discussed.

Development of a Pummerer–type cyclisation for the synthesis of analogues of the anti-tumour natural product ecteinascidin 597
A connective Pummerer reaction was developed with a view to its use in the synthesis of analogues of ecteinascidin 597, a member of a family of potent anti-tumour natural products. A one-step synthesis of N-benzyl 2-hydroxyamides, involving the reaction of 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-one with amines, was investigated and the products were oxidised to give glyoxamides. Reaction conditions were optimised for the cyclisation of electron-rich N-benzyl glyoxamides in the presence of thiols and a Lewis acid (ZnCl2 or Sc(OTf)3) to give 4-sulfanyltetrahydroisoquinolinones, and mechanistic studies indicated the importance of hemithioacetal and thionium intermediates in these reactions. The scope of the reaction was found to encompass electron-rich N-benzyl pyruvamide substrates, which gave 4-methyl-4-sulfanyltetrahydroisoquinolinone products via what is believed to be a combination of thionium ion and cyclisation-substitution pathways. Under more forcing conditions, connective Pummerer cyclisation of N-benzyl 2,2-diethoxyacetamides was successful.Sharpless asymmetric aminohydroxylation and a Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation-Mitsunobu sequence were exploited in the synthesis of an enantioenriched 1,2-aminoalcohol. Subsequent conversion to branched, N-benzyl 2-hydroxyacetamides by PMB and silyl protection and N-acylation then oxidation and cyclisation furnished 1-silyloxymethyl-4-sulfanyl tetrahydroisoquinolinones. Modification of these tetrahydroisoquinolinones gave bridged macrolactones which map onto the A subunit of the ecteinascidins. A one-pot macrolactone synthesis using a connective Pummerer reaction was unsuccessfully attempted on a substrate bearing 2,2-diethoxyacetamide and thiol moiety in addition to an electron-rich benzene ring. A new protecting group strategy was necessary for continuation of the analogue synthesis and a variety of N,O-acetals were evaluated for the protection of the 1,2-aminoalcohol.

Longitudinal evaluation of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Huntington's disease.
A group of 111 patients with Huntington's disease (HD) underwent a minimum of three annual neuropsychiatric assessments, using the Problem Behaviors Assessment for Huntington's Disease (PBA-HD). Longitudinal prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms was notably higher than baseline prevalence, suggesting that previous studies may have underestimated the extent of this clinical problem. Moreover, apathy, irritability, and depression were each associated with distinct longitudinal profiles. Apathy progressed over time and across disease stages. Irritability also increased significantly, but only in early stages of HD. Depression did not increase significantly at any stage of disease. The neuropsychiatric syndrome of apathy appears to be intrinsic to the evolution and progression of HD.

The development of personalised therapy and mechanism-targeted agents in oncology mandates the identification of the patient populations most likely to benefit from therapy. This paper discusses the increasing evidence as to the heterogeneity of the group of diseases called colorectal cancer. Differences in the aetiology and epidemiology of proximal and distal cancers are reflected in different clinical behaviour, histopathology, and molecular characteristics of these tumours. This may impact response both to standard cytotoxic therapies and mechanism-targeted agents. This disease heterogeneity leads to challenges in the design of clinical trials to assess novel therapies in the treatment of "colorectal cancer."

An investigation of rheumatoid arthritis loci in patients with early-onset psoriasis validates association of the REL gene.
Phenotypically diverse autoimmune conditions share common genetic susceptibility loci and underlying molecular pathways. We therefore investigated 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms, previously confirmed as being associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), in a UK cohort of 623 patients with early-onset psoriasis (presenting before age 40y) comparing with 2662 control subjects. Our findings confirm the association of early-onset psoriasis with REL (rs13031237, p=0.0027). The minor allele of REL had opposing effects upon susceptibility to disease in psoriasis and RA patients. Similar exploration of additional autoimmune loci and fine-mapping of such regions may provide further insight into the genetics and molecular pathophysiology of psoriasis.

A comparison between observed and simulated x-ray profiles in clusters of galaxies
Clusters of galaxies provide us with crucial information for the understanding of the cosmology of our Universe. Observations are becoming increasingly precise and simulations improving their accuracy, challenging theories. 	We have analysed how the new Millennium Gas Simulation concurs with theory and observation.	We first introduce the basic principles of the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, including the FRW metric. We then  explain how structure formation leads to galaxy and cluster formation. Clusters are the most massive gravitationally stable objects in the Universe; we describe their typical properties and key observables and how the Intracluster medium (a very hot, low density, optically thin, plasma) X-ray emission informs us about the characteristics of these objects.	The use and necessity of cosmological simulations is also discussed. We give an overview of the dark matter Millennium Simulation and the Millennium Gas Simulations which also include baryonic matter to the equation.We briefly go through every step necessary to produce these simulations and show simulated X-ray surface brightness maps eventually produced. We study the catalogues associated to each cluster, then we test the ability of the simulation to reproduce the expected mass function and scaling relations of clusters of galaxies.	Our main results focus on the surface brightness profiles of clusters; we define this property as well as the fitting model known as $\beta$ model. A series of case studies leads us to discuss whether the key parameters are correlated with one another and what they can tell us about the clusters. We establish that working with a large number of clusters will soften the influence of the radial range we are using to fit the $\beta$ model. Finally we compare the simulated sample to three recent observational data sets, and show that they are in reasonable agreement.

[cause, patient, theme, participant]

The purpose of attributing cause: beliefs about the causes of myocardial infarction.
Patients' beliefs concerning the causes of their illnesses are core to a number of theoretical models of illness behaviour. The current study explored the themes that emerged from patients' accounts of the causes of their first myocardial infarctions (MIs). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 patients within a week of their MI, at a UK district hospital. Transcripts were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Three researchers noted themes that emerged from each interview, then common themes were selected and refined on the basis of an aggregation of interviews. Three dominant themes emerged: (1) single versus multiple causation, (2) causes as triggers versus underlying dispositions, and (3) the potentially conflicting motives of avoiding blame whilst at the same time, seeking control. Whilst many participants had complex ideas concerning what caused their MI, and could often name several causes, they tended to emphasise the importance of a single cause, which often related to their symptoms. Further, several participants interpreted "cause" in terms of an acute trigger of MI, rather than as a chronic causal factor. Participants were apparently attempting to answer the question about why they had an MI now, leading to talk about single causes that trigger MI. By contrast, much previous research has been concerned with patients' knowledge of "risk factors", considering the production of only a few causes to reflect ignorance. A key process in participants attributing cause appeared to be attempting to avoid blaming themselves or others for their MI, whilst simultaneously seeking to assert control over future recurrence. Analysis of the functions and purposes of causal attribution suggests that patients' focus on blame and control may be both emotionally and behaviourally adaptive, if not necessarily epidemiologically precise. These findings suggest that interventions to change causal attributions may be misguided, and may even be harmful.

Identification of fibrocytes from mesenchymal stem cells in keloid tissue: a potential source of abnormal fibroblasts in keloid scarring.
Abnormal fibroblasts have been implicated in keloid formation, a benign but fibroproliferative skin disorder. However, the exact source of these cells remains unknown. Fibrocytes are considered to be hybrid mesenchymal/hematopoietic cells, having been identified in various fibrotic disorders as the precursors of fibroblasts. Therefore, we hypothesized that a population of fibrocytes is present in keloid tissue as opposed to the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). We compared the proportion of MSCs in keloid versus bone marrow-derived cells and compared fibrocytes in keloid as opposed to normal scar tissue. We also investigated the propagation of fibrocytes in serum-supplemented versus serum-free media. Using multicolor fluorescence-activated cell analysis, we found distinct populations of MSCs (CD34(-)CD73(+)CD90(+)CD105(+)) that were different from CD45RO(+)25F9(+)MRP8/14(+) fibrocytes present in keloid tissue, while very few fibrocytes were observed in normal scar tissue. The proportion of keloid-derived cells in serum-free or serum-supplemented cultures expressing these fibrocyte markers was greater than from cultures derived from normal scar tissue (p < 0.05). We found that the proliferation of CD45(+)/Col1(+) keloid cells in vitro was greater in serum-free media compared to serum-supplemented media. This is the first study to have identified fibrocytes isolated from keloid tissue and normal scars, utilizing a specific set of markers for fibrocytes. This finding may aid our understanding of the origin of abnormal fibroblasts identified in keloid scarring. The identification of fibrocyte populations distinct from MSCs in keloid scar tissue could lead to novel targets for therapeutic intervention, treatment and prevention of recurrence.

INTRODUCTION: Vandetanib is a once-daily oral agent that selectively inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, and RET (REarranged during Transfection) signaling. METHODS: This Phase I study investigated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of vandetanib when administered with either gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) or vinorelbine plus cisplatin (VC) in patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. RESULTS: Seventeen patients received vandetanib 100 mg/d plus VC (n = 9) or GC (n = 8). Three dose-limiting toxicities were reported in each treatment group: vandetanib + VC (pulmonary artery thrombosis and asymptomatic QTc prolongation n = 2); vandetanib + GC (peripheral ischemia due to arterial occlusion, pulmonary embolism, and limb venous thrombosis). The protocol definition of a tolerable dose was not met, and no patients were recruited to receive vandetanib 300 mg plus VC or GC. There was no apparent pharmacokinetic interaction between vandetanib and vinorelbine or gemcitabine, but there was an approximate 30% increase in the exposure to cisplatin, which may be due to accumulation of total platinum and/or an interaction with vandetanib. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, in patients with previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer, vandetanib 100 mg/d in combination with either VC or GC was not tolerated.

Comparative genome-scale metabolic modeling of actinomycetes: The topology of essential core metabolism
Actinomycetes are highly important bacteria. On one hand, some of them cause severe human and plant diseases, on the other hand, many species are known for their ability to produce antibiotics. Here we report the results of a comparative analysis of genome-scale metabolic models of 37 species of actinomycetes. Based on in silico knockouts we generated topological and genomic maps for each organism. Combining the collection of genome-wide models, we constructed a global enzyme association network to identify both a conserved "core network" and an "essential core network" of the entire group. As has been reported for low-degree metabolites in several organisms, low-degree enzymes (in linear pathways) turn out to be generally more essential than high-degree enzymes (in metabolic hubs). ?? 2011 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

Hydrocolloid dressings for healing diabetic foot ulcers.
BACKGROUND: Foot ulcers in people with diabetes are a prevalent and serious global health issue. Wound dressings are regarded as important components of ulcer treatment, with clinicians and patients having many different types to choose from including hydrocolloid dressings. There is a range of different hydrocolloids available including fibrous-hydrocolloid and hydrocolloid (matrix) dressings. A clear and current overview of current evidence is required to facilitate decision-making regarding dressing use. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of hydrocolloid wound dressings with no dressing or alternative dressings on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. SEARCH METHODS: We searched The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 4 January 2012); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4); Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to December Week 3 2011); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, January 03, 2012); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 52); and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 30 December 2011). There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA: Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that have compared the effects on ulcer healing of hydrocolloid with alternative wound dressings or no dressing in the treatment of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. MAIN RESULTS: We included four studies (511 participants) in the review: these compared hydrocolloids with basic wound contact dressings, foam dressings and alginate dressings. Meta-analysis of two studies indicated no statistically significant difference in ulcer healing between fibrous-hydrocolloids and basic wound contact dressings: risk ratio 1.01 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.38). One of these studies found that a basic wound contact dressing was more cost-effective than a fibrous-hydrocolloid dressing. One study compared a hydrocolloid-matrix dressing with a foam dressing and found no statistically significant difference in the number of ulcers healed. There was no statistically significant difference in healing between an antimicrobial (silver) fibrous-hydrocolloid dressing and standard alginate dressing; or an antimicrobial dressing (iodine-impregnated) and a standard fibrous hydrocolloid dressing. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Currently there is no research evidence to suggest that any type of hydrocolloid wound dressing is more effective in healing diabetic foot ulcers than other types of dressing. Decision makers may wish to consider aspects such as dressing cost and the wound management properties offered by each dressing type e.g. exudate management.

[tpmt, risk, activity, patient, myelosuppression, intermediate, allele, variant, study, thiopurine]

Are patients with intermediate TPMT activity at increased risk of myelosuppression when taking thiopurine medications?
Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) metabolizes thiopurine medications, including azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine. Absent TPMT activity (i.e., in individuals homozygous for a variant TPMT allele) is associated with an increased risk of myelosuppression in patients taking thiopurine drugs. However, it is not clear if there is also an increased risk for patients with intermediate TPMT activity (i.e., in individuals heterozygous for a variant TPMT allele). Aims: To quantify the increased risk of myelosuppression for patients with intermediate TPMT activity. Materials & methods: A systematic review identified published studies, up to 29 September 2008, that explored the relationship between TMPT and hematological adverse drug reactions to thiopurines. Following a critical appraisal of the quality of published studies, a meta-analysis calculated the odds ratio of myelosuppression for patients with intermediate TPMT activity compared with wild-type. Results: A total of 67 studies were identified, the majority retrospective cohort in design. Patients with two TPMT variant alleles who are TPMT deficient have a substantial increase in their risk of myelotoxicity (86% of deficient patients developed myelosuppression). The increase in odds ratio of developing leukopenia for patients with intermediate TPMT activity or one TPMT variant allele compared with wild-type was 4.19 (95% CI: 3.20-5.48). Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggests that individuals with both intermediate and absent TPMT activity have an increased risk of developing thiopurine-induced myelosuppression, compared with individuals with normal activity. However, there is significant variability in the quality of the reported studies and large prospective studies to clarify the size of the effect of TPMT variant alleles on the risk of myelosuppression should be conducted. Accurate risk assessments will provide important data to inform clinical guidelines.

European Temporary Staffing: The Changing Regulatory Landscape
In Europe, a policy priority is to maintain a balance between flexibility and employment security (OECD, 2004). The concept of achieving an appropriate balance in the labour market between ensuring the flexibility of employment options and providing sufficient levels of social security has been termed flexicurity (OECD, 2004). Temporary agency work, in turn, is seen as a facilitator of flexibilisation and hence a key component of the drive towards a labour market that operates on this flexicurity principle (ILO, 2009). Restrictive regulation is seen as a prime obstacle to the expansion of the temporary staffing industry and historically there have been many areas of Europe that have been dominated by strict employment protection legislation (EC, 2009). This Working Brief outlines patterns of the regulation of temporary agency work across Europe from 1990 to 2008 using one of the OECD Employment Protection Legislation Index measures.

Late BCNU lung: a light and ultrastructural study on the delayed effect of BCNU on the lung parenchyma.
We describe eight patients who developed interstitial pulmonary fibrosis following BCNU (carmustine) therapy for cerebral tumours. The fibrosis presented 12-17 (mean 14) years after exposure to the drug. A distinctive pattern of pulmonary fibrosis with involvement of the apices and subpleural areas was seen in one patient dying of the disease. Light microscopy showed interstitial elastosis and intra-alveolar fibrosis which was often focal with an associated mild lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, intra-alveolar oedema, macrophages, and some neutrophils. Ultrastructural studies showed electron lucency of type I pneumocytes, with breaks in the cytoplasmic membranes leaving a bare basement membrane. Degenerative change was also seen in endothelial cell cytoplasm along with lipofuscin deposition. While BCNU pulmonary fibrosis has been described up to 2 years after treatment, this complication so late after therapy, though rare, has important implications for the follow-up of patients receiving this drug.

The effect of IL-12 treatment on vaccine-enhanced illness during infection with respiratory syncytial virus.
In humans and mice, sensitisation to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) antigens can result in severe inflammatory lung disease during subsequent infection with the virus. Although specific antiviral T cells are thought to be responsible for this augmentation of disease, the precise role of different functional subsets is unknown. BALB/c mice sensitised to the major surface glycoprotein (G) of RSV expressed by recombinant vaccinia virus develop Th2-driven lung eosinophilia after intranasal challenge with the virus. Mice treated with IL-12 at various times during vaccination and challenge, had reduced vaccine-induced lung eosinophilia but increased total pulmonary lymphoid cell infiltration. Intracellular cytokine analysis showed that interferon-gamma production during challenge was increased and IL-4 and IL-5 reduced by IL-12 treatment. Though IL-12 treatment reduced lung eosinophilia, illness (as assessed by weight loss) was not eliminated and sometimes increased. Reversing Th2-associated pathology with IL-12 does not necessarily benefit the host.

A description and evaluation of a challenging behaviour workshop.
BACKGROUND: Ensuring good quality staff and patient relationships are key goals of long-stay inpatient services. It is therefore essential that staff have a good understanding of patients' needs and how to work with the challenges that can present in these environments. AIMS: We evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a workshop to help psychiatric staff with challenging behaviours. DESIGN: We used a quasi experimental design with assessments carried out at baseline and post intervention. We provided the training to staff on one low secure psychiatric unit and recorded the uptake of outcome assessments and the workshop itself. We assessed staff-patient relationships, burnout and ward atmosphere and staff also completed satisfaction questionnaires. RESULTS: Sixty-six percent of staff (n = 25) who were eligible to participate in the project completed initial outcome measures, but only 42% (n = 16) attended the workshop and only 34% (n = 13) completed follow-up measures. The workshop had no predicted effects on any of the outcomes assessed, but staff satisfaction with the training was generally positive. CONCLUSIONS: Building up positive relationships with staff, addressing negative expectations and seeking support from all levels of management are essential in terms of reducing barriers to training in psychiatric settings.

[ctgf, tumor, fibroblast, cell, growth, cav-1, stromal, autophagy, mda-mb-231]

CTGF drives autophagy, glycolysis and senescence in cancer-associated fibroblasts via HIF1 activation, metabolically promoting tumor growth.
Previous studies have demonstrated that loss of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) in stromal cells drives the activation of the TGF-β signaling, with increased transcription of TGF-β target genes, such as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). In addition, loss of stromal Cav-1 results in the metabolic reprogramming of cancer-associated fibroblasts, with the induction of autophagy and glycolysis. However, it remains unknown if activation of the TGF-β / CTGF pathway regulates the metabolism of cancer-associated fibroblasts. Therefore, we investigated whether CTGF modulates metabolism in the tumor microenvironment. For this purpose, CTGF was overexpressed in normal human fibroblasts or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Overexpression of CTGF induces HIF-1α-dependent metabolic alterations, with the induction of autophagy/mitophagy, senescence, and glycolysis. Here, we show that CTGF exerts compartment-specific effects on tumorigenesis, depending on the cell-type. In a xenograft model, CTGF overexpressing fibroblasts promote the growth of co-injected MDA-MB-231 cells, without any increases in angiogenesis. Conversely, CTGF overexpression in MDA-MB-231 cells dramatically inhibits tumor growth in mice. Intriguingly, increased extracellular matrix deposition was seen in tumors with either fibroblast or MDA-MB-231 overexpression of CTGF. Thus, the effects of CTGF expression on tumor formation are independent of its extracellular matrix function, but rather depend on its ability to activate catabolic metabolism. As such, CTGF-mediated induction of autophagy in fibroblasts supports tumor growth via the generation of recycled nutrients, whereas CTGF-mediated autophagy in breast cancer cells suppresses tumor growth, via tumor cell self-digestion. Our studies shed new light on the compartment-specific role of CTGF in mammary tumorigenesis, and provide novel insights into the mechanism(s) generating a lethal tumor microenvironment in patients lacking stromal Cav-1. As loss of Cav-1 is a stromal marker of poor clinical outcome in women with primary breast cancer, dissecting the downstream signaling effects of Cav-1 are important for understanding disease pathogenesis, and identifying novel therapeutic targets.

R-matrix and dynamical model calculations of three-body resonance decay widths
<p>Calculations of the decay widths of three-body resonances are considered using both R-matrix and dynamical three-body theoretical models. The R-matrix approach, which treats the three-body decay as two, ordered two-body decays, has both simultaneous and sequential particle emission pathways, each with an associated decay width. The question of how these two widths should be combined to determine the total resonance width is considered using comparisons with the width deduced from fully dynamical three-body model calculations. We use the decay of the well-understood He-6(2(+), 1.8 MeV) resonance (into He-4+n+n) as a benchmark case.</p>

Assessment of the impact of the scanner-related factors on brain morphometry analysis with Brainvisa.
BACKGROUND: Brain morphometry is extensively used in cross-sectional studies. However, the difference in the estimated values of the morphometric measures between patients and healthy subjects may be small and hence overshadowed by the scanner-related variability, especially with multicentre and longitudinal studies. It is important therefore to investigate the variability and reliability of morphometric measurements between different scanners and different sessions of the same scanner. METHODS: We assessed the variability and reliability for the grey matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid and cerebral hemisphere volumes as well as the global sulcal index, sulcal surface and mean geodesic depth using Brainvisa. We used datasets obtained across multiple MR scanners at 1.5 T and 3 T from the same groups of 13 and 11 healthy volunteers, respectively. For each morphometric measure, we conducted ANOVA analysis and verified whether the estimated values were significantly different across different scanners or different sessions of the same scanner. The between-centre and between-visit reliabilities were estimated from their contribution to the total variance, using a random-effects ANOVA model. To estimate the main processes responsible for low reliability, the results of brain segmentation were compared to those obtained using FAST within FSL. RESULTS: In a considerable number of cases, the main effects of both centre and visit factors were found to be significant. Moreover, both between-centre and between-visit reliabilities ranged from poor to excellent for most morphometric measures. A comparison between segmentation using Brainvisa and FAST revealed that FAST improved the reliabilities for most cases, suggesting that morphometry could benefit from improving the bias correction. However, the results were still significantly different across different scanners or different visits. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that for morphometry analysis with the current version of Brainvisa using data from multicentre or longitudinal studies, the scanner-related variability must be taken into account and where possible should be corrected for. We also suggest providing some flexibility to Brainvisa for a step-by-step analysis of the robustness of this package in terms of reproducibility of the results by allowing the bias corrected images to be imported from other packages and bias correction step be skipped, for example.

Diffraction dissociation contributions to two-nucleon knockout reactions and the suppression of shell-model strength
<p>The contributions to the cross sections of intermediate energy two-nucleon knockout reactions from events in which one nucleon is removed by the stripping (inelastic breakup) mechanism and a second by the diffraction (elastic breakup) mechanism are discussed. The small additional contributions from two-nucleon diffraction events are also estimated. The approach used combines the eikonal reaction and shell model structure theory frameworks. For reactions involving the removal of two well-bound like nucleons, at incident energies of order 100 MeV per nucleon, the additional cross sections are shown to be of approximately the same size as those from events in which both nucleons are stripped in inelastic interactions. These more complete dynamical calculations now permit a quantitative comparison of the theoretical cross sections with recent partial cross-section measurements of the two-neutron (two-proton) removal reactions from neutron-deficient (neutron-rich) nuclei. As has been observed in both nuclear- and electron-induced single-nucleon knockout reaction analyses, the theoretical two-nucleon knockout cross sections overestimate the measured values, requiring a suppression of the two nucleon shell-model transition strengths. The deduced two-nucleon suppression factors, <I>R<sub>s</sub></I>(2<i>N</i>), are consistent with a value of 0.5 for each of the five reactions considered.</p>

Advanced design methodologies for two-dimensional circuits are not sufficient to manage the added complexity caused by the third dimension. Consequently, design methodologies that efficiently handle the added complexity and inherent heterogeneity of 3-D circuits are necessary. These 3-D design methodologies should support robust and reliable 3-D circuits while considering different forms of vertical integration, such as system-in-package and 3-D ICs with fine grain vertical interconnections. Global signaling issues, such as clock and power distribution networks, are further exacerbated in vertical integration due to the limited number of package pins, the distance of these pins from other planes within the 3-D system, and the impedance characteristics of the through silicon vias (TSVs). In addition to these dedicated networks, global signaling techniques that incorporate the diverse traits of complex 3-D systems are required. One possible approach, potentially significantly reducing the complexity of interconnect issues in 3-D circuits, is 3-D networks-on-chip (NoC). Design methodologies that exploit the diversity of 3-D structures to further enhance the performance of multiplane integrated systems are necessary. The longest interconnects within a 3-D circuit are those interconnects comprising several TSVs and traversing multiple physical planes. Consequently, minimizing the delay of the interplane nets is of great importance. By considering the nonuniform impedance characteristics of the interplane interconnects while placing the TSVs, the delay of these nets is decreased. In addition, the difference in electrical behavior between the horizontal and vertical interconnects suggests that asymmetric structures can be useful candidates for distributing the clock signal within a 3-D circuit. A 3-D test circuit fabricated with a 180 nm si- - licon-on-insulator (SOI) technology, manufactured by MIT Lincoln Laboratories, exploring several clock distribution topologies is described. Correct operation at 1 GHz has been demonstrated. Several 3-D NoC topologies incorporating dissimilar 3-D interconnect structures are reviewed as a promising solution for communication limited systems-on-chip (SoC). Appropriate performance models are described to evaluate these topologies. Several forms of vertical integration, such as system-in-package and different candidate technologies for 3-D circuits, such as SOI, are considered. The techniques described in this paper address fundamental interconnect structures in the 3-D design process. Several interesting research problems in the design of 3-D circuits are also discussed.

Increased vulnerability of human ventricle to re-entrant excitation in hERG-linked variant 1 short QT syndrome.
The short QT syndrome (SQTS) is a genetically heterogeneous condition characterized by abbreviated QT intervals and an increased susceptibility to arrhythmia and sudden death. This simulation study identifies arrhythmogenic mechanisms in the rapid-delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Kr))-linked SQT1 variant of the SQTS. Markov chain (MC) models were found to be superior to Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) models in reproducing experimental data regarding effects of the N588K mutation on KCNH2-encoded hERG. These ionic channel models were then incorporated into human ventricular action potential (AP) models and into 1D and 2D idealised and realistic transmural ventricular tissue simulations and into a 3D anatomical model. In single cell models, the N588K mutation abbreviated ventricular cell AP duration at 90% repolarization (APD(90)) and decreased the maximal transmural voltage heterogeneity (δV) during APs. This resulted in decreased transmural heterogeneity of APD(90) and of the effective refractory period (ERP): effects that are anticipated to be anti-arrhythmic rather than pro-arrhythmic. However, with consideration of transmural heterogeneity of I(Kr) density in the intact tissue model based on the ten Tusscher-Noble-Noble-Panfilov ventricular model, not only did the N588K mutation lead to QT-shortening and increases in T-wave amplitude, but δV was found to be augmented in some local regions of ventricle tissue, resulting in increased tissue vulnerability for uni-directional conduction block and predisposing to formation of re-entrant excitation waves. In 2D and 3D tissue models, the N588K mutation facilitated and maintained re-entrant excitation waves due to the reduced substrate size necessary for sustaining re-entry. Thus, in SQT1 the N588K-hERG mutation facilitates initiation and maintenance of ventricular re-entry, increasing the lifespan of re-entrant spiral waves and the stability of scroll waves in 3D tissue.

Use of weekly, low dose, high frequency ultrasound for hard to heal venous leg ulcers: the VenUS III randomised controlled trial.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical effectiveness of weekly delivery of low dose, high frequency therapeutic ultrasound in conjunction with standard care for hard to heal venous leg ulcers. DESIGN: Multicentre, pragmatic, two arm randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Community and district nurse led services, community leg ulcer clinics, and hospital outpatient leg ulcer clinics in 12 urban and rural settings (11 in the United Kingdom and one in the Republic of Ireland). PARTICIPANTS: 337 patients with at least one venous leg ulcer of >6 months' duration or >5 cm(2) area and an ankle brachial pressure index of ≥ 0.8. INTERVENTIONS: Weekly administration of low dose, high frequency ultrasound therapy (0.5 W/cm(2), 1 MHz, pulsed pattern of 1:4) for up to 12 weeks plus standard care compared with standard care alone. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was time to healing of the largest eligible leg ulcer. Secondary outcomes were proportion of patients healed by 12 months, percentage and absolute change in ulcer size, proportion of time participants were ulcer-free, health related quality of life, and adverse events. RESULTS: The two groups showed no significant difference in the time to healing of the reference leg ulcer (log rank test, P=0.61). After adjustment for baseline ulcer area, baseline ulcer duration, use of compression bandaging, and study centre, there was still no evidence of a difference in time to healing (hazard ratio 0.99 (95% confidence interval 0.70 to 1.40), P=0.97). The median time to healing of the reference leg ulcer was inestimable. There was no significant difference between groups in the proportion of participants with all ulcers healed by 12 months (72/168 in ultrasound group v 78/169 in standard care group, P=0.39 for Fisher's exact test) nor in the change in ulcer size at four weeks by treatment group (model estimate 0.05 (95% CI -0.09 to 0.19)). There was no difference in time to complete healing of all ulcers (log rank test, P=0.61), with median time to healing of 328 days (95% CI 235 to inestimable) with standard care and 365 days (224 days to inestimable) with ultrasound. There was no evidence of a difference in rates of recurrence of healed ulcers (17/31 with ultrasound v 14/31 with standard care, P=0.68 for Fisher's exact test). There was no difference between the two groups in health related quality of life, both for the physical component score (model estimate 0.69 (-1.79 to 3.08)) and the mental component score (model estimate -0.93 (-3.30 to 1.44)), but there were significantly more adverse events in the ultrasound group (model estimate 0.30 (0.01 to 0.60)). There was a significant relation between time to ulcer healing and baseline ulcer area (hazard ratio 0.64 (0.55 to 0.75)) and baseline ulcer duration (hazard ratio 0.59 (0.50 to 0.71)), with larger and older ulcers taking longer to heal. In addition, those centres with high recruitment rates had the highest healing rates. CONCLUSIONS: Low dose, high frequency ultrasound administered weekly for 12 weeks during dressing changes in addition to standard care did not increase ulcer healing rates, affect quality of life, or reduce ulcer recurrence.

Use of the short form health survey (SF-36) in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: tests of data quality, score reliability, response rate and scaling assumptions.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate response rate, data quality, score reliability and scaling assumptions of the 36 item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) in a large scale pan European survey of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. DESIGN: A questionnaire based survey of patients diagnosed with ALS across 15 European countries. SAMPLE PATIENTS: presenting at neurological clinics for treatment of their condition were asked to partake in the survey. RESULTS: 948 patients have been recruited into the survey, from whom responses have been gained in 754 (79.5%). Scores on the eight dimensions of the SF-36 were found to manifest high internal consistency reliability. Items were, in most instances, found to be most highly correlated with their own (corrected) scale score than with other scale scores. However, on two dimensions (role-physical and role-emotional) there was high levels of missing data, together with substantial floor and ceiling effects. The two factor model (of underlying constructs of physical and emotional health) for the SF-36 suggested by the developers was not supported in this patient group. CONCLUSION The SF-36 appears to provide reliable information for this patient group, and for the most part there are high levels of item completeness and good spread of scores. This is not, however, true for the role functioning dimensions. Furthermore, the underlying two factor model for the SF-36 was not supported. The implications for measuring health status in this patient group are discussed.

The plastids of cryptophytes, haptophytes, and heterokontophytes (stramenopiles) (together once known as chromists) are surrounded by four membranes, reflecting the origin of these plastids through secondary endosymbiosis. They share this trait with apicomplexans, which are alveolates, the plastids of which have been suggested to stem from the same secondary symbiotic event and therefore form a phylogenetic clade, the chromalveolates. The chromists are quantitatively the most important eukaryotic contributors to primary production in marine ecosystems. The mechanisms of protein import across their four plastid membranes are still poorly understood. Components of an endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery in cryptophytes, partially encoded by the reduced genome of the secondary symbiont (the nucleomorph), are implicated in protein transport across the second outermost plastid membrane. Here, we show that the haptophyte Emiliania huxleyi, like cryptophytes, stramenopiles, and apicomplexans, possesses a nuclear-encoded symbiont-specific ERAD machinery (SELMA, symbiont-specific ERAD-like machinery) in addition to the host ERAD system, with targeting signals that are able to direct green fluorescent protein or yellow fluorescent protein to the predicted cellular localization in transformed cells of the stramenopile Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Phylogenies of the duplicated ERAD factors reveal that all SELMA components trace back to a red algal origin. In contrast, the host copies of cryptophytes and haptophytes associate with the green lineage to the exclusion of stramenopiles and alveolates. Although all chromalveolates with four membrane-bound plastids possess the SELMA system, this has apparently not arisen in a single endosymbiotic event. Thus, our data do not support the chromalveolate hypothesis.

[humic, acid, sorption, eu3, concentration, ion, mineral, strength]

EXPERIMENTAL AND MATHEMATICAL MODELLING OF METAL ION-HUMIC ACID-SILICATE MINERALS INTERACTIONS
A series of experiments were performed to study the sorption of humic acid and Eu3+ ion (at trace concentrations) on the minerals: montmorillonite, bentonite, diatomite and kaolinite in ternary systems. Humic acid and europium sorption were investigated as a function of humic acid concentration, ionic strength and pH. There was a strong uptake of humic acid on to the minerals with sorption increasing as humic acid concentration decreases. For montmorillonite, the uptake of discrete size fractions was also studied. It was found that the larger fractions were more strongly sorbing and were better able to retain Eu in solution.The ionic strength has an impact on Eu behaviour: in the absence of humic acid, sorption strength decreases, whilst in the presence of high concentrations of humic it increases. The sorption of Eu3+ increases from pH 2 to 5 in both the presence and absence of humic acid. Above pH 5, the Eu3+ showed different behaviour with and without humic acid, and as humic concentration became high (100 ppm), the Eu behaves in the same way as the humic. Bentonite is able to sorb humic acid and Eu3+ at any concentration expected in the environment, and shows the strongest sorption of any of the materials tested. Experiments confirmed that Eu is an excellent analogue for Am in these systems.The sorption of selected divalent and trivalent metal ions: Ni2+, Co2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Eu3+ and Cr3+ on montmorillonite has been investigated in the micro-molar concentration range. In all cases, sorption strength increased with pH, and was consistently stronger for the tri-valent ions. In the presence of humic acid, there was some evidence for the enhancement of sorption. Uptake of metal ions (Co2+, Ni2+, Cd2+, Cr3+, Eu3+ and La3+) by natural and modified kaolinite was studied, and for all except Cr3+, it was found that kaolinite modified by manganese hydrothermal treatment gave the strongest sorption.A simple kinetic model was developed to simulate the experimental data for the sorption of humic acid and Eu3+ on the minerals. The model allows two humic binding sites on the mineral surface and two types of humic in solution, which can have different Eu3+ binding strengths. Metal ion surface complexation is modelled with a single kinetic equation. Ternary complexes are included in the model. The interaction of humic acid on the minerals can be fitted reasonably well. However, for the Eu3+ ion behaviour, although the model was able to give a reasonable fit to data for montmorillonite and bentonite, it could not reproduce the behaviour for kaolinite and diatomite.

Computational tools for the synthetic design of biochemical pathways
As the field of synthetic biology is developing, the prospects for de novo design of biosynthetic pathways are becoming more and more realistic. Hence, there is an increasing need for computational tools that can support these efforts. A range of algorithms has been developed that can be used to identify all possible metabolic pathways and their corresponding enzymatic parts. These can then be ranked according to various properties and modelled in an organism-specific context. Finally, design software can aid the biologist in the integration of a selected pathway into smartly regulated transcriptional units. Here, we review key existing tools and offer suggestions for how informatics can help to shape the future of synthetic microbiology. ?? 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

[cognitive, patient, episode, south, asian, memory, function, domain, psychosis, population]

First episode psychosis patients show impaired cognitive function - a study of a South Asian population in the UK.
Background: Cognitive deficits are a core symptom of schizophrenia, severely debilitating and untreated by current medication. However, to date there is limited research focusing on the precise nature of the cognitive disturbances at first episode in ethnic populations. Improved understanding of this will allow improved approaches to therapy. The aim of this study was to investigate cognitive function with a first episode of psychosis South Asian patients. Methods: Twenty South Asian first episode psychosis patients and 15 healthy South Asian matched controls were recruited. All were second generation South Asian people living in the UK. Subjects who took part in the study completed the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (patient group), the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading and a battery of neuropsychological assessments to assess specific domains of cognition of relevance to Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) (all groups). Results: Results show that first episode patients performed significantly worse than controls across all cognitive domains tested using CANTAB. Significant impairments were found in tests of visual and spatial memory, executive function, working memory, spatial planning and attention. Importantly, a number of cognitive performance indices (visual memory, spatial memory, executive function) were positively correlated with the severity of negative symptoms. Conclusion: We demonstrate that first episode South Asian patients display significant and specific cognitive deficits with evidence to support an association between negative symptoms and certain cognitive domains at first episode in this patient population.

Control of traveling-wave oscillations and bifurcation behavior in central pattern generators
Understanding synchronous and traveling-wave oscillations, particularly as they relate to transitions between different types of behavior, is a central problem in modeling biological systems. Here, we address this problem in the context of central pattern generators (CPGs). We use contraction theory to establish the global stability of a traveling-wave or synchronous oscillation, determined by the type of coupling. This opens the door to better design of coupling architectures to create the desired type of stable oscillations. We then use coupling that is both amplitude and phase dependent to create either globally stable synchronous or traveling-wave solutions. Using the CPG motor neuron network of a leech as an example, we show that while both traveling and synchronous oscillations can be achieved by several types of coupling, the transition between different types of behavior is dictated by a specific coupling architecture. In particular, it is only the “repulsive” but not the commonly used phase or rotational coupling that can explain the transition to high-frequency synchronous oscillations that have been observed in the heartbeat pattern generator of a leech. This shows that the overall dynamics of a CPG can be highly sensitive to the type of coupling used, even for coupling architectures that are widely believed to produce the same qualitative behavior.

[stroke, infection, ischaemic, mechanism, important]

Acute ischaemic stroke and infection: recent and emerging concepts.
The relation between acute ischaemic stroke and infection is complex. Infection appears to be an important trigger that precedes up to a third of ischaemic strokes and can bring about stroke through a range of potential mechanisms. Infections that present subsequent to stroke also complicate up to a third of cases of stroke and might worsen outcome. Inflammatory responses, which are a defence mechanism against infection but can also be a pathogenic mechanism that precipitates stroke and neurological sequelae, are important features. Although factors such as stroke severity and dysphagia are important predictors of poststroke infection, there is evidence from experimental and clinical settings of impaired immunity or brain-induced immunodepression after stroke. Greater understanding of the relation between inflammation and both infection and ischaemic mechanisms is needed. This might be particularly important because new treatment strategies for acute ischaemic stroke are being investigated, including those that modulate cytokines and the immune system.

MRI-informed functional EIT lung imaging
This paper gives illustrative results from a recent pilot study of functional dynamics of the lung with healthy male volunteers at the University of Manchester. 3D EIT reconstructions and MRI scans of basic lung function have been acquired in order to compare the two modalities. The outer surface of the MRI image of the torso, and electrode-positions obtained from MRI fiducial markers, aided the construction of a finite element model extruded along the long axis of the subject. Both EIT and MRI image data streams were co-registered using the open source medical imaging software, 3D Slicer. The resultant data fusion provides a highly effectivemethod of directly comparing EIT and MRI images. The EIT images show very good spatial resolution under dynamic conditions, revealing spatial and temporal differences in lung ventilation between the subject in the seated and supine positions.

Molecular imaging and biological evaluation of HuMV833 anti-VEGF antibody: implications for trial design of antiangiogenic antibodies.
BACKGROUND: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent angiogenic cytokine, and various inhibitory agents, including specific antibodies, have been developed to block VEGF-stimulated angiogenesis. We developed HuMV833, a humanized version of a mouse monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody (MV833) that has antitumor activity against a number of human tumor xenografts, and investigated the distribution and biologic effects of HuMV833 in patients in a phase I trial. METHODS: Twenty patients with progressive solid tumors were treated with various doses of HuMV833 (0.3, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg). Positron emission tomography with (124)I-HuMV833 was used to measure the antibody distribution in and clearance from tissues. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure the vascular permeability surface area product with a first-pass pharmacokinetic model (k(fp)) to determine tumor vascular permeability. RESULTS: The antibody was generally well tolerated, although the incremental dose, phase I study design, and pharmacodynamic endpoints could not identify the optimum biologically active dose. Antibody distribution and clearance were markedly heterogeneous between and within patients and between and within individual tumors. HuMV833 distribution to normal tissues also varied among patients, but the antibody was cleared from these tissues in a homogeneous fashion. Permeability was strongly heterogeneous between and within patients and between and within individual tumors. All tumors showed a reduction in k(fp) 48 hours after the first treatment (median = 44%; range = 4%-91%). CONCLUSIONS: Because of the heterogeneity in tumor biology with respect to antibody uptake and clearance, we suggest that either intrapatient dose escalation approaches or larger, more precisely defined patient cohorts would be preferable to conventional strategies in the design of phase I studies with antiangiogenic compounds like HuMV833.

[psoriasis, keratinocyte, laminin, membrane, expression, basement]

Concepts in psoriasis: psoriasis and the extracellular matrix.
Post-streptococcal guttate psoriasis only sometimes progresses to the persistent plaque psoriasis. We have previously proposed that psoriasis is driven by multiple extradomain A+ fibronectin (EDA+ FN) 'feedback loops'. The psoriasis-specific loop, the 'keratinocyte loop', depends upon expression by keratinocytes of α5β1 integrin. In normal skin, α5β1 expression is minimal or absent in resting epithelial cells, where basal cells are anchored to the laminin component of the basement membrane (via integrins α6β4 and α3β1). However, when the laminin layer is disrupted, due to wounding for instance, α5β1 is then strongly expressed by basal cells as a means for anchoring. At uninvolved skin sites in patients with psoriasis the laminin layer within the basement membrane is disrupted, with a consequential increase in the expression by basal keratinocytes of EDA+ FN and α5β1. We are postulating that in guttate psoriasis streptococcal lytic enzymes, and in particular streptokinase, may - via plasminogen activation - initiate a disruption of the laminin layer in the basement membrane. It is also possible that the expression by proliferating keratinocytes of plasminogen-activating factor might result in additional laminin digestion. The suggestion is that progression of guttate psoriasis to full-blown plaque psoriasis, or to its spontaneous resolution, is governed largely by the triggering of humoral immune responses. Thus, if streptococcal lytic enzymes are neutralized by host antibodies in advance of irreversible and lasting damage to the basement membrane of the dermal papillae, then guttate psoriasis will resolve spontaneously. In contrast, if permanent damage is induced prior to effective neutralization of the relevant bacterial toxins, then keratinocytes will become chronically destabilized. The consequence will be to liberate keratinocytes to proliferate in response to various stimuli, and to continue to elaborate plasminogen activation enzymes; the combined effect being, in concert with immunological priming, to precipitate and sustain plaque psoriasis.

[disease, lung, virus, tnf]

Inhibition of tumor necrosis factor reduces the severity of virus-specific lung immunopathology.
TNF antagonists are effective treatments for rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease, and have been tried with variable success in other diseases caused by immune damage. To test the hypothesis that viral lung diseases caused by respiratory syncytial virus or influenza virus are partly due to overproduction of TNF, we used anti-TNF antibody to treat mice with lung disease caused by these viruses. TNF depletion reduced pulmonary recruitment of inflammatory cells, cytokine production by T cells and the severity of illness without preventing virus clearance. These broad beneficial effects suggest that TNF antagonists might be tested as treatments of human viral lung diseases.

Ethnic nominalism and civic religiosity: Christianity and national identity in Britain
The relationship between religion and national identity is a contested topic in public debates about cultural diversity and immigration. In sample surveys only a minority the British population identify themselves as belonging to a Christian religion, and far fewer practise their faith. Nevertheless, nearly a quarter of the population think it is important to be Christian to be truly British. This study explores the complex relationships between religious and national identities in Britain, using data from the 2008 British Social Attitudes Survey. Three different forms of national identity were identified through factor analysis: civic-symbolic, cultural-aesthetic and ethnic national identity. Ethnic national identity is the only dimension of national identity that is positively associated with thinking it is important to be Christian to be British. While churchgoing Christians are more likely to feel national in response to secular cultural symbols, they are less likely to associate religion with nationality than those with a nominal Christian affiliation. The results indicate that Christianity has cultural significance for national identity primarily as a proxy for ethnic identity.

Ageing in urban environments: Developing `age-friendly' cities
Developing environments responsive to the aspirations and needs of older people has become a major concern for social and public policy. This article aims to provide a critical perspective on what has been termed `age-friendly cities' by shifting the focus from questions such as `What is an ideal city for older people?' to the question of `How age-friendly are cities?' This approach, it is argued, might be more suited to deal with the complexities of cities as sites of interlocking and conflicting commercial, social, and political interests. This theme is developed by examining: first, the main factors driving the age-friendly debate; second, constraints and opportunities for older people living in urban environments; third, options for a critical social policy; and, fourth, examples of involving older people in the development of age-friendly environments. The article concludes with a brief summary of current tensions and contradictions in the age-friendly debate.

Improving Design of Micro-business Systems via VSM and Constituent Orientation Analysis
<p>This paper describes recent design research into prototypical ‘classes’ of designs for operational business systems for micro-businesses of 1-10 employees typical of traditional craft and contemporary information economies. </p>
<p>
Business process design is an increasingly important and relatively new sub-field of design and design research. Its increasing importance is driven by three factors made more potent by information technology: increasing ability for very small business units to contribute to local and national economies; potential for increased efficiency of micro-businesses via reduction in Coasian transaction costs; increasingly competitive business environments leading to pressure on micro-businesses to deeply cut costs; and increased potential for improved design of micro-business processes to create significant benefits for the micro-businesses themselves and to local and national economies.</p>
<p>
The analyses used in this paper combine Tellefsen's perspective on constituent orientation with Beerian Viable System analysis and Cashflow Quadrant analysis (Beer, 1972, 1988, 1989, 1995; Kiyosaki & Lechter, 2007; Tellefsen, 1995, 1999, 2001; Tellefsen & Love, 2003). These analyses are used to identify promising foci of design effort particularly with the intention of automating and systematizing business activities.</p>
<p>
The paper first describes the importance of developing improved guidelines for design of organisational structures and business processes in the micro-business arena. It then outlines the structural, humanistic, financial, business management and computerized automation considerations that need to be addressed. Design issues are illustrated via mini case studies of three characteristic micro-businesses in the areas of publishing, plumbing, and rental investment. The paper shows how improvements to the design of business processes can be viewed through how four constituent orientations: <br />
•	Self employed <br />
•	Business managers <br />
•	Business owners <br />
•	Investors <br />
The paper concludes by integrating the outcomes of the above analyses into a preliminary checklist for the design of effective and efficient automated and systematized business processes for micro-businesses and small business enterprises.

Posaconazole: the case for therapeutic drug monitoring.
Invasive fungal infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Antifungal therapeutic options remain relatively limited; therefore, optimization of present regimens is essential. Posaconazole is licensed for prevention of invasive fungal infections and oropharyngeal candidiasis and salvage therapy for invasive aspergillosis. Recent data suggest that therapeutic drug monitoring may be an important tool for patient management. Clinical and laboratory animal data suggest that posaconazole demonstrates clinically relevant exposure-response relationships. Higher systemic drug exposure is associated with improved clinical outcomes. Potentially subtherapeutic concentrations are frequently encountered in critically ill patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring provides a way to optimize the use of posaconazole, and this review summarizes the indications and process by which this can be achieved.

Ketone bodies and two-compartment tumor metabolism: stromal ketone production fuels mitochondrial biogenesis in epithelial cancer cells.
We have previously suggested that ketone body metabolism is critical for tumor progression and metastasis. Here, using a co-culture system employing human breast cancer cells (MCF7) and hTERT-immortalized fibroblasts, we provide new evidence to directly support this hypothesis. More specifically, we show that the enzymes required for ketone body production are highly upregulated within cancer-associated fibroblasts. This appears to be mechanistically controlled by the stromal expression of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) and/or serum starvation. In addition, treatment with ketone bodies (such as 3-hydroxy-butyrate, and/or butanediol) is sufficient to drive mitochondrial biogenesis in human breast cancer cells. This observation was also validated by unbiased proteomic analysis. Interestingly, an MCT1 inhibitor was sufficient to block the onset of mitochondrial biogenesis in human breast cancer cells, suggesting a possible avenue for anticancer therapy. Finally, using human breast cancer tumor samples, we directly confirmed that the enzymes associated with ketone body production (HMGCS2, HMGCL and BDH1) were preferentially expressed in the tumor stroma. Conversely, enzymes associated with ketone re-utilization (ACAT1) and mitochondrial biogenesis (HSP60) were selectively associated with the epithelial tumor cell compartment. Our current findings are consistent with the "two-compartment tumor metabolism" model. Furthermore, they suggest that we should target ketone body metabolism as a new area for drug discovery, for the prevention and treatment of human cancers.

Extended spectrum of human glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit 3 deficiency: novel genotypes and phenotypic variability in severe congenital neutropenia.
OBJECTIVE: To delineate the phenotypic and molecular spectrum of patients with a syndromic variant of severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) due to mutations in the gene encoding glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit 3 (G6PC3). STUDY DESIGN: Patients with syndromic SCN were characterized for associated malformations and referred to us for G6PC3 mutational analysis. RESULTS: In a cohort of 31 patients with syndromic SCN, we identified 16 patients with G6PC3 deficiency including 11 patients with novel biallelic mutations. We show that nonhematologic features of G6PC3 deficiency are good predictive indicators for mutations in G6PC3. Additionally, we demonstrate genetic variability in this disease and define novel features such as growth hormone deficiency, genital malformations, disrupted bone remodeling, and abnormalities of the integument. G6PC3 mutations may be associated with hydronephrosis or facial dysmorphism. The risk of transition to myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia may be lower than in other genetically defined SCN subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: The phenotypic and molecular spectrum in G6PC3 deficiency is wider than previously appreciated. The risk of transition to myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia may be lower in G6PC3 deficiency compared with other subgroups of SCN.

[mass, metabolite, datum, plant, resonance]

Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance mass spectrometry for plant metabolite profiling and metabolite identification.
Mass spectrometry (MS) is usually the technique of choice for metabolomic studies where the volume of sample material is too limited for applications employing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. With the advent of ultra-high accuracy mass spectrometers such as the Orbitrap (resolution ∼ 10(5)) and the Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FT-ICR) analysers (resolution potentially in excess of 10(6)) there is the opportunity to generate an accurate mass fingerprint (often referred to as a profile since the variables are considered as effectively discrete) of an infused sample extract. In such data representations mass "peaks" are detected in the raw data and the centroid mass intensity calculated. The resolving power and sensitivity of these ultra-high accuracy mass analysers is such that metabolite signals from molecules containing naturally abundant elemental isotopes (e.g. (13)C, (41)K, (15)N, (17)O, (34)S, and (37)Cl) are visible in the data. Such is the instruments precision that it allows for the calculation of highly accurate elemental compositions for the unknown signals, thus aiding greatly in the selection of potential metabolite candidates for the annotation of unknowns prior to their confirmation by comparisons to analytical standards. The application of FT-ICR-MS to plant metabolomics has thus far been limited to a few studies and clear step-by-step methodologies are as yet unavailable. This chapter presents a rigorous method for the extraction and FT-ICR-MS analysis of plant leaf tissues as well as downstream data processing.

Anxiety and depression in psychosis: a systematic review of associations with positive psychotic symptoms.
OBJECTIVE: This review explores the influence of anxiety and depression on the experience of positive psychotic symptoms, and investigates the possibility of a causal role for anxiety and depression in the emergence and persistence of psychosis. METHOD: A systematic literature search was undertaken, producing a number of papers which comment on the links between anxiety and depression, and the experience of delusions and hallucinations. In addition, evidence which could contribute to our understanding of the causal role of anxiety and depression was highlighted. RESULTS: The findings show that both anxiety and depression are associated in meaningful ways with the severity of delusions and hallucinations, the distress they elicit and their content. However, the cross-sectional nature of the majority of studies and the focus on certain symptom subtypes tempers the validity of the findings. Data from non-clinical samples, studies which track the longitudinal course of psychosis and those which examine the impact of anxiety and depression on the prognosis for people experiencing psychosis, offer some support for the possibility of an influential role for anxiety and depression. CONCLUSION: We conclude that anxiety and depression are related to psychotic symptom severity, distress and content and are also linked with sub-clinical experiences, symptom development, prognosis and relapse. These links may imply that anxiety and depression could be targets for therapeutic intervention. The article concludes with suggestions for further research, highlighting avenues which may circumvent the limitations of the body of work as it stands.

[gliotransmission, signalling, astrocyte, brain, exocytotic, astrocytic, secretory]

Astroglial excitability and gliotransmission: an appraisal of Ca2+ as a signalling route.
Astroglial cells, due to their passive electrical properties, were long considered subservient to neurons and to merely provide the framework and metabolic support of the brain. Although astrocytes do play such structural and housekeeping roles in the brain, these glial cells also contribute to the brain's computational power and behavioural output. These more active functions are endowed by the Ca(2+)-based excitability displayed by astrocytes. An increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) levels in astrocytes can lead to the release of signalling molecules, a process termed gliotransmission, via the process of regulated exocytosis. Dynamic components of astrocytic exocytosis include the vesicular-plasma membrane secretory machinery, as well as the vesicular traffic, which is governed not only by general cytoskeletal elements but also by astrocyte-specific IFs (intermediate filaments). Gliotransmitters released into the ECS (extracellular space) can exert their actions on neighbouring neurons, to modulate synaptic transmission and plasticity, and to affect behaviour by modulating the sleep homoeostat. Besides these novel physiological roles, astrocytic Ca(2+) dynamics, Ca(2+)-dependent gliotransmission and astrocyte-neuron signalling have been also implicated in brain disorders, such as epilepsy. The aim of this review is to highlight the newer findings concerning Ca(2+) signalling in astrocytes and exocytotic gliotransmission. For this we report on Ca(2+) sources and sinks that are necessary and sufficient for regulating the exocytotic release of gliotransmitters and discuss secretory machinery, secretory vesicles and vesicle mobility regulation. Finally, we consider the exocytotic gliotransmission in the modulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity, as well as the astrocytic contribution to sleep behaviour and epilepsy.

Clinical practice with anti-dementia drugs: a revised (second) consensus statement from the British Association for Psychopharmacology.
The British Association for Psychopharmacology (BAP) coordinated a meeting of experts to review and revise its first (2006) Guidelines for clinical practice with anti-dementia drugs. As before, levels of evidence were rated using accepted standards which were then translated into grades of recommendation A to D, with A having the strongest evidence base (from randomized controlled trials) and D the weakest (case studies or expert opinion). Current clinical diagnostic criteria for dementia have sufficient accuracy to be applied in clinical practice (B) and brain imaging can improve diagnostic accuracy (B). Cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) are effective for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (A) and memantine for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease (A). Until further evidence is available other drugs, including statins, anti-inflammatory drugs, vitamin E and Ginkgo biloba, cannot be recommended either for the treatment or prevention of Alzheimer's disease (A). Neither cholinesterase inhibitors nor memantine are effective in those with mild cognitive impairment (A). Cholinesterase inhibitors are not effective in frontotemporal dementia and may cause agitation (A), though selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may help behavioural (but not cognitive) features (B). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be used for the treatment of people with Lewy body dementias (Parkinson's disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)), especially for neuropsychiatric symptoms (A). Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine can produce cognitive improvements in DLB (A). There is no clear evidence that any intervention can prevent or delay the onset of dementia. Although the consensus statement focuses on medication, psychological interventions can be effective in addition to pharmacotherapy, both for cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms. Many novel pharmacological approaches involving strategies to reduce amyloid and/or tau deposition are in progress. Although results of pivotal studies are awaited, results to date have been equivocal and no disease-modifying agents are either licensed or can be currently recommended for clinical use.

Purification and properties of a prokaryote type glutamine synthetase from the bialaphos producer Streptomyces hygroscopicus SF1293
A prokaryote type glutamine synthetase (GS) was purified from a bialaphos (BA)-producing organism, Streptomyces hygroscopicus SF1293 (SF1293). The GS (GS I) consisted of a 55,000 dalton subunit, and its N-terminal amino acid sequence was similar to that of S. coelicolor GS. GS I was highly sensitive to GS inhibitor phosphinothricin (PPT). An increase of GS activity was observed accompanied by BA accumulation.

Incremental Construction of Component-based Systems
Building large and complex systems in one step (the 'big bang' approach) is a very challenging task, given that humans can only deal with a limited measure of complexity at a time. A more practical approach would be to build such systems incrementally, i.e. iteratively increment an incomplete version of the system under construction until the system is completed. In software engineering, there are such approaches, but they are generally top-down, and not component-based. In this paper we present a component-based approach, which is bottom-up, and demonstrate its feasibility by applying it to the CoCoME example.

Ofatumumab monotherapy in rituximab-refractory follicular lymphoma: results from a multicenter study.
New treatments are required for rituximab-refractory follicular lymphoma (FL). In the present study, patients with rituximab-refractory FL received 8 weekly infusions of ofatumumab (CD20 mAb; dose 1, 300 mg and doses 2-8, 500 or 1000 mg; N = 116). The median age of these patients was 61 years, 47% had high-risk Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index scores, 65% were chemotherapy-refractory, and the median number of prior therapies was 4. The overall response rate was 13% and 10% for the 500-mg and 1000-mg arms, respectively. Among 27 patients refractory to rituximab monotherapy, the overall response rate was 22%. The median progression-free survival was 5.8 months. Forty-six percent of patients demonstrated tumor reduction 3 months after therapy initiation, and the median progression-free survival for these patients was 9.1 months. The most common adverse events included infections, rash, urticaria, fatigue, and pruritus. Three patients experienced grade 3 infusion-related reactions, none of which were considered serious events. Grade 3-4 neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in a subset of patients. Ofatumumab was well tolerated and modestly active in this heavily pretreated, rituximab-refractory population and is therefore now being studied in less refractory FL and in combination with other agents in various B-cell neoplasms. The present study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00394836.

DISCOVERY OF NINE GAMMA-RAY PULSARS IN FERMI LARGE AREA TELESCOPE DATA USING A NEW BLIND SEARCH METHOD
We report the discovery of nine previously unknown gamma-ray pulsars in a blind search of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). The pulsars were found with a novel hierarchical search method originally developed for detecting continuous gravitational waves from rapidly rotating neutron stars. Designed to find isolated pulsars spinning at up to kHz frequencies, the new method is computationally efficient and incorporates several advances, including a metric-based gridding of the search parameter space (frequency, frequency derivative, and sky location) and the use of photon probability weights. The nine pulsars have spin frequencies between 3 and 12 Hz, and characteristic ages ranging from 17 kyr to 3 Myr. Two of them, PSRs J1803-2149 and J2111+ 4606, are young and energetic Galactic-plane pulsars (spin-down power above 6 ?? 1035 erg s???1 and ages below 100 kyr). The seven remaining pulsars, PSRs J0106+4855, J0622+3749, J1620-4927, J1746-3239, J2028+3332, J2030+4415, and J2139+4716, are older and less energetic; two of them are located at higher Galactic latitudes (|b| \&gt; 10??). PSR J0106+4855 has the largest characteristic age (3 Myr) and the smallest surface magnetic field (2 ?? 1011 G) of all LAT blind-search pulsars. PSR J2139+4716 has the lowest spin-down power (3 ?? 1033 erg s???1) among all non-recycled gamma-ray pulsars ever found. Despite extensive multi-frequency observations, only PSR J0106+4855 has detectable pulsations in the radio band. The other eight pulsars belong to the increasing population of radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsars.

A single amino acid substitution in region 1.2 of the principal ?? factor of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) results in pleiotropic loss of antibiotic production
Antibiotic production in streptomycetes generally occurs in a growth phase-dependent and developmentally co-ordinated manner, and is subject to pathway-specific and pleiotropic control. Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) produces at least four chemically distinct antibiotics, including actinorhodin (Act) and undecylprodigiosin (Red). afsB mutants of S. coelicolor are deficient in the production of both compounds and in the synthesis of a diffusible ??-butyrolactone, SCB1, that can elicit precocious Act and Red production. Clones encoding the principal and essential ?? factor (??(HrdB)) of S. coelicolor restored Act and Red production in the afsB mutant BH5. A highly conserved glycine (G) at position 243 of ??(HrdB) was shown to be replaced by aspartate (D) in BH5. Replacement of G243 by D in the afsB+ strain M145 reproduced the afsB phenotype. The antibiotic deficiency correlated with reduced transcription of actII-ORF4 and redD, pathway-specific regulatory genes for Act and Red production respectively. Exogenous addition of SCB1 to the G-243D mutants failed to restore Act and Red synthesis, indicating that loss of antibiotic production was not a result of the deficiency in SCB1 synthesis. The G-243D substitution, which lies in the highly conserved 1.2 region of undefined function, had no effect on growth rate or morphological differentiation, and appears specifically to affect antibiotic production.

Impurity-induced configuration-transition in the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state of a d-wave superconductor
The effect of impurities on Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) states in a layered superconductor with d-wave pairing symmetry is investigated using the tight-binding model and the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. At low temperature and a strong exchange or Zeeman field applied parallel to its conducting plane, a two-dimensional (2D) square lattice-like Larkin-Ovchinnikov state is more energetically favorable in a clean system. In the presence of impurities, the spatial profile of the order parameter remains as a 2D square lattice, and it is distorted only near the impurities when the impurity concentration is low. As impurity concentration is increased to a certain level, a quasi-one-dimensional (1D)-like FFLO state becomes more energetically favorable. Increasing temperature with fixed impurity concentration can also induce a 2D to 1D FFLO state transition. Within the present finite-size calculation, we did not find the existence of the Fulde and Ferrell state before the system becomes normal as the impurity concentration is raised.

Recovering independent associations in genetics: a comparison.
In genetics, it is often of interest to discover single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are directly related to a disease, rather than just being associated with it. Few methods exist, however, for addressing this so-called "true sparsity recovery" issue. In a thorough simulation study, we show that for moderate or low correlation between predictors, lasso-based methods perform well at true sparsity recovery, despite not being specifically designed for this purpose. For large correlations, however, more specialized methods are needed. Stability selection and direct effect testing perform well in all situations, including when the correlation is large.

Consistency of orthodontic treatment planning decisions.
OBJECTIVE: (i) To analyse the consistency of a group of orthodontists' treatment decisions and (ii) to identify factors that may influence this consistency. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. SUBJECTS: Ten orthodontists. METHODS: The orthodontists examined 60 case vignettes and recorded their treatment decisions on two separate occasions. MAIN MEASURE: Inter- and intra-examiner agreement was evaluated with the Kappa statistic. RESULTS: The consistency within each orthodontist was moderate. However, between-orthodontist consistency was poor. CONCLUSION: It appears that there is marked variation between orthodontists in treatment planning decisions and this may reflect the lack of evidence for the effectiveness of competing treatments.

Dynamical Model of Coherent Circularly Polarized Optical Pulse Interactions with Two-Level Quantum Systems
<p>We propose and develop a method for theoretical description of circularly (elliptically) polarized optical pulse resonant coherent interactions with two-level atoms. The method is based on the time-evolution equations of a two-level quantum system in the presence of a time-dependent dipole perturbation for electric dipole transitions between states with total angular-momentum projection difference (Delta J(z)=+/- 1) excited by a circularly polarized electromagnetic field Feynman , J. Appl. Phys. 28, 49 (1957). The adopted real-vector representation approach allows for coupling with the vectorial Maxwell's equations for the optical wave propagation and thus the resulting Maxwell pseudospin equations can be numerically solved in the time domain without any approximations. The model permits a more exact study of the ultrafast coherent pulse propagation effects taking into account the vector nature of the electromagnetic field and hence the polarization state of the optical excitation. We demonstrate self-induced transparency effects and formation of polarized solitons. The model represents a qualitative extension of the well-known optical Maxwell-Bloch equations valid for linearly polarized light and a tool for studying coherent quantum control mechanisms.</p>

Measurement of the azimuthal ordering of charged hadrons with the ATLAS detector
This paper presents a study of the possible ordering of charged hadrons in the azimuthal angle relative to the beam axis in high-energy proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). A spectral analysis of correlations between longitudinal and transverse components of the momentum of the charged hadrons, driven by the search for phenomena related to the structure of the QCD field, is performed. Data were recorded with the ATLAS detector at center-of-mass energies of √s=900  GeV and √s=7  TeV. The correlations measured in a kinematic region dominated by low-psubscript T particles are not well described by conventional models of hadron production. The measured spectra show features consistent with the fragmentation of a QCD string represented by a helixlike ordered gluon chain.

Residual Stress and Phase Characterisation on Zirconium Oxides using Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction A
The present work was produced as part of the MUZIC consortium, a collaboration between a multi-university team from the UK and industrial partners working on the field of nuclear energy, fabrication of alloys and nuclear research. The aim of the project is to establish a multidiscipline mechanistic understanding of the corrosion and breakaway processes of zirconium alloys used as fuel cladding materials in the nuclear industry. A better understanding of the corrosion mechanism of zirconium alloys will not only aid the development of better performing alloys, but will also allow more accurate models to be developed to reliably predict the service life of existing alloys. This could lead to higher burn-up, increase of energy production and reduction of nuclear waste produced.This work seeks to provide a better understanding of the role of residual stresses in the oxide, which are produced during oxidation due to high Pilling-Bedworth ratio and their impact on oxide phase transformation and oxidation kinetics by employing high energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction techniques. This is achieved by observing how stresses change as oxide growth approaches and passes through transition of the corrosion kinetics, their evolution across the oxide thickness, in situ characterising stresses and phase growth early in oxidation process and how stress changes can affect corrosion properties.It was found that relatively high compressive stresses in the two oxide crystal structures are present. The stresses relax with time up to moments before transition where a possible threshold stress magnitude is reached to aid an extensive tetragonal to monoclinic phase transformation. This generalised tetragonal to monoclinic transformation is believed to produce highly stressed monoclinic crystal structure grains and cause defects in the oxide. The above observation is further supported by a decrease of the tetragonal zirconia content. This is the moment that the oxide looses its protective character and a transition of the corrosion kinetics occurs. By comparing different materials it was observed that the minimum magnitude of the tetragonal phase is lower in better performing alloys while the tetragonal content is some cases was relatively low. It is suggested that the amount of the tetragonal phase, in the oxide layer, is not as important as the rate of it transforming into monoclinic. The extent of tetragonal to monoclinic transformation, that introduces defects in the oxide, defines how protective an oxide layer is.The present work provides a contribution to the available knowledge of the importance of residual stresses in the oxide layer and metal substrate of zirconium alloys and how they can affect corrosion rates or act as a precursor to the corrosion transition.

Regulation of Cripto-1 signaling and biological activity by caveolin-1 in mammary epithelial cells.
Human and mouse Cripto-1 (CR-1/Cr-1) proteins play an important role in mammary gland development and tumorigenesis. In this study, we examined the relationship between Cripto-1 and caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a membrane protein that acts as a tumor suppressor in the mammary gland. Cripto-1 was found to interact with Cav-1 in COS7 cells and mammary epithelial cells. Using EpH4 mouse mammary epithelial cells expressing Cr-1 (EpH4 Cr-1) or Cr-1 and Cav-1 (EpH4 Cr-1/Cav-1), we demonstrate that Cav-1 expression markedly reduced the ability of Cr-1 to enhance migration, invasion, and formation of branching structures in EpH4 Cr-1/Cav-1 cells as compared to EpH4 Cr-1 cells. Furthermore, coexpression of Cav-1 together with Cr-1 in EpH4 Cr-1/Cav-1 cells inhibited Cr-1-mediated activation of c-src and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. Conversely, primary mammary epithelial cells isolated from Cav-1 null(-/-)/mouse mammary tumor virus-CR-1 transgenic animals showed enhanced motility and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-src as compared to Cav-1(+/-)/CR-1 mammary cells. Finally, mammary tumors derived from mouse mammary tumor virus-CR-1 mice showed a dramatic reduction of Cav-1 expression as compared to mammary tissue from normal FVB/N mice, suggesting that in vivo Cav-1 is down-regulated during the process of CR-1-mediated mammary tumorigenesis.

Genetic variation in vascular endothelial growth factor-a and lung function.
RATIONALE: Given the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in lung development, we hypothesized that polymorphisms in VEGF-A may be associated with lung function. OBJECTIVES: The current study was designed to assess the role of genetic variants in VEGF-A as determinants of airway function from infancy through early adulthood. METHODS: Association between five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VEGF-A and lung function were assessed longitudinally in two unselected birth cohorts and cross-sectionally among infants. Replication with two SNPs was conducted in adults and children with asthma. We investigated the functionality of the SNP most consistently associated with lung function (rs3025028) using Western blotting to measure the ratio of plasma VEGF-A(165b)/panVEGF-A(165) among homozygotes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In two populations in infancy, C-allele homozygotes of rs3025028 had significantly higher VmaxFRC, forced expiratory flow(50), and forced expiratory flow(25-75) compared with other genotype groups. Among preschool children (age 3 yr), C allele of rs3025028 was associated with significantly higher specific airway conductance, with similar findings observed for lung function in school-age children. For FEV(1)/FVC ratio similar findings were observed among adolescents and young adults (birth cohort), and then replicated in adults and schoolchildren with asthma (cross-sectional studies). For rs3025038, plasma VEGF-A(165b)/panVEGF-A(165) was significantly higher among CC versus GG homozygotes (P ≤ 0.02) at birth, in school-age children, and in adults. CONCLUSIONS: We report significant associations between VEGF-A SNP rs3025028 and parameters of airway function measured throughout childhood, with the effect persisting into adulthood. We propose that the mechanism may be mediated through the ratios of active and inhibitory isoforms of VEGF-A(165), which may be determined by alternative splicing.

Nanoantenna couplers for metal-insulator-metal waveguide interconnects
State-of-the-art copper interconnects suffer from increasing spatial power dissipation due to chip downscaling and RC delays reducing operation bandwidth. Wide bandwidth, minimized Ohmic loss, deep sub-wavelength confinement and high integration density are key features that make metal-insulator-metal waveguides (MIM) utilizing plasmonic modes attractive for applications in on-chip optical signal processing. Size-mismatch between two fundamental components (micron-size fibers and a few hundred nanometers wide waveguides) demands compact coupling methods for implementation of large scale on-chip optoelectronic device integration. Existing solutions use waveguide tapering, which requires more than 4λ-long taper distances. We demonstrate that nanoantennas can be integrated with MIM for enhancing coupling into MIM plasmonic modes. Two-dimensional finite-difference time domain simulations of antennawaveguide structures for TE and TM incident plane waves ranging from λ = 1300 to 1600 nm were done. The same MIM (100-nm-wide Ag/100-nm-wide SiO2/100-nm-wide Ag) was used for each case, while antenna dimensions were systematically varied. For nanoantennas disconnected from the MIM; field is strongly confined inside MIM-antenna gap region due to Fabry-Perot resonances. Major fraction of incident energy was not transferred into plasmonic modes. When the nanoantennas are connected to the MIM, stronger coupling is observed and E-field intensity at outer end of core is enhanced more than 70 times.

Do dentists refer orthodontic patients inappropriately?
One concern to both providers and consumers of orthodontic treatment is the length of new patient consultation waiting lists. A possible reason for the excessive length of these lists could be unnecessary referral of patients. This research project aimed to identify whether inappropriate referrals for new patient orthodontic consultations were a significant problem. The study was carried out in two FHSA areas in the north of England in two stages. The first part of the study involved an evaluation of GDP referral patterns to orthodontic secondary care providers. In the second part, information on the patients referred by the dentists was collected. We concluded that there was a marked variation in referral rates between the dentists and many patients were referred unnecessarily. Importantly, there was no association between dentists' referral rate and the number of inappropriate referrals made. It appears that referral guidelines for orthodontic treatment are necessary and they should be directed at all general dental practitioners.

Ambiguity and Variability of Database and Software Names in Bioinformatics
There are now numerous options available to achieve various tasks in bioinformatics but, as yet, little progress has been made to capture the common practice by analysing usage and mentions of databases and tools within the literature. In this paper we analyse the variability and ambiguity of database and software name mentions and provide a set of 30 full-text documents manually annotated on the mention level. Our analyses show that identification of mentions of databases and tools is not a task that can be achieved through dictionary matching alone: our baseline dictionary look-up achieved a F-score of just over 50%. This is primarily because of high variability and ambiguity in database and software mentions contained within the literature and due to the extensive number of resources available. We characterise the issues with various mention types and propose potential ways of capturing additional database and software mentions in the literature.

Sequence-dependent sliding kinetics of p53
Proper timing of gene expression requires that transcription factors (TFs) efficiently locate and bind their target sites within a genome. Theoretical studies have long proposed that one-dimensional sliding along DNA while simultaneously reading its sequence can accelerate TF’s location of target sites. Sliding by prokaryotic and eukaryotic TFs were subsequently observed. More recent theoretical investigations have argued that simultaneous reading and sliding is not possible for TFs without their possessing at least two DNA-binding modes. The tumor suppressor p53 has been shown to slide on DNA, and recent experiments have offered structural and single molecule support for a two-mode model for the protein. If the model is applicable to p53, then the requirement that TFs be able to read while sliding implies that noncognate sites will affect p53’s mobility on DNA, which will thus be generally sequence-dependent. Here, we confirm this prediction with single-molecule microscopy measurements of p53’s local diffusivity on noncognate DNA. We show how a two-mode model accurately predicts the variation in local diffusivity, while a single-mode model does not. We further determine that the best model of sequence-specific binding energy includes terms for “hemi-specific” binding, with one dimer of tetrameric p53 binding specifically to a half-site and the other binding nonspecifically to noncognate DNA. Our work provides evidence that the recognition by p53 of its targets and the timing thereof can depend on its noncognate binding properties and its ability to change between multiple modes of binding, in addition to the much better-studied effects of cognate-site binding.

Crossing Borders and Industry Sectors: Behavioral Governance in Strategic Alliances and Product Innovation for Competitive Advantage
This paper investigates governance mechanisms in international technology alliances (ITAs), firm-level innovation capabilities, and performance outcomes in the mobile computing market. This high-tech market is characterized by numerous cross-border strategic technology collaborations between software and hardware firms. Anchoring our work in interfirm governance theories and the resource-based view, we develop a model and empirically test relationships related to behavioral governance mechanisms, innovation capabilities, and business performance. In the cross-industry and cross-border context, the empirical model explains to what extent complementary strategic resources, through a relational governance mechanism, contribute to the innovation capabilities of high-tech firms, providing competitive advantage. The data, analyzed using partial least squares (PLS) path modeling, indicates that technological commitment is a factor in expediting technology resource exchange in ITAs between heterogeneous firms. Technological commitment is captured by the extent to which a focal firm commits to investing its technology resources in an ITA to maintain the relationship. The results also show that firm-level performance is only influenced by market development capability, and not new product development capability, in product innovation. However, we did not find any significant moderating effects of firm size and industry type on the model. This paper offers insights into how high-tech firms benefit from interfirm governance in international technology resource exchange arrangements. Furthermore, it provides evidence of the methodological usefulness of PLS path modeling in strategic alliance, capability and performance research.

Molecular simulation of chevrons in confined smectic liquid crystals
<p>Chevron structures adopted by confined smectic liquid crystals
are investigated via molecular dynamics simulations of the Gay-Berne
model. The chevrons are formed by quenching nematic films confined
between aligning planar substrates whose easy axes have opposing
azimuthal components. When the substrates are perfectly smooth, the
chevron formed migrates rapidly towards one of the confining walls to
yield a tilted layer structure. However, when substrate roughness is
included, by introducing a small-amplitude modulation to the particle-
substrate interaction well-depth, a symmetric chevron is formed which
remains stable over sufficiently long runtimes for detailed structural
information, such as the relevant order parameters and director orien-
tation, to be determined. For both smooth and rough boundaries, the
smectic order parameter remains non-zero across the entire chevron,
implying that layer identity is maintained across the chevron tip. Also, when the surface-stabilised chevron does eventually revert to a tilted layer structure, it does so via surface slippage, such that layer integrity is maintained throughout the chevron to tilted layer relaxation process.

However, the barriers to cycling remain significant to many. Combined with a light rail system the bicycle offers a compelling alternative to automobiles; yet, bicycles are denied access on certain rail systems because they can take too much space away from pedestrians who share the light rail interior. To help solve this problem, Co-Design in 3D virtual space is proposed as an effective means of creating an innovative design solution.</p>

AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION AND RESPIRATORY ILL-HEALTH IN A POPULATION AT INCREASED LUNG CANCER RISK
Background: Lung cancer is clinically silent and more than two-thirds of lung cancers present at a late stage and less than 10% of people survive for 5 years. Detection of lung cancer at an early stage may then potentially increase survival rates. As lung cancer risk is associated with airflow obstruction and increases with decreasing FEV1, in this study we are investigating the feasibility of detecting high risk individuals by identifying airflow obstruction and monitoring respiratory symptoms.Method: This is a population-based cohort study, with subjects aged 40–75 and registered with GP practices in the Wythenshawe District of Manchester recruited between November 2010 and December 2011. Data on risk factors for lung cancer were obtained from a face-to-face interview together with spirometry. Respiratory symptoms were assessed using a questionnaire based on the Medical Research Council Questionnaire (MRCQ). The association between the risk factors for lung cancer and recorded airflow obstruction was examined at baseline.Results: 2700 subjects were invited to participate. 273 (10.1%) subjects completed the baseline assessment and 260 (95.2%) completed spirometry. 175 participants (67.3%) reported no underlying respiratory disease. Ever smoking (p<0.05) but not exposure to passive smoke or occupational carcinogens and a family history of lung cancer was associated with airflow obstruction. Airflow obstruction was most severe (the lowest percentage of FEV1 predicted) in smokers compared with non-smokers. 85 + 21, n=189 vs. 98 + 18, n=71, p<0.05). Airflow obstruction was significantly associated with chronic cough, cough with phlegm, wheezing and shortness of breath in smokers (p<0.05). Compared to asymptomatic participants, subjects with respiratory symptoms were strongly associated with airflow obstruction; for chronic cough OR 3.69 (95% CI 1.94 –6.99); for cough with phlegm OR 4.09 (95% CI 2.10–8.00); for wheezing OR 3.68 (95% CI 1.95–6.98) and for shortness of breath OR 4.40 (95% CI 2.30–8.42).Conclusion: The community based study reaffirms that smokers with respiratory symptoms are at higher risk of having airflow obstruction, a powerful marker of lung cancer risk. Respiratory symptoms in smokers, with or without spirometry, may assist in targeting a high risk population for lung cancer screening.Disclosure: All authors have declared no conflicts of interest.

Effect of a Psychoeducational Intervention on Depression, Anxiety, and Health Resource Use in Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator Patients
mplantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). This study tested the effects of a psychoeducational interventionon anxiety, depressive symptoms, functional status, and health resource use during the first yearafter ICD implantation.Methods: ICD patients (n = 246) were randomized to usual care (UC), group (GRP), or telephonecounseling (TC) intervention that included education, symptom management, and coping skill training.Participants were 58 ± 11 years, 73% men, and 23% minorities. Anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety InventorySTAI), depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory II BDI-II), and functional status (Duke ActivityStatus Inventory DASI) were measured at baseline and after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Health resourceuse and disability days were tracked. Analyses were repeated-measures analysis of covariance to assessGroup × Time effects, χ2 for percentage with clinically significant anxiety and depression at each timepoint, and logistic regression.Results: All groups experienced decreased anxiety and depressive symptoms over the 12 months; GRPintervention had lower STAI (P = 0.03) than UC at 3months. Logistic regression revealed group differencesfor predicted probability of having depressive symptoms at 12 months (UC = 0.31, GRP = 0.17, TC = 0.13,P = 0.03). UC had greater calls to providers at 1 and 6 months (P < 0.05) and more sick/disability days at12 months (P = 0.01) than intervention groups.Conclusions: A psychoeducational intervention reduced anxiety and depressive symptoms early afterICD implant, lowered probability of depressive symptoms at 1 year, and decreased disability days/calls toproviders. These findings support further study and clinical use of both group and telephone interventionsto yield better psychological outcomes after ICD implant.

[nkg2d, cell, inhibitory, membrane, receptor, gm1-rich, nk, synapse, recruitment]

Inhibitory receptor signals suppress ligation-induced recruitment of NKG2D to GM1-rich membrane domains at the human NK cell immune synapse.
NKG2D is an activating receptor expressed on all human NK cells and a subset of T cells. In cytolytic conjugates between NK cells and target cells expressing its ligand MHC class I chain-related gene A, NKG2D accumulates at the immunological synapse with GM1-rich microdomains. Furthermore, NKG2D is specifically recruited to detergent-resistant membrane fractions upon ligation. However, in the presence of a strong inhibitory stimulus, NKG2D-mediated cytotoxicity can be intercepted, and recruitment of NKG2D to the immunological synapse and detergent-resistant membrane fractions is blocked. Also, downstream phosphorylation of Vav-1 triggered by NKG2D ligation is circumvented by coengaging inhibitory receptors. Thus, we propose that one way in which inhibitory signaling can control NKG2D-mediated activation is by blocking its recruitment to GM1-rich membrane domains. The accumulation of activating NK cell receptors in GM1-rich microdomains may provide the necessary platform from which stimulatory signals can proceed.

[dup, negative, symptom, datum, study]

Duration of untreated psychosis and negative symptoms — A systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data
AbstractBackgroundLonger duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) is associated with poorer outcome in terms of positive symptoms, relapse rate, and time to remission. In contrast, the association with negative symptoms is less consistent.AimsThe study had three aims. First, to arrive at a more precise estimate of the correlation between DUP and negative symptoms than previous reviews, by substantially increasing the amount of available data. Second, to see whether the strength of this correlation attenuated over longer follow-up intervals. Third, to determine whether there is a relationship between DUP and changes in negative symptoms.MethodRelevant databases were searched for studies published between December 1992 and March 2009 that reported data on DUP and negative symptoms. We obtained individual patient data where possible and calculated summary correlations between DUP and negative symptoms for each study at baseline, short and long-term follow-up. We used multilevel regression analysis to examine whether the effect of DUP on negative symptoms was the greatest in the early stages of illness.ResultsWe included 28 non-overlapping studies from the 402 papers detected by the search strategy. After contacting the authors we obtained individual patient data from 16 of these studies involving 3339 participants. The mean DUP was 61.4 weeks (SD = 132.7, median DUP = 12.0). Shorter DUP was significantly associated with less severe negative symptoms at baseline and also at short (1–2 years) and longer term follow-up (5–8 years) (r = 0.117, 0.180 and 0.202 respectively, p < 0.001). The relationship between improvement in negative symptoms and DUP was found to be non-linear: people with a DUP shorter than 9 months showed substantially greater negative symptom reduction than those with a DUP of greater than 9 months.ConclusionsShorter DUP is associated with less severe negative symptoms at short and long-term follow up, especially when the DUP is less than 9 months. Since there is no effective treatment for negative symptoms, reducing DUP to less than 9 months may be the best way to ameliorate them.KeywordsFirst episode psychosis; Schizophrenia; Treatment delay; Negative symptoms

Discovery of serum protein biomarkers for prostate cancer progression by proteomic analysis.
BACKGROUND: The incidence of prostate cancer (PCa) has increased in recent years due to the aging of the population and increased testing; however, mortality rates have remained largely unchanged. Studies have shown deficiencies in predicting patient outcome for both of the major PCa diagnostic tools, namely prostate specific antigen (PSA) and transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy. Therefore, serum biomarkers are needed that accurately predict prognosis of PCa (indolent vs. aggressive) and can thus inform clinical management. Aim: This study uses surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) mass spectrometry analysis to identify differential serum protein expression between PCa patients with indolent vs. aggressive disease categorised by Gleason grade and biochemical recurrence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 99 serum samples were selected for analysis. According to Gleason score, indolent (45 samples) and aggressive (54) forms of PCa were compared using univariate analysis. The same samples were then separated into groups of different recurrence status (10 metastatic, 15 biochemical recurrences and 70 non-recurrences) and subjected to univariate analysis in the same way. The data from Gleason score and recurrence groups were then analysed using multivariate statistical analysis to improve PCa biomarker classification. RESULTS: The comparison between serum protein spectra from indolent and aggressive samples resulted in the identification of twenty-six differentially expressed protein peaks (p<0.05), of which twenty proteins were found with 99% confidence. A total of 18 differentially expressed proteins (p<0.05) were found to distinguish between recurrence groups; three of these were robust with p<0.01. Sensitivity and specificity within the Gleason score group was 73.3% and 60% respectively and for the recurrence group 70% and 62.5%. CONCLUSION: SELDI-TOF-MS technology has facilitated the discovery of prognostic biomarkers in serum that can successfully discriminate aggressive from indolent PCa and also differentiate between recurrence groups.

[human, receptor, aea, cannabinoid, endocannabinoid, kc]

Endocannabinoids modulate human epidermal keratinocyte proliferation and survival via the sequential engagement of cannabinoid receptor-1 and transient receptor potential vanilloid-1.
We have recently shown that lipid mediators of the emerging endocannabinoid system (ECS) are key players of growth control of the human pilosebaceous unit. In this study, we asked whether the prototypic endocannabinoid anandamide (N-arachidonoylethanolamine, AEA) has a role in growth and survival of epidermal keratinocytes (KCs). Using human cultured KCs and skin organ-culture models, and by employing combined pharmacological and molecular approaches, we provide early evidence that AEA markedly suppresses KC proliferation and induces cell death, both in vitro and in situ. Moreover, we present that these cellular actions are mediated by a most probably constitutively active signaling mechanism that involves the activation of the metabotropic cannabinoid receptor CB(1) and a sequential engagement of the "ionotropic cannabinoid receptor" transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1). Finally, we demonstrate that the cellular effects of AEA are most probably due to a Ca(2+) influx via the non-selective, highly Ca(2+)-permeable ion channel TRPV1, and the concomitant elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration. The data reported here may encourage one to explore whether the targeted manipulation of the above signaling pathway of the cutaneous ECS could become a useful adjunct treatment strategy for hyperproliferative human dermatoses such as psoriasis or KC-derived skin tumors.

Regulation of ubiquitin-binding proteins by monoubiquitination
Proteins containing ubiquitin-binding domains (UBDs) interact with ubiquitinated targets and regulate diverse biological processes, including endocytosis, signal transduction, transcription and DNA repair. Many of the UBD-containing proteins are also themselves monoubiquitinated, but the functional role and the mechanisms that underlie this modification are less well understood. Here, we demonstrate that monoubiquitination of the endocytic proteins Sts1, Sts2, Eps15 and Hrs results in intramolecular interactions between ubiquitin and their UBDs, thereby preventing them from binding in trans to ubiquitinated targets. Permanent monoubiquitination of these proteins, mimicked by the fusion of ubiquitin to their carboxyl termini, impairs their ability to regulate trafficking of ubiquitinated receptors. Moreover, we mapped the in vivo monoubiquitination site in Sts2 and demonstrated that its mutation enhances the Sts2-mediated effects of epidermal-growth-factor-receptor downregulation. We propose that monoubiquitination of ubiquitin-binding proteins inhibits their capacity to bind to and control the functions of ubiquitinated targets in vivo. ?? 2006 Nature Publishing Group.

[cell, obatoclax, sclc, trial, patient, phase, ck18, death, bcl-2, study]

Optimization of circulating biomarkers of obatoclax-induced cell death in patients with small cell lung cancer.
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive disease in which, after initial sensitivity to platinum/etoposide chemotherapy, patients frequently relapse with drug-resistant disease. Deregulation of the Bcl-2 pathway is implicated in the pathogenesis of SCLC, and early phase studies of Bcl-2 inhibitors have been initiated in SCLC. Obatoclax is a small-molecule drug designed to target the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members to a proapoptotic effect. Preclinical studies were conducted to clarify the kinetics of obatoclax-induced apoptosis in a panel of SCLC cell lines to assist with the interpretation of biomarker data generated during early phase clinical trials. In vitro, obatoclax was synergistic with cisplatin and etoposide, and "priming" cells with obatoclax before the cytotoxics maximized tumor cell death. Peak levels of apoptosis, reflected by cleaved cytokeratin 18 (CK18) levels (M30 ELISA) and caspase activity (SR-DEVD-FMK), occurred 24 hours after obatoclax treatment. A phase 1b-2 trial of obatoclax administered using two infusion regimens in combination with carboplatin and etoposide has been completed in previously untreated patients with extensive-stage SCLC. Circulating pharmacodynamic biomarkers of cell death, full-length and/or cleaved CK18, and oligonucleosomal DNA were studied in the phase 1b trial. All SCLC patients classified as "responders" after two cycles of treatment showed significantly increased levels of full-length and cleaved CK18 (M65 ELISA) on day 3 of study. However, the preclinical data and the absence of a peak in circulating caspase-cleaved CK18 in trial patients suggest suboptimal timing of blood sampling, which will need refinement in future trials incorporating obatoclax.

THE FUTILITY OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IN LIGHT OF IMPERFECT MARKET PRICING
This thesis addresses the mechanics of executive remuneration from an unorthodox perspective; the view presented through the lens of imperfect market pricing. Whilst many of the criticisms of existing compensation arrangements are merited, they ignore the integrity of a crucial aspect of the way remuneration awards are calculated; the market pricing mechanism. The original contribution of knowledge of this thesis is to explain how imperfect market pricing undermines the utility of stock-based compensation awards, especially in light of the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-11 (‘GFC’).The existing position with regard to Anglo-American corporate governance emphasises the role of the market in determining optimal governance solutions. However, the market cannot regulate all conflicts. For example, the separation of ownership and control in modern corporations creates an agency problem whereby managerial and shareholder interests may diverge. Public companies therefore use performance-related pay to align the interests of management with those of firm owners. This performance-related pay often includes an element with a specific link to the price of company stock. A by-product of these arrangements is that incentives are created for executives to inflate the value of their companies in order to benefit from short-run price appreciation. This reduces the utility of stock-based pay and encourages market short-termism. There is however, a further fundamental flaw in the use of stock-based pay; it places complete faith in modern finance theory; a theory which asserts that market pricing is flawless (the so-called Efficient Capital Markets Hypothesis). However, financial and asset markets are susceptible to forces which drive prices away from intrinsic value for protracted periods and contribute to serious price distortion. Behavioural finance explains how these distortions occur and provides a more appropriate paradigm for securities market operation. The Financial Instability Hypothesis (‘FIH’) also explains how endogenous instability, emanating from the banking sector, arises as an inevitable consequence of the functioning of the capitalist economy. It further demonstrates how markets may be driven away from fundamental value, how asset bubbles occur, and how the market pricing mechanism is seriously distorted. The most serious recent crisis, the GFC, exhibited the FIH taxonomy. It exposed serious flaws in modern finance theory and revealed the dangers of flawed incentive systems in generating asset bubbles. Executives at financial institutions stand accused of short-termism, over-leveraging and poor risk management. Monitoring of management was impossible to perform effectively due to various behavioural and structural obstacles arising from the size and complexity of the institutions concerned. Moreover, a system of perverse incentives led to the failure of effective regulation of executive compensation.Reform is therefore required. The thesis will conclude with a critical analysis of recent amendments to the regulation of compensation systems at financial institutions. Based on this examination, the thesis will make some proposals for future remuneration packages in the wider economy. These proposals are designed to reduce the potential for financial instability through removing incentives for firm executives to concentrate on short-term results, and emphasize the role of qualitative indices of performance.

The new journeyman:  The role of an expert learner in eliciting and transmitting skilled knowledge
<p>This paper presents interim research findings of a project which seeks to elicit the skilled knowledge of master craftsmen through use of an expert learner (Horne) acting as intermediary between the craftsmen and a designer (Wood) creating a multimedia resource to support those wishing to learn the skill. It builds on previous research that evolved a set of principles for the design of multimedia learning materials (Wood & Rust 2003) and moved on to develop techniques for elicitation of expert knowledge from craft masters (Wood 2006). </p>
<p>
The skills involved in undertaking such craft practice involve a high degree of tacit knowledge which is internalised and frequently difficult for the craft expert to articulate. The expert learner has the ability to learn new skills with minimal instruction then articulate those skills before they become too internalised. The role of designer is to assist with this articulation and develop interpretation suitable for transmitting the knowledge to novice learners.</p>
<p>
This research focuses on the skills of traditional custom knife makers in Sheffield; Horne has worked alongside two traditional craftsmen, video recorded by Wood. Together they have collaborated to analyse the recordings and develop learning materials to disseminate the craft skill. These are currently being developed and tested using a small group of learners with some one-to-one teaching followed by self-directed development work using an on-line resource. </p>
<p>
The main finding for this stage of the research was that, as Horne had relatively recently acquired this knowledge, it had not become too internalised and she was able to rapidly adapt her understanding of it to improve transmission to the learners in a manner that had not been demonstrated by more experienced craft practitioners. The interactions between Horne and the learners were mediated by Wood, facilitating reciprocal reflection between the them and designing ‘bridges’ to help transmit the knowledge to future generations of learners.

Support surfaces for treating pressure injury: A Cochrane systematic review
OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects on healing of pressure relieving support surfaces in the treatment of pressure injury. DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Cochrane Wound Group Specialised Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL. The reference sections of included trials were searched for further trials. REVIEW METHODS: Randomised controlled trials, published or unpublished, assessing the effect of support surfaces in treating all pressure injuries were sought. All included studies had to have reported objective measures of pressure injury healing. Where possible, findings from individual trials were calculated using risk ratio estimates or mean difference with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Eighteen eligible trials involving 1309 participants were identified. There was no statistically significant effect on pressure injury size with low air loss devices compared with foam alternatives. One small trial at high risk of bias found that sheepskin positioned under the legs significantly reduced redness and a very small subgroup analysis favoured a profiling bed when compared with a standard bed in terms of the healing of grade 1 pressure injuries. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there was an absence of good evidence to support the superiority of any pressure relieving device in the treatment of pressure injuries. This review highlights that the current evidence base requires improving by undertaking robust trials to ascertain which support surfaces are most effective for the treatment of pressure injuries.

Safinamide and flecainide protect axons and reduce microglial activation in models of multiple sclerosis.
Axonal degeneration is a major cause of permanent disability in the inflammatory demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis, but no therapies are known to be effective in axonal protection. Sodium channel blocking agents can provide effective protection of axons in the white matter in experimental models of multiple sclerosis, but the mechanism of action (directly on axons or indirectly via immune modulation) remains uncertain. Here we have examined the efficacy of two sodium channel blocking agents to protect white matter axons in two forms of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a common model of multiple sclerosis. Safinamide is currently in phase III development for use in Parkinson's disease based on its inhibition of monoamine oxidase B, but the drug is also a potent state-dependent inhibitor of sodium channels. Safinamide provided significant protection against neurological deficit and axonal degeneration in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, even when administration was delayed until after the onset of neurological deficit. Protection of axons was associated with a significant reduction in the activation of microglia/macrophages within the central nervous system. To clarify which property of safinamide was likely to be involved in the suppression of the innate immune cells, the action of safinamide on microglia/macrophages was compared with that of the classical sodium channel blocking agent, flecainide, which has no recognized monoamine oxidase B activity, and which has previously been shown to protect the white matter in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Flecainide was also potent in suppressing microglial activation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. To distinguish whether the suppression of microglia was an indirect consequence of the reduction in axonal damage, or possibly instrumental in the axonal protection, the action of safinamide was examined in separate experiments in vitro. In cultured primary rat microglial cells activated by lipopolysaccharide, safinamide potently suppressed microglial superoxide production and enhanced the production of the anti-oxidant glutathione. The findings show that safinamide is effective in protecting axons from degeneration in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and that this effect is likely to involve a direct effect on microglia that can result in a less activated phenotype. Together, this work highlights the potential of safinamide as an effective neuroprotective agent in multiple sclerosis, and implicates microglia in the protective mechanism.

Donepezil and memantine for moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease.
BACKGROUND: Clinical trials have shown the benefits of cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. It is not known whether treatment benefits continue after the progression to moderate-to-severe disease. METHODS: We assigned 295 community-dwelling patients who had been treated with donepezil for at least 3 months and who had moderate or severe Alzheimer's disease (a score of 5 to 13 on the Standardized Mini-Mental State Examination SMMSE, on which scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function) to continue donepezil, discontinue donepezil, discontinue donepezil and start memantine, or continue donepezil and start memantine. Patients received the study treatment for 52 weeks. The coprimary outcomes were scores on the SMMSE and on the Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale (BADLS, on which scores range from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating greater impairment). The minimum clinically important differences were 1.4 points on the SMMSE and 3.5 points on the BADLS. RESULTS: Patients assigned to continue donepezil, as compared with those assigned to discontinue donepezil, had a score on the SMMSE that was higher by an average of 1.9 points (95% confidence interval CI, 1.3 to 2.5) and a score on the BADLS that was lower (indicating less impairment) by 3.0 points (95% CI, 1.8 to 4.3) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Patients assigned to receive memantine, as compared with those assigned to receive memantine placebo, had a score on the SMMSE that was an average of 1.2 points higher (95% CI, 0.6 to 1.8; P<0.001) and a score on the BADLS that was 1.5 points lower (95% CI, 0.3 to 2.8; P=0.02). The efficacy of donepezil and of memantine did not differ significantly in the presence or absence of the other. There were no significant benefits of the combination of donepezil and memantine over donepezil alone. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderate or severe Alzheimer's disease, continued treatment with donepezil was associated with cognitive benefits that exceeded the minimum clinically important difference and with significant functional benefits over the course of 12 months.

Monomeric red fluorescent proteins with a large Stokes shift
Two-photon microscopy has advanced fluorescence imaging ofcellular processes in living animals. Fluorescent proteins in theblue-green wavelength range are widely used in two-photonmicroscopy; however, the use of red fluorescent proteins is limitedby the low power output of Ti-Sapphire lasers above 1,000 nm. Toovercome this limitation we have developed two red fluorescentproteins, LSS-mKate1 and LSS-mKate2, which possess large Stokesshifts with excitation/emission maxima at 463∕624 and 460∕605nm, respectively. These LSS-mKates are characterized by high pHstability, photostability, rapid chromophore maturation, and monomericbehavior. They lack absorbance in the green region, providingan additional red color to the commonly used red fluorescentproteins. Substantial overlap between the two-photon excitationspectra of the LSS-mKates and blue-green fluorophores enablesmulticolor imaging using a single laser. We applied this approachto a mouse xenograft model of breast cancer to intravitally studythe motility and Golgi-nucleus alignment of tumor cells as a functionof their distance from blood vessels. Our data indicate thatwithin 40 μm the breast cancer cells show significant polarizationtowards vessels in living mice.

BACKGROUND: Zamifenacin is a new potent gut M3 selective muscarinic antagonist developed for possible use in irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: In this multicentre, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study, the effect of a single dose of zamifenacin 10 mg or 40 mg on both fasting (30 min) and fed (60 min) colonic motor activity was assessed in 36 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (aged 25-68 years; 19 male). Colonic motility was recorded using a five-channel solid-state catheter introduced by colonoscopy to a depth of 35 cm in an unprepared colon. RESULTS: Zamifenacin 40 mg profoundly reduced colonic motility, particularly after the meal (P < 0.05). This was reflected by a significant reduction in the mean amplitude of contractions, number of contractions, percentage duration of contractions, activity index and the motility index (P < 0.05). A smaller reduction in all the motility parameters was obtained with 10 mg zamifenacin, but these changes were not statistically significant. Three patients each on placebo and zamifenacin reported side-effects, but these were mild and transient. CONCLUSION: A single 40 mg dose of zamifenacin significantly reduces colonic motility in irritable bowel syndrome patients without significant antimuscarinic effects. The results of this study confirm that the concept of developing selective antimuscarinic agents may be a promising approach to the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. Not only would such compounds benefit from not having the usual side-effects of anticholinergics but they might also offer much more in the way of dose flexibility.

Decreased susceptibility of Candida albicans to azole antifungals: a complication of long-term treatment in autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) patients.
BACKGROUND: Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED, APS1) is an autosomal recessive disease exceptionally common in Finland. Most patients have chronic oral candidiasis from early childhood and this infection has been shown to be carcinogenic. Hence, patients receive repeated treatment and prophylactic courses of antifungals throughout life. In Finland, 92 patients have been diagnosed with APECED and 66 of them are currently alive. Our aim was to study the effect of long-term azole treatment on the candidal colonization of APECED patients and the influence on antifungal susceptibilities. METHODS: We evaluated the culture reports from 1994 to 2004 of 56 APECED patients followed in Helsinki University Central Hospital. Candida albicans strains of all 11 patients initially reported resistant (n = 27) and 12 patients reported susceptible (n = 16) to fluconazole were re-analysed for their susceptibility to fluconazole. Antifungal usage was analysed up to 30 years back. RESULTS: A total of 162 fungal cultures had been performed. Of these, 75% had been reported positive for Candida and 63% for C. albicans. Eleven patients (31.4%) had been reported to harbour at least once a C. albicans strain resistant to fluconazole. Re-analysis of the stored C. albicans strains originally reported to be resistant to fluconazole revealed a mean MIC of 19.5 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple courses (>6) of fluconazole annually and low dose prophylaxis are major risk factors for persistent colonization with C. albicans with decreased susceptibility in APECED patients.

[acro-osteolysis, severe, digital, patient, calcinosis, ischaemia]

Acro-osteolysis in systemic sclerosis is associated with digital ischaemia and severe calcinosis.
Objectives. Acro-osteolysis (bony resorption of the terminal digital tufts) is a well-recognized, but under-researched, manifestation of SSc. Our aim was to investigate the hypothesis that acro-osteolysis is associated with (i) the severity of digital ischaemia and (ii) the presence of calcinosis.Methods. This was a retrospective study of 101 patients with SSc in whom hand radiographs taken between 2001 and May 2008 were available for review. These radiographs were graded for severity of acro-osteolysis on a 0-4-point scale for each finger (0 = normal bone structure, 4 = severe pencilling of the terminal phalanges). From these scores, patients were subdivided into the following two groups: normal/minimal acro-osteolysis and moderate/severe acro-osteolysis. The presence or absence of calcinosis (mild, moderate or severe) was also documented.Results. Of the 101 patients, 68 were grouped as normal/minimal acro-osteolysis and 33 as moderate/severe acro-osteolysis. Forty-five had severe digital ischaemia: 25 (76%) of the patients with moderate/severe acro-osteolysis compared with 20 (29%) of those with normal/minimal acro-osteolysis (multifactorial analysis: P < 0.001). Patients with moderate/severe acro-osteolysis were more likely to have severe calcinosis (33% vs 13%), but this was not statistically significant after adjustment for potential confounders.Conclusion. Acro-osteolysis was strongly associated with severe digital ischaemia. The potential association with severe calcinosis merits further study. Prospective studies are required to investigate acro-osteolysis as a marker of digital vascular disease progression and of treatment response.

The association between social deprivation and the prevalence and severity of dental caries and fluorosis in populations with and without water fluoridation
BACKGROUND: To determine the association between social deprivation and the prevalence of caries (including caries lesions restricted to enamel) and enamel fluorosis in areas that are served by either fluoridated or non-fluoridated drinking water using clinical scoring, remote blinded, photographic scoring for caries and fluorosis. The study also aimed to explore the use of remote, blinded methodologies to minimize the effect of examiner bias. METHODS: Subjects were male and female lifetime residents aged 11-13 years. Clinical assessments of caries and fluorosis were performed on permanent teeth using ICDAS and blind scoring of standardized photographs of maxillary central incisors using TF Index (with cases for fluorosis defined as TF > 0). RESULTS: Data from 1783 subjects were available (910 Newcastle, 873 Manchester). Levels of material deprivation (Index of Multiple Deprivation) were comparable for both populations (Newcastle mean 35.22, range 2.77-78.85; Manchester mean 37.04, range 1.84-84.02). Subjects in the fluoridated population had significantly less caries experience than the non-fluoridated population when assessed by clinical scores or photographic scores across all quintiles of deprivation for white spot lesions: Newcastle mean DMFT 2.94 (clinical); 2.51 (photo), Manchester mean DMFT 4.48 (clinical); 3.44 (photo) and caries into dentine (Newcastle Mean DMFT 0.65 (clinical); 0.58 (photo), Manchester mean DMFT 1.07 (clinical); 0.98 (photo). The only exception being for the least deprived quintile for caries into dentine where there were no significant differences between the cities: Newcastle mean DMFT 0.38 (clinical); 0.36 (photo), Manchester mean DMFT 0.45 (clinical); 0.39 (photo). The odds ratio for white spot caries experience (or worse) in Manchester was 1.9 relative to Newcastle. The odds ratio for caries into dentine in Manchester was 1.8 relative to Newcastle. The odds ratio for developing fluorosis in Newcastle was 3.3 relative to Manchester. CONCLUSIONS: Water fluoridation appears to reduce the social class gradient between deprivation and caries experience when considering caries into dentine. However, this was associated with an increased risk of developing mild fluorosis. The use of intra-oral cameras and remote scoring of photographs for caries demonstrated good potential for blinded scoring.

[circuit, model, nucleus, basal, kitai, aspect, external, behaviour, neuron, firing]

A pulsed neural network model of bursting in the basal ganglia.
We present new techniques for extending the functionality of spiking neurons which allow the incorporation of several aspects of neuron function previously confined to the domain of low level ion-channel based models. These aspects include spontaneous (or endogenous) firing, the complex interaction of multiple ion-species and the spatial distribution of synaptic contacts over the cell membrane. These ideas are applied to a neural circuit consisting of the cortex and a subset of the nuclei in the basal ganglia-the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe). This circuit has been studied extensively in vitro by Plenz and Kitai Plenz, D., & Kitai, S. T. (1999). A basal ganglia pacemaker formed by the subthalamic nucleus and external globus pallidus. Nature, 400 677-682 whose data we use to constrain our model. With respect to this circuit, we have obtained three main results. First, that its characteristic burst firing is due to a Ca2+ current mediated mechanism. Second, that noise can assist in the generation of bursting and, paradoxically, stabilise the network behaviour under synaptic weight variations. Third, that a variety of dendritic processing is necessary in order to obtain the full range of bursting behaviour.

Detection of BRAF mutations in the tumour and serum of patients enrolled in the AZD6244 (ARRY-142886) advanced melanoma phase II study.
BACKGROUND: This study investigated the potential clinical utility of circulating free DNA (cfDNA) as a source of BRAF mutation detection in patients enrolled into a phase II study of AZD6244, a specific MEK1/2 inhibitor, in patients with advanced melanoma. METHODS: BRAF mutations were detected using Amplification Refractory Mutation System allele-specific PCR. BRAF mutation status was assessed in serum-derived cfDNA from 126 patients enrolled into the study and from 94 matched tumour samples. RESULTS: Of 94 tumour samples, 45 (47.9%) were found to be BRAF mutation positive (BRAF+). Serum-derived cfDNA was BRAF+ in 33 of 126 (26.2%) samples, including in five samples for which tumour data were unavailable. Of BRAF+ tumours, 25 of 45 (55.6%) were BRAF+ in cfDNA. In three cases in which the tumour was negative, cfDNA was BRAF+. Progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with BRAF+ tumour and cfDNA was not significantly different compared with tumour BRAF+ but cfDNA BRAF-negative patients, indicating that cfDNA BRAF detection is not associated with poorer prognosis on PFS in stage III/IV advanced melanoma. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the feasibility of BRAF mutation detection in cfDNA of patients with advanced melanoma. Future studies should aim to incorporate BRAF mutation testing in cfDNA to further validate this biomarker for patient selection.

[dose, device]

Effect of ion bombardment and annealing on the electrical properties of hydrogenated amorphous silicon metal-semiconductor-metal structures
<p>The electrical properties of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) devices are investigated as a function of Si bombardment dose prior to and after annealing. We observe that conduction in unbombarded devices is surface-barrier controlled whereas it is bulk controlled in bombarded devices. The resistance decreases with bombardment dose in a manner consistent with increased hopping conductivity in highly damaged structures. A relative permittivity of between 8 and 12, depending on dose, was calculated from experimental Poole-Frenkel plots for bombarded devices. These values compare closely with the theoretical relative permittivity for amorphous silicon of 11.7 and confirm that conduction is by Poole-Frenkel mechanism. For bulk-controlled conduction, we observe an increase in the zero-field Coulombic trap barrier height with decreasing dose, ranging from 0.53 for a Si dose of 5x10(13) cm(-2) to 0.89 for a dose of 2x10(12) cm(-2). We attribute this to a decrease in the concentration of charged defects with decreasing dose and find that the change in concentration of charged centers needs to be about 4x10(19) cm(-3) to account for the change of 0.35 eV from the lower to the upper dose. Activation energies obtained from Arrhenius plots of current density against temperature varied with dose and temperature in a similar way as Coulombic barrier height. We explain these results in terms of the variation in the number of charged defect centers with dose and annealing temperature and a shift in the Fermi level.</p>

[oxidative, fibroblast, tumor, mitochondrial, production, metabolism, stress, cancer, onset, metabolic]

Mitochondrial fission induces glycolytic reprogramming in cancer-associated myofibroblasts, driving stromal lactate production, and early tumor growth.
Recent studies have suggested that cancer cells behave as metabolic parasites, by inducing oxidative stress in adjacent normal fibroblasts. More specifically, oncogenic mutations in cancer cells lead to ROS production and the "secretion" of hydrogen peroxide species. Oxidative stress in stromal fibroblasts then induces their metabolic conversion into cancer-associated fibroblasts. Such oxidative stress drives the onset of autophagy, mitophagy, and aerobic glycolysis in fibroblasts, resulting in the local production of high-energy mitochondrial fuels (such as L-lactate, ketone bodies, and glutamine). These recycled nutrients are then transferred to cancer cells, where they are efficiently burned via oxidative mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS). We have termed this new energy-transfer mechanism "Two-Compartment Tumor Metabolism", to reflect that the production and consumption of nutrients (L-lactate and other catabolites) is highly compartmentalized. Thus, high-energy onco-catabolites are produced by the tumor stroma. Here, we used a genetic approach to stringently test this energy-transfer hypothesis. First, we generated hTERT-immortalized fibroblasts which were genetically re-programmed towards catabolic metabolism. Metabolic re-programming towards glycolytic metabolism was achieved by the recombinant over-expression of MFF (mitochondrial fission factor). MFF over-expression results in extensive mitochondrial fragmentation, driving mitochondrial dysfunction. Our results directly show that MFFfibroblasts undergo oxidative stress, with increased ROS production, and the onset of autophagy and mitophagy, both catabolic processes. Mechanistically, oxidative stress induces autophagy via NF-kB activation, also providing a link with inflammation. As a consequence MFF-fibroblasts showed intracellular ATP depletion and the extracellular secretion of L-lactate, a critical onco-catabolite. MFF-fibroblasts also showed signs of myofibroblast differentiation, with the expression of SMA and calponin. Importantly, MFF-fibroblasts signficantly promoted early tumor growth (up to 6.5-fold), despite a 20% overall reduction in angiogenesis. Thus, catabolic metabolism in cancer-associated fibroblasts may be a critical event during tumor intiation, allowing accelerated tumor growth, especially prior to the onset of neoangiogenesis.

[binding, transcription, foxm1, factor, cell, chromatin, forkhead, gene, cycle]

The Forkhead Transcription Factor FOXM1 Controls Cell Cycle-Dependent Gene Expression through an Atypical Chromatin Binding Mechanism.
There are nearly 50 forkhead (FOX) transcription factors encoded in the human genome and, due to sharing a common DNA binding domain, they are all thought to bind to similar DNA sequences. It is therefore unclear how these transcription factors are targeted to specific chromatin regions to elicit specific biological effects. Here, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) to investigate the genome-wide chromatin binding mechanisms used by the forkhead transcription factor FOXM1. In keeping with its previous association with cell cycle control, we demonstrate that FOXM1 binds and regulates a group of genes which are mainly involved in controlling late cell cycle events in the G(2) and M phases. However, rather than being recruited through canonical RYAAAYA forkhead binding motifs, FOXM1 binding is directed via CHR (cell cycle genes homology region) elements. FOXM1 binds these elements through protein-protein interactions with the MMB transcriptional activator complex. Thus, we have uncovered a novel and unexpected mode of chromatin binding of a FOX transcription factor that allows it to specifically control cell cycle-dependent gene expression.

Characterisation of long wavelength Photovoltaic devices based on GaAs/InAs Quantum Dots
Photovoltaic (PV) devices based on semiconductor materials have been demonstrated to be a good option for electricity generation. Many research efforts have been devoted to semiconductors solar PV in order to improve their efficiencies. One of the ways is to extend the absorption range of the device to the mid infra red. This can be achieved with the insertion of quantum dots (QDs) into a host lattice, which introduce new energy states. The doping of such structures has also proved to enhance the open-circuit voltage which in turn increase the device efficiency. The key challenge though is the growth of QDs based materials with expanded absorption spectrum and high open circuit voltage (Voc). We present the electrical and optical properties of several GaAs/InAs quantum dots (QDs) structures grown on GaAs substrate using Molecular Beam Epitaxy and having different doping profiles (0, 8x1010 and 16x1010 /cm2 in between the dots). In addition to the 1.4 eV (GaAs bandgap) energy state, two more energy states (1.37 and 1.2 eV) were generated by the incorporation of the InAs quantum dots. Very simple structures consisting of circular diodes and without any antireflection coating or attempts at reducing shadow effects from the contacts were tested. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the fabricated devices was measured for both undoped and n-doped structures. The doped samples exhibited lower EQE compared to the undoped one, which has a maximum EQE of 40%. The I-V characteristics under light were obtained using a 100mW/cm2 power light. The Voc of the n-doped material was extended up to the value of 0.8 volts but at the expense of the short-circuit current (Isc), which was reduced to 15.6 from ~ 20mA/cm2. The obtained Voc and Isc values are suitable for solar cell efficiency improvement. The QD device efficiencies were calculated. The doped 8x1010 /cm2 samples showed the highest efficiency of ~10 %, an excellent value for these simple structures.

GeneRank: Using search engine technology for the analysis of microarray experiments
Background: Interpretation of simple microarray experiments is usually based on the fold-change of gene expression between a reference and a "treated" sample where the treatment can be of many types from drug exposure to genetic variation. Interpretation of the results usually combines lists of differentially expressed genes with previous knowledge about their biological function. Here we evaluate a method - based on the PageRank algorithm employed by the popular search engine Google - that tries to automate some of this procedure to generate prioritized gene lists by exploiting biological background information. Results: GeneRank is an intuitive modification of PageRank that maintains many of its mathematical properties. It combines gene expression information with a network structure derived from gene annotations (gene ontologies) or expression profile correlations. Using both simulated and real data we find that the algorithm offers an improved ranking of genes compared to pure expression change rankings. Conclusion: Our modification of the PageRank algorithm provides an alternative method of evaluating microarray experimental results which combines prior knowledge about the underlying network. GeneRank offers an improvement compared to assessing the importance of a gene based on its experimentally observed fold-change alone and may be used as a basis for further analytical developments.

Randomized controlled trial of oral antifungal treatment for severe asthma with fungal sensitization: The Fungal Asthma Sensitization Trial (FAST) study.
RATIONALE: Some patients with severe asthma are immunologically sensitized to one or more fungi, a clinical entity categorized as severe asthma with fungal sensitization (SAFS). It is not known whether SAFS responds to antifungal therapy. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the response of SAFS to oral itraconazole. METHODS: Patients with severe asthma sensitized to at least one of seven fungi by skin prick or specific IgE testing were recruited. All had total IgE less than 1,000 IU/ml and negative Aspergillus precipitins. They were treated with oral itraconazole (200 mg twice daily) or placebo for 32 weeks, with follow-up for 16 weeks. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary end point was change in the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) score, with rhinitis score, total IgE, and respiratory function as secondary end points. Fifty-eight patients were enrolled, of whom 41% had been hospitalized in the previous year. Baseline mean AQLQ score was 4.13 (range, 1-7). At 32 weeks, the improvement (95% confidence interval) in AQLQ score was +0.85 (0.28, 1.41) in the antifungal group, compared with a -0.01 (-0.43, 0.42) change in the placebo group (P = 0.014). Rhinitis score improved (-0.43) in the antifungal, and deteriorated (+0.17) in the placebo group (P = 0.013). Morning peak flow improved (20.8 L/minute, P = 0.028) in the antifungal group. Total serum IgE decreased in the antifungal group (-51 IU/ml) but increased in placebo group (+30 IU/ml) (P = 0.001). No severe adverse events were observed, but seven patients developed adverse events requiring discontinuation, five in the antifungal group. CONCLUSIONS: SAFS responds to oral antifungal therapy as judged by large improvements in quality of life in about 60% of patients.

Altered integrin mechanotransduction in human nucleus pulposus cells derived from degenerated discs.
OBJECTIVE: Several studies have demonstrated biologic responses of intervertebral disc (IVD) cells to loading, although the mechanotransduction pathways have not been elucidated. In articular chondrocytes, which have a phenotype similar to that of IVD cells, a number of mechanoreceptors have been identified, with alpha5beta1 integrin acting as a predominant mechanoreceptor. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of integrin signaling in IVD cells during mechanical stimulation and to determine whether RGD integrins are involved. METHODS: Human nucleus pulposus (NP) cells derived from nondegenerated and degenerated discs were subjected to dynamic compressive loading in the presence of an RGD inhibitory peptide. Expression of the alpha5beta1 heterodimer in IVD tissue was examined by immunohistochemistry and possible alternative mechanoreceptors by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Aggrecan gene expression was decreased following loading of NP cells from nondegenerated and degenerated discs. This response was inhibited by treatment with an RGD peptide in cells from nondegenerated, but not degenerated, IVDs. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that expression of the alpha5beta1 heterodimer was unaltered in degenerated IVD tissue as compared with normal IVD tissue. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the mechanotransduction pathways are altered in cells from degenerated IVDs. Mechanosensing in NP cells from nondegenerated discs occurs via RGD integrins, possibly via the alpha5beta1 integrin, while cells from degenerated discs show a different signaling pathway that does not appear to involve RGD integrins.

Distal revascularisation/replantation using the reversed radial artery.
We describe a technique using the reversed radial artery for distal revascularisation or replantation in the hand. This technique has been used for revascularisation following crush avulsion injuries associated with a large zone of trauma and polydigit replantation. The technique involves dividing the radial artery and venae comitantes proximally and mobilising it distally into the hand for anastomosis. Temporary 'syndactylisation' of adjacent digits is also described. This can be used to convert multiple digits into a single vascular unit and to provide a bed for the transposed radial vessels. These techniques are an option when there is extensive injury to distal vessels such that end-to-end anastomosis is not possible and interposition venous micrografting may be difficult or prone to failure due to poor quality recipient vessels and the need to place grafts in a traumatised bed.

Carbon isotopic (13C and 14C) composition of synthetic estrogens and progestogens
Steroids are potent hormones that are found in many environments. Yet, contributions from
synthetic and endogenous sources are largely uncharacterized. The goal of this study was to
evaluate whether carbon isotopes could be used to distinguish between synthetic and endogenous
steroids in wastewater and other environmental matrices. Estrogens and progestogens were isolated from oral contraceptive pills using semi-preparative
liquid chromatography/diode array detection (LC/DAD). Compound purity was confirmed by
gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID), gas chromatography/time-of-flight
mass spectrometry (GC/TOF-MS) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry using negative
electrospray ionization (LC/ESI-MS). 13C content was determined by gas
chromatography/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/IRMS) and 14C was measured by
accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). Synthetic estrogens and progestogens are 13C depleted (δ13Cestrogen = -30.0 ± 0.9 ‰; δ13Cprogestogen
= -30.3 ± 2.6 ‰) compared to endogenous hormones (δ13C ~ -16 ‰ to -26 ‰). The 14C content
of the majority of synthetic hormones is consistent with synthesis from C3 plant-based
precursors, amended with “fossil” carbon in the case of EE2 and norethindrone acetate.
Exceptions are progestogens that contain an ethyl group at carbon position 13 and have entirely
“fossil” 14C signatures. Carbon isotope measurements have the potential to distinguish between synthetic and
endogenous hormones in the environment. Our results suggest that 13C could be used to
discriminate endogenous from synthetic estrogens in animal waste, wastewater effluent, and
natural waters. In contrast, 13C and 14C together may prove useful for tracking synthetic
progestogens.Author Posting. © The Author(s), 2012.  This is the author's version of the work. It is posted here by permission of John Wiley & Sons for personal use, not for redistribution.

For the CNT/BDD/felt samples, the electron field emission was observed at macroscopic fields as low as 1.1 V mu m(-1).

Molecular subdivision of the marine diatom Thalassiosira rotula in relation to geographic distribution, genome size, and physiology
Marine phytoplankton drift passively with currents, have high dispersal potentials and can be comprised of morphologically cryptic species. To examine molecular subdivision in the marine diatom Thalassiosira rotula, variations in rDNA sequence, genome size, and growth rate were examined among isolates collected from the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean basins. Analyses of rDNA included T. gravida because morphological studies have argued that T. rotula and T. gravida are conspecific.  Culture collection isolates of T. gravida and T. rotula diverged by 7.0 ± 0.3% at the ITS1 and by 0.8 ± 0.03% at the 28S. Within T. rotula, field and culture collection isolates were subdivided into three lineages that diverged by 0.6 ± 0.3% at the ITS1 and 0% at the 28S. The predicted ITS1 secondary structure revealed no compensatory base pair changes among lineages. Differences in genome size were observed among isolates, but were not correlated with ITS1 lineages. Maximum acclimated growth rates of isolates revealed genotype by environment effects, but these were also not correlated with ITS1 lineages. In contrast, intra-individual variation in the multi-copy ITS1 revealed no evidence of recombination amongst lineages, and molecular clock estimates indicated that lineages diverged 0.68 Mya. The three lineages exhibited different geographic distributions and, with one exception, each field sample was dominated by a single lineage.  The degree of inter- and intra-specific divergence between T. gravida and T. rotula suggests they should continue to be treated as separate species. The phylogenetic distinction of the three closely-related T. rotula lineages was unclear. On the one hand, the lineages showed no physiological differences, no consistent genome size differences and no significant changes in the ITS1 secondary structure, suggesting there are no barriers to interbreeding among lineages. In contrast, analysis of intra-individual variation in the multicopy ITS1 as well as molecular clock estimates of divergence suggest these lineages have not interbred for significant periods of time. Given the current data, these lineages should be considered a single species.

Q-Manifolds and Mackenzie Theory
Double Lie algebroids were discovered by Kirill Mackenzie from the studyof double Lie groupoids and were defined in terms of rather complicated conditionsmaking use of duality theory for Lie algebroids and double vector bundles. In this paperwe establish a simple alternative characterization of double Lie algebroids in a supermanifoldlanguage. Namely, we show that a double Lie algebroid in Mackenzie’s senseis equivalent to a double vector bundle endowed with a pair of commuting homological vector fields of appropriate weights. Our approach helps to simplify and elucidate Mackenzie’s original definition; we show how it fits into a bigger picture of equivalentstructures on ‘neighbor’ double vector bundles. It also opens ways for extending thetheory to multiple Lie algebroids, which we introduce here.

[digestion, blg, reactivity, allergenic, pc]

Effect of simulated gastro-duodenal digestion on the allergenic reactivity of beta-lactoglobulin.
UNLABELLED: ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Cow's milk (CM) allergy affects about 2% of infants. The allergenicity of dietary proteins, including those from CM, has been related to their digestibility although the generality of the link and its causality remains to be demonstrated. In this study we use an in vitro digestion system, to investigate the digestibility of β-lactoglobulin (blg) during gastrointestinal transit and to assess the impact of this process on blg allergenic reactivity in CM allergic children. METHODS: Blg digesta were prepared using an in vitro digestion protocol simulating either gastric digestion alone or followed by duodenal digestion with or without phosphatidylcholine (PC). Biochemical analysis of blg digesta was performed by SDS-PAGE and their concentration was measured by a sandwich ELISA. Assessment of their allergenic reactivity was done in vitro by EAST inhibition, specific basophil activation (basotest) and lymphocyte proliferation (PCNA-flow cytometry) assays using sera and cells from patients allergic to blg and in vivo by skin prick testing (SPT) of these patients. RESULTS: Blg was only broken down to smaller peptides after gastro-duodenal digestion although a sizeable amount of intact protein still remained. Digestion did not modify the IgE binding capacity of blg except for gastro-duodenal digestion performed in the absence of PC. These results are consistent with the quantity of intact blg remaining in the digesta. Overall both gastric and gastroduodenal digestion enhanced activation of sensitized basophils and proliferation of sensitized lymphocytes by blg. However, there was a tendency towards reduction in mean diameter of SPT following digestion, the PC alone during phase 1 digestion causing a significant increase in mean diameter. CONCLUSIONS: Digestion did not reduce the allergenic reactivity of blg to a clinically insignificant extent, PC inhibiting digestion and thereby protecting blg allergenic reactivity. SPT reactivity was reduced compared to blg immunoreactivity in in vitro tests.

Multiple dose pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole and their effects on antipyrine kinetics in man.
Ketoconazole 200 mg was given twice daily for five days to eight subjects. The serum pharmacokinetics were examined with the first dose on day 1 and with the ninth dose on day 5. The serum half life of ketoconazole was 74.8 +/- 13.9 min (mean +/- S.D.) on day 1, and 155.9 +/- 32.7 min on day 5. On day 1 the area under the serum concentration time curve was 626.9 +/- 230.1 mg/l.min, and 1441 +/- 897.3 mg/l.min on day 5. Antipyrine kinetics were determined before and after the course of ketoconazole. There was no significant change in the clearance and half life of antipyrine. Ketoconazole in the doses used in this study does not appear to alter hepatic microsomal enzyme activity in man. The increased ketoconazole half life and area under the serum concentration time curve on day 5 were in part caused by food. Other mechanisms for these changes such as saturation of a tissue compartment or a change in the elimination of ketoconazole during chronic dosing, may also be responsible.

[influenza, lung, mouse, infiltrate, infection, inflammatory]

An absence of reactive oxygen species improves the resolution of lung influenza infection.
Three influenza virus pandemics occurred in the last century, in 1918 killing 40-50 million people. In the absence of strain-specific vaccines, with potential resistance to antivirals and the threat of an imminent pandemic, strategies that alleviate symptoms are a priority. Reactive oxygen species are potent antimicrobial agents but cause immunopathology when produced in excess. Mice lacking a functional phagocyte NADPH oxidase (Cybb tm1 mice) or treated with the metalloporphyrin antioxidant manganese (III) tetrakis (N-ethyl pyridinium-2-yl) porpyhrin (MnTE-2-PyP) show heightened inflammatory infiltrates in their airways in response to pulmonary influenza infection, with augmented macrophage populations and a Th1-skewed T cell infiltrate. Underlying this exuberant macrophage response was a significant reduction in apoptosis and down-regulation of the myeloid inhibitory molecule CD200. Both, Cybb tm1 and MnTE-2-PyP-treated mice exhibited a reduced influenza titer in the lung parenchyma. Inflammatory infiltrate into the lung parenchyma was markedly reduced and lung function significantly improved. Manipulation of the homeostatic control of myeloid cells by inflammatory mediators therefore represents a novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of influenza virus infection.

First test of Lorentz violation with a reactor-based antineutrino experiment
We present a search for Lorentz violation with 8249 candidate electron antineutrino events taken by the Double Chooz experiment in 227.9 live days of running. This analysis, featuring a search for a sidereal time dependence of the events, is the first test of Lorentz invariance using a reactor-based antineutrino source. No sidereal variation is present in the data and the disappearance results are consistent with sidereal time independent oscillations. Under the Standard-Model Extension, we set the first limits on 14 Lorentz violating coefficients associated with transitions between electron and tau flavor, and set two competitive limits associated with transitions between electron and muon flavor.

Developing resources to support the diagnosis and management of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalitis (CFS/ME) in primary care: a qualitative study.
BACKGROUND: NICE guidelines emphasise the need for a confident, early diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/ Myalgic Encephalitis (CFS/ME) in Primary Care with management tailored to the needs of the patient. Research suggests that GPs are reluctant to make the diagnosis and resources for management are currently inadequate. This study aimed to develop resources for practitioners and patients to support the diagnosis and management of CFS/ME in primary care. METHODS: Semi structured interviews were conducted with patients, carers, GPs, practice nurses and CFS/ME specialists in North West England. All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and analysed qualitatively using open explorative thematic coding. Two patient involvement groups were consulted at each stage of the development of resources to ensure that the resources reflect everyday issues faced by people living with CFS/ME. RESULTS: Patients and carers stressed the importance of recognising CFS/ME as a legitimate condition, and the need to be believed by health care professionals. GPs and practice nurses stated that they do not always have the knowledge or skills to diagnose and manage the condition. They expressed a preference for an online training package. For patients, information on getting the most out of a consultation and the role of carers was thought to be important. Patients did not want to be overloaded with information at diagnosis, and suggested information should be given in steps. A DVD was suggested, to enable information sharing with carers and family, and also for those whose symptoms act as a barrier to reading. CONCLUSION: Rather than use a top-down approach to the development of training for health care practitioners and information for patients and carers, we have used data from key stakeholders to develop a patient DVD, patient leaflets to guide symptom management and a modular e-learning resource which should equip GPs to diagnose and manage CFS/ME effectively, meet NICE guidelines and give patients acceptable, evidence-based information.

[cocl2, cell, metabolism, model, pde4d, oscc, hypoxium, hypoxic, effect, hif-1]

A systems biology approach for investigating oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)
A systems biology approach was adopted in order to assess various aspects of the disease oral squamous cell carcinoma.  Three main aims were addressed; assess the ability of CoCl2 to mimic the hypoxic response in a eukaryotic cell line, assess the role of PDE4D in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and the construction of a normoxic/hypoxic mathematical model to identify therapeutic targets.Cancer cells often acquire a revised metabolism which aids in initiation, survival and progression of the tumour. This is predominantly due to the transcription factor HIF-1 which is activated under hypoxic conditions. Certain compounds such as cobalt chloride (CoCl2) have been used extensively to inhibit the degradation of HIF-1α and simulate hypoxia. CoCl2 is likely to have off-target effects on metabolism; these effects were examined when exposing human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) cells to 100μM CoCl2. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based metabolomics were utilised in combination with ELISA assays for HIF-1α and ATP. Central metabolism was accurately mimicked when hTERT cells were subjected to 100μM CoCl2, however; it was apparent that this concentration of CoCl2 does not induce an equal extent of hypoxia as 1% oxygen. A number of off-target effects of CoCl2 were observed in secondary metabolism, specifically in lipids and fatty acids. In conclusion, CoCl2 should be used with caution as a hypoxic mimicker with the caveat that interpretation of results should be restricted to its effects on central metabolism.The transcription factor CREB has the ability to regulate approximately 4000 genes, a number of which are associated with cancer initiation and progression. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is required to activate CREB and is partially regulated through its degradation via the enzyme phosphodiesterase type 4D (PDE4D). A homozygous deletion of PDE4D has been associated with OSCC; however; the exact consequence of this deletion has not been fully elucidated. PDE4D was knocked down in the OSCC cell line BicR16 and cellular proliferation, migration, resistance to ionising radiation and central metabolism was investigated using MTT, scratch, clonogenic and GC-MS, respectively. The knockdown resulted in an increase in proliferation, migration and radiation resistance suggesting the role of PDE4D as a TSG. Amino acids, cholesterol, fatty acids, carbohydrates and TCA intermediates were found to be altered in concentration.A mathematical model of glycolysis, TCA and glutaminolysis under normoxia and hypoxia was constructed through the amalgamation of two established models from the literature. New reactions, parameters and metabolite concentrations were added and unnecessary entities were deleted. COmplex PAthway SImulator (COPASI) was utilised to construct the model before validating the model using experimental data from the literature and steady state and flux analyses. Sensitivity analysis and a reduction in external glucose and glutamine were mimicked and the alterations in hypoxic and normoxic metabolism analysed. The reactions vCSII, vGS, vPGK and vGII were identified as potential therapeutic targets which may affect metabolism in hypoxia only. However, certain validation methods proved unsuccessful and hence the model requires further work before attempting the analyses again.

The influence of dietary intake on the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system across three ethnic groups: a population-based study.
OBJECTIVE: The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system has been implicated in the aetiopathogenesis of cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Since dietary factors and ethnicity are considered contributory to the development of these diseases, we examined the IGF system in relation to nutritional intake by ethnic group. DESIGN, SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Dietary intake in 257 subjects of White European, African-Caribbean and Pakistani ethnic origin living in Manchester, UK was assessed using ethnic-group-specific food-frequency questionnaires to assess habitual nutrient intake over the previous 12 months. Fasting IGF-I, IGF-II and IGF-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) concentrations were determined and their relationship to specific dietary constituents was analysed. RESULTS: Analysis by quintiles of nutrient intake showed a significant increase in circulating IGF-I concentration with increasing dietary fat intake (F for trend=3.9, ), saturated fat intake and for protein intake There was also a significant increase in IGF-II by quintiles of dietary protein intake There was a trend for increasing IGF-I with increasing energy intake. The relationships between circulating concentration of IGFBP-1, an acute regulator of IGF action, and fat/protein intake were opposite to those for IGF-I and IGF-II. Multiple linear regression modelling showed that people of Pakistani origin and older subjects had lower levels of IGF-I (Pakistani origin vs. others, ) (age, for both). There was an independent inverse relationship between IGF-I and dietary carbohydrate intake CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence for a dietary contribution to regulation of the IGF system, although the effects of ethnicity on circulating IGF levels remain dominant. We propose that the IGF system's influences on cancer risk in specific ethnic groups are potentially modifiable by dietary intervention.

[symptom, somatosensory, reporting, distortion, tendency, alarm, false, physical, range, patient]

Physical symptom reporting is associated with a tendency to experience somatosensory distortion
Objective: Theory suggests that a tendency to experience distortions in somatosensory awareness is associated with physical symptom reporting (i.e., somatization) but empirical evidence for this is lacking. This article describes research designed to test this hypothesis. Methods: Somatosensory distortion was operationalized as the frequency of illusory touch experiences (i.e., false alarm rate) on the Somatic Signal Detection Task. Two studies correlated false alarms on this task with physical symptom reporting on the 15-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the first using a nonclinical sample (n = 35), the second using a clinical sample of endoscopy patients who were identified as having either medically explained (n = 25) or medically unexplained symptoms (n = 30). Results: Scores on the 15-item Patient Health Questionnaire were positively correlated with false alarm rate in both studies (r = 0.288-0.506), even after controlling for trait anxiety, depression, anxiety (standardized A range = 0.793-0.932, all p < .0001) and (in Study 2) somatosensory amplification and hypochondriacal worry (standardized beta range = 0.345-0.375, both p < .05). There was no difference in false alarm rate between patients with medically explained and medically unexplained symptoms (medically explained median range = 6.8 3.7 to 6.8 4.0 versus medically unexplained median range = 4.3 3.9 to 5.6 3.1, both p > .1). Conclusions: There seems to be a robust link between physical symptom reporting and the tendency to experience somatosensory distortion, consistent with recent cognitive theories. It may be possible to reduce the impact of somatization by developing treatments that target this tendency.

Bicontinuous minimal surface nanostructures for polymer blend solar cells
This paper presents the first examination of the potential for bicontinuous structures such as the gyroid structure to produce high efficiency solar cells based on conjugated polymers. The solar cell characteristics are predicted by a simulation model that shows how the morphology influences device performance through integration of all the processes occurring in organic photocells in a specified morphology. In bicontinuous phases, the surface de. ning the interface between the electron and hole transporting phases divides the volume into two disjoint subvolumes. Exciton loss is reduced because the interface at which charge separation occurs permeates the device so excitons have only a short distance to reach the interface. As each of the component phases is connected, charges will be able to reach the electrodes more easily. In simulations of the current-voltage characteristics of organic cells with gyroid, disordered blend and vertical rod (rods normal to the electrodes) morphologies, we find that gyroids have a lower than anticipated performance advantage over disordered blends, and that vertical rods are superior. These results are explored thoroughly, with geminate recombination, i.e. recombination of charges originating from the same exciton, identified as the primary source of loss. Thus, if an appropriate materials choice could reduce geminate recombination, gyroids show great promise for future research and applications.

Regulation of Allergic Responses to Chemicals and Drugs: Possible Roles of Epigenetic Mechanisms.
There is increasing evidence that epigenetic regulation of gene expression plays a pivotal role in the orchestration of immune and allergic responses. Such regulatory mechanisms have potentially important implications for the acquisition of sensitization to chemical and drug allergens, and in determining the vigor, characteristics and longevity of allergic responses. Importantly, the discovery of long-lasting epigenetic alterations in specific immunoregulatory genes provides a mechanistic basis for immune cell memory, and thereby the potential of chemical allergens to influence the subsequent orientation of the adaptive immune system. In this article we consider the implications of epigenetic mechanisms for the development of sensitization to chemical and drug allergens and the form that allergic reactions will take.

We demonstrate the necessity of these couplings to suppress spurious spin excitations owing to the spin-orbit force in free translational motion of a nucleus but show that in a collision situation there is a strong spin excitation even in spin-saturated systems which persists in the departing fragments.

Gefitinib for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer.
IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a leading target for treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Recent trials of the small-molecule EGFR inhibitor gefitinib have now more clearly defined indications for usage, and clinical and molecular factors predictive of benefit. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: A systematic search of the literature (Medline, ASCO, WCLC meeting abstracts) was performed from January 2000 to January 2010. The Phase III INTEREST study found gefitinib in unselected, pretreated patients was not inferior to docetaxel chemotherapy in overall survival, offering improved quality of life and superior toxicity profile. The Phase III IPASS study demonstrated improved progression-free survival with gefitinib compared with paclitaxel-carboplatin chemotherapy in chemotherapy-naive, never/light ex-smokers with adenocarcinoma histology. Stratifying for EGFR mutation revealed mutation-positive patients had superior outcomes with gefitinib compared with chemotherapy. Subsequent studies (WJOG4305, NEJ002), selecting only EGFR mutation-positive patients prospectively confirm this finding. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: The profile of gefitinib and landmark trials in NSCLC are summarized. How biomarkers may further optimize therapeutic benefit is highlighted. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Gefitinib is expected to have an important impact on management of pretreated and selected chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced NSCLC. In addition, activating EGFR mutations are proven to be of value for prediction of those who will derive most benefit.

In this paper we present ASCOT, an efficient search application for clinical trials that is designed to aid writing new trials. Clinical trials are protocols describing medical research on humans. Although they are a valuable source of medical practice evidence, search is laborious due to the immense number of existing protocols. Writing a new trial includes composing detailed eligibility criteria, which might be time-consuming, especially for new researchers. ASCOT uses text mining and data mining methods to enrich clinical trials with metadata, that can be employed to narrow down search. In addition, ASCOT integrates an eligibility criteria recommendation component.

[particle, size, primary, model, bl, aerosol, uncertainty]

Primary versus secondary contributions to particle number concentrations in the European boundary layer
It is important to understand the relative contribution of primary and secondary particles to regional and global aerosol so that models can attribute aerosol radiative forcing to different sources. In large-scale models, there is considerable uncertainty associated with treatments of particle formation (nucleation) in the boundary layer (BL) and in the size distribution of emitted primary particles, leading to uncertainties in predicted cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations. Here we quantify how primary particle emissions and secondary particle formation influence size-resolved particle number concentrations in the BL using a global aerosol microphysics model and aircraft and ground site observations made during the May 2008 campaign of the European Integrated Project on Aerosol Cloud Climate Air Quality Interactions (EUCAARI). We tested four different parameterisations for BL nucleation and two assumptions for the emission size distribution of anthropogenic and wildfire carbonaceous particles. When we emit carbonaceous particles at small sizes (as recommended by the Aerosol Inter-comparison project, AEROCOM), the spatial distributions of campaign-mean number concentrations of particles with diameter >50 nm (N-50) and >100 nm (N-100) were well captured by the model (R-2 >= 0.8) and the normalised mean bias (NMB) was also small (-18\% for N-50 and -1\% for N-100). Emission of carbonaceous particles at larger sizes, which we consider to be more realistic for low spatial resolution global models, results in equally good correlation but larger bias (R-2 >= 0.8, NMB = -52\% and -29\%), which could be partly but not entirely compensated by BL nucleation. Within the uncertainty of the observations and accounting for the uncertainty in the size of emitted primary particles, BL nucleation makes a statistically significant contribution to CCN-sized particles at less than a quarter of the ground sites. Our results show that a major source of uncertainty in CCN-sized particles in polluted European air is the emitted size of primary carbonaceous particles. New information is required not just from direct observations, but also to determine the ``effective emission size{''} and composition of primary particles appropriate for different resolution models.

Manipulation of immunity to and pathology of respiratory infections.
Respiratory infections are the third leading cause of death worldwide and are a priority for vaccine development. Immune defence mechanisms are critical in recovery from most respiratory infections but the role of the immune system in causing bystander lung injury is not as well understood, and will be the focus of this review. Immune-mediated injury results from physical occlusion of the airways or the ensuing 'cytokine storm', which may spill over into the systemic circulation and cause devastating consequences. Respiratory pathogens employ numerous strategies to avoid detection by the immune system. One of these, the alteration of key surface determinants, makes the design of rational vaccines problematic. In the following review the immune compartments responsible for clinical lung disease are discussed, and current and novel strategies to reduce their potency are overviewed.

[gik, meta-analysis, therapy, patient, ami, trial]

A meta-analysis of glucose-insulin-potassium therapy for treatment of acute myocardial infarction.
BACKGROUND: Glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) therapy has been proposed to provide metabolic support to ischemic myocardium. A meta-analysis that included 1932 patients performed 10 years previously demonstrated that GIK therapy may have an important role in reducing mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Since then, many larger randomized trials investigating the role of GIK in the setting of AMI have been published; hence, the present study repeats the previous meta-analysis performed by the current authors to include these trials. METHOD AND RESULTS: A systematic MEDLINE search for all randomized, placebo-controlled studies of GIK therapy in the setting of AMI was conducted and a meta-analysis of the mortality data was performed. A total of 16 randomized trials from 1966 to 2008 were identified, with 28,374 patients included in the current meta-analysis. There was a total of 1367 deaths (9.6%) in the GIK group, with 1351 deaths (9.6%) in the control group. Meta-analysis did not reveal any benefit from GIK treatment (OR 1.0; 95% CI 0.9 to 1.1; P=0.9). Subgroup analysis of patients given high-dose GIK and in patients in whom reperfusion was not obtained did not demonstrate a benefit from GIK therapy. CONCLUSION: A meta-analysis of 16 randomized trials that spanned 40 years and involved more than 28,000 patients did not reveal any mortality benefit for ST segment elevation AMI using GIK therapy when data from the modern thrombolysis/primary percutaneous coronary intervention era were included.

[response, cell, flagellin, lung, tlr5, radioresistant, tlr4, immune, respiratory, innate]

Radioresistant cells expressing TLR5 control the respiratory epithelium's innate immune responses to flagellin.
Bacterial products (such as endotoxins and flagellin) trigger innate immune responses through TLRs. Flagellin-induced signalling involves TLR5 and MyD88 and, according to some reports, TLR4. Whereas epithelial and dendritic cells are stimulated by flagellin in vitro, the cell contribution to the in vivo response is still unclear. Here, we studied the respective roles of radioresistant and radiosensitive cells in flagellin-induced airway inflammation in mice. We found that i.n. delivery of flagellin elicits a transient change in respiratory function and an acute, pro-inflammatory response in the lungs, characterized by TLR5- and MyD88-dependent chemokine secretion and neutrophil recruitment. In contrast, TLR4, CD14 and TRIF were not essential for flagellin-mediated responses, indicating that TLR4 does not cooperate with TLR5 in the lungs. Respiratory function, chemokine secretion and airway infiltration by neutrophils were dependent on radioresistant, TLR5-expressing cells. Furthermore, lung haematopoietic cells also responded to flagellin by activating TNF-alpha production. We suggest that the radioresistant lung epithelial cells are essential for initiating early, TLR5-dependent signalling in response to flagellin and thus triggering the lung's innate immune responses.

[itch, temporal, signal, gyrus, study]

A temporal analysis of the central neural processing of itch.
BACKGROUND: Pruritus, or itch, is the most prevalent symptom of allergic and inflammatory skin disease. Although it is known that itch induces activation of a neural network in the brain, the temporal dynamics of the network as well as the pathophysiology and neurobiology are not well understood. OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to elucidate (i) the temporal dynamics of the itch response identified in earlier studies and (ii) the relationship between central and subjective responses to itch. METHODS: Using a novel time-series analysis, we performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, within-subject functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of the cerebral processing of histamine-induced itch in healthy volunteers (n = 16) by tracking the 8-min period following a single skin prick. RESULTS: Histamine-induced itch compared with saline resulted in significant area under the curve blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal changes in the middle/superior temporal gyrus and right inferior frontal gyrus/insula. We observed negative itch-induced BOLD signal changes compared with saline in (i) the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)/medial frontal gyrus, (ii) subgenual ACC/ventral striatum, (iii) bilateral temporal pole/parahippocampal gyrus and (iv) several regions within the cerebellum. We noted a trend significance in the left precentral gyrus part of the motor cortex. The BOLD signal change in several of these regions correlated with perception of itch intensity. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to other fMRI studies we observed a multifocal negative signal. An improved understanding of both activated and deactivated brain regions during the itch response may in the long term facilitate development of more effective management strategies.

A common pathway for age-related protein oxidation and photoageing
Remodelling of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins as a result of solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure plays a key role in skin photoageing. We have recently demonstrated that UVR-chromophore-rich fibrillin microfibrils undergo photodegradation following UV irradiation in a cell-free environment. In this study, we test the hypotheses that fibrillin microfibril degradation following UVR exposure: i) occurs via the photodynamic production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and; ii) alters the susceptibility of resultant microfibril photoproducts to protease-mediated degradation.   Fibrillin microfibrils were isolated from cultured human dermal fibroblasts. Microfibril structure after UVB irradiation (Phillips TL-12 source; 500mJ/cm2) in ambient and O2-depleted conditions or after treatment with H2O2 (40mM; up to 2hrs) was quantified by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The effect of UVB irradiation (50mJ/cm2) on the susceptibility of microfibrils to MMP-3 proteolysis was also quantified by AFM.   In ambient oxygen, UVB irradiation caused a dose-dependent decrease in median fibrillin microfibril flexion angle. However, in an O2-depleted environment the UVB mediated effects were significantly abrogated. Structural changes were mimicked by exposure to H2O2.    Individually, UVB or MMP-3 significantly decreased the median microfibril flexion angle. However, addition of MMP-3 to UVB irradiated microfibrils appeared to selectively degrade low flexion angle fibrillin microfibrils leaving a population with a median flexion angle that was not significantly different to the controls.   These observations suggest that UVB degradation involves the photodynamic formation of ROS and that exposure to H2O2 can mimic the effects of UVB degradation. Furthermore, MMP-3 appears to selectively degrade UVB-damaged fibrillin microfibrils in vitro

The border sequence of the balhimycin biosynthesis gene cluster from Amycolatopsis balhimycina contains bbr, encoding a StrR-like pathway-specific regulator
Balhimycin, produced by the actinomycete Amycolatopsis balhimycina DSM5908, is a glycopeptide antibiotic highly similar to vancomycin, the antibiotic of 'last resort' used for the treatment of resistant Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria. Partial sequence of the balhimycin biosynthesis gene cluster was previously reported. In this work, cosmids which overlap the region of the characterized gene cluster were isolated and sequenced. At the 'left' end of the cluster, genes were identified which are involved in balhimycin biosynthesis, transport, resistance and regulation. The 'right' end border is defined by a putative 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (dahp) gene. The proximate gene is similar to a type I polyketide synthase gene of the rifamycin producer Amycolatopsis mediterranei indicating that another biosynthesis gene cluster might be located directly next to the balhimycin gene cluster. The newly identified StrR-like pathway-specific regulator, Bbr, was characterized to be a DNA-binding protein and may have a role in balhimycin biosynthesis. Purified N-terminally His-tagged Bbr shows specific DNA-binding to five promoter regions within the gene cluster. By in silico analysis and by comparison of the DNA sequences binding Bbr, conserved inverted repeat sequences for the Bbr-binding site are proposed. The putative Bbr consensus sequence differs from that published for StrR. Copyright ?? 2007 S. Karger AG.

Challenging Anti-migrant Moral Panic Discourses: The Role of Migrants and Trade Unions as Folk Devils Fighting Stigmatisation
As a result of the 2004 European Union enlargement the United Kingdom witnessed inflow of economic migrants from Eastern European countries (A8 countries) with the consequences that British public institutions related to social security system, housing, labor policy and social cohesion have experienced significant pressure. It is estimated that around 1 million A8 migrants, with the majority of Poles (66 percent) have arrived in Britain and have attempted successfully or unsuccessfully to find an employment mostly as catering assistants, packers, farm workers, domestic staff, food processing operatives, chefs, bus drivers, food packers and delivery drivers. Because of the growing number of A8 migrants, in some sectors of indigenous British society there has developed a complex set of anxious societal reactions triggered by this challenge. The following article will focus on societal reactions to economic migrants, namely, it will examine the interactions between anti A8 migrants moral panic proponents and targeted as folk devils A8 migrants who attempted to fight back against stigmatization. Further, it will be explored the crucial role of British trade unions which campaigned on behalf of A8 migrants folk devils and were committed to give them a voice. This analysis, on the one hand, aims to contribute to the development of moral panic concept, on the other, it examines the evolution of subject positions of both A8 migrants and trade union campaigners in the context of post-foundational society.

Metabolomic analysis of a synthetic metabolic switch in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2)
The global analysis of metabolism by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry is often hampered by a large amount of biological and technical variability. Here, we introduce an experimental and analytical strategy that can produce robust metabolome profiles in the face of this challenge. By applying a new computational approach based on concordance analysis to an extremely large number of analytical replicates, we are able to show that the overexpression of an antisense non-coding {RNA} targeting glutamine synthetase I results in a major reorganization of the metabolism of Streptomyces coelicolor, the model species of antibiotic-producing bacteria. We identified 97 metabolites with statistically significant reproducible dynamic behavior across the time series. The observed metabolic changes are very rapid, specific and widespread across metabolism, but focus on the nitrogen assimilation pathways. Our results demonstrate the power of highly replicated experimental designs for the robust characterization of metabolite dynamics. The identified global rearrangement of metabolism suggests the usefulness of {RNA} interference as an efficient strategy to manipulate the physiology of bacteria with wider biotechnological applicability in microorganisms. ?? 2011 {WILEY-VCH} Verlag {GmbH} \& Co. {KGaA}, Weinheim.

[csf, meningitis, rhinorrhea, case]

Does Meningitis Stop CSF Rhinorrhea following Lateral Skull Base Surgery?
In cases of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea following lateral skull base surgery, fibrosis and fibrin formation resulting from meningitis has been postulated as a mechanism of spontaneously resolving the CSF leak. This study was undertaken to explore any possible relationship between the cessation of CSF leak and meningitis. A retrospective study at a tertiary referral center of 232 consecutive patients was performed. Out of a total of 232 procedures, 29 patients developed CSF rhinorrhea, of whom 7 subsequently developed meningitis. Bacteria were isolated in CSF obtained at lumbar puncture in 5 cases, with the CSF analysis in the remaining 2 cases suggesting aseptic meningitis. Conservative treatment failed to stop the CSF rhinorrhea in 6 of 7 cases. In this study, the development of meningitis did not appear to aid in the resolution of the CSF rhinorrhea. We conclude that surgical intervention should not be delayed in the expectation that meningitis and conservative interventions may promote CSF leak resolution.

Accuracy of diagnostic coding of hospital admissions for cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis.
To determine the accuracy of diagnostic coding of cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, the case notes of 166 admissions to four hospitals were reviewed. These consisted of all admissions that had been coded as "idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis" (ICD code 516.3: 97 admissions) or as "postinflammatory pulmonary fibrosis" (ICD code 515.9: 69 admissions). Of 88 available records of admissions coded as idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis, 70 (80%) patients had definite cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, and six (7%) possible cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis according to predetermined conventional clinical criteria. Only seven (8%) admissions were clearly coded wrongly. Sixty four records were available for patients coded as having postinflammatory pulmonary fibrosis; 16 (25%) of these patients had definite cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, a further 12 (19%) had possible cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis or fibrosing alveolitis with a connective tissue disorder, and the remainder had a very wide range of diagnoses. In this study the idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis (ICD 516.3) code was relatively reliable, but a substantial proportion of admissions coded under postinflammatory pulmonary fibrosis (ICD 515.9) also had cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis and code 515.9 was of little diagnostic value. The data are inadequate for case finding, though in respect of cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis may be adequate for planning purposes. There continues to be a need for more medical input into the process of diagnostic coding.

The role of VEGF in lung function
AbstractUniversity of ManchesterSubmitted by Jenny HankinsonFor the degree of PhD and entitled “The role of VEGF in lung function”December 2012Background: Lung function is a highly heritable trait. So far there is limited knowledge of the genetic factors that influence lung function. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) is expressed in the lung at high levels and is known to play a role in angiogenesis and lung remodelling, both in utero and throughout life. A candidate gene study was carried out in order to investigate the role of variants within the VEGF-A gene in determining lung function in childhood and adult life.Methods: Using available longitudinal data previously collected for an unselected birth cohort (Manchester Asthma and Allergy Study-MAAS) the relationship between lung function and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VEGF-A was assessed. Replication studies were performed in cross-sectional studies of adults from Manchester and children with asthma from Croatia, in whom FEV1/FVC ratio was measured using spirometry. The potential functional roles of two consistently associated SNPs were then further investigated. Finally, using the genome-wide data generated in the discovery cohort (MAAS) I assessed why associations between VEGF-A and lung function had not been reported in recent genome-wide association studies of lung function.Results: Two VEGF-A SNPs, rs10434 and rs3025028, were significantly associated with lung function at multiple ages in a discovery population (MAAS). Subjects with a GG genotype for either SNP had significantly diminished lung function compared to subjects with other genotypes. These findings were replicated in two additional populations (631 parents of children participating in MAAS and in 410 Croatian children with physician-diagnosed asthma aged 6-18 years). SNP rs10434 is located in the 3’UTR and based on its location I hypothesised that it may affect mRNA stability. No significant difference in the rate of VEGF-A mRNA degradation was found between GG and the AA homozygotes. SNP rs3025028 is an intronic SNP in a close proximity to the splice site involved in alternative splicing which generates two different isoforms of VEGF-A; I therefore tested the hypothesis that a change of base at this position could affect the splicing mechanism and cause a change in the ratio of the isoforms. Western blot analysis was used to demonstrate a difference in the ratio of the splice variants VEGF-A165b and total VEGF-A165 (relative to a reference sample) between genotype groups. The VEGF-A165b/panVEGF-A165 ratio was significantly higher at birth (cord plasma), in school-age children and in adults amongst CC compared to GG homozygotes at rs3025038 (p<0.03). Finally, the genome-wide data for the discovery cohort showed that the region containing VEGF-A was not well targeted by either genotyped or imputed SNPs in genome-wide arrays. Conclusion: Evidence was provided to demonstrate that variants within the VEGF-A gene are significantly associated with lung function in both children and adults. Furthermore, data was presented to support a functional role for one of the SNPs (rs3025028). I investigated why associations between VEGF-A and lung function had not previously been reported in recent GWAS and concluded that the region containing VEGF-A was poorly covered by all of the currently available arrays.

The role of school and individual differences in the academic attainment of learners with special educational needs and disabilities: a multi-level analysis.
Students with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) are at a greatly increased risk of poor academic outcomes. Understanding the factors that influence their attainment is a crucial first step towards developing more effective provision. In the current study we present a multi-level, natural variation analysis which highlights important determinants at school and individual levels in two core academic subjects (English and Maths) using a nationally representative sample of over 15,000 students with SEND attending more than 400 schools across England. We found that at the school level, inclusivity, attainment, free school meal (FSM) eligibility, behaviour (in primary schools) and linguistic diversity (secondary schools), and at the student level, age, sex, FSM eligibility, SEND provision, SEND primary need, attendance, behaviour and positive relationships each contributed to the distribution of academic attainment. Implications of these findings are discussed and study limitations are noted.

Creating, documenting and sharing network models.
As computational neuroscience matures, many simulation environments are available that are useful for neuronal network modeling. However, methods for successfully documenting models for publication and for exchanging models and model components among these projects are still under development. Here we briefly review existing software and applications for network model creation, documentation and exchange. Then we discuss a few of the larger issues facing the field of computational neuroscience regarding network modeling and suggest solutions to some of these problems, concentrating in particular on standardized network model terminology, notation, and descriptions and explicit documentation of model scaling. We hope this will enable and encourage computational neuroscientists to share their models more systematically in the future.

Transcriptional evidence for the "Reverse Warburg Effect" in human breast cancer tumor stroma and metastasis: similarities with oxidative stress, inflammation, Alzheimer's disease, and "Neuron-Glia Metabolic Coupling".
Caveolin-1 (-/-) null stromal cells are a novel genetic model for cancer-associated fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Here, we used an unbiased informatics analysis of transcriptional gene profiling to show that Cav-1 (-/-) bone-marrow derived stromal cells bear a striking resemblance to the activated tumor stroma of human breast cancers. More specifically, the transcriptional profiles of Cav-1 (-/-) stromal cells were most closely related to the primary tumor stroma of breast cancer patients that had undergone lymph-node (LN) metastasis. This is consistent with previous morphological data demonstrating that a loss of stromal Cav-1 protein (by immuno-histochemical staining in the fibroblast compartment) is significantly associated with increased LN-metastasis. We also provide evidence that the tumor stroma of human breast cancers shows a transcriptional shift towards oxidative stress, DNA damage/repair, inflammation, hypoxia, and aerobic glycolysis, consistent with the "Reverse Warburg Effect". Finally, the tumor stroma of "metastasis-prone" breast cancer patients was most closely related to the transcriptional profiles derived from the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. This suggests that certain fundamental biological processes are common to both an activated tumor stroma and neuro-degenerative stress. These processes may include oxidative stress, NO over-production (peroxynitrite formation), inflammation, hypoxia, and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are thought to occur in Alzheimer?s disease pathology. Thus, a loss of Cav-1 expression in cancer-associated myofibroblasts may be a protein biomarker for oxidative stress, aerobic glycolysis, and inflammation, driving the "Reverse Warburg Effect" in the tumor micro-environment and cancer cell metastasis.

Considerations in developing and delivering a non-pharmacological intervention for symptom management in lung cancer: the views of health care professionals.
BACKGROUND: A respiratory distress symptom cluster has recently been identified in lung cancer associated with breathlessness, cough and fatigue, and the study reported here is part of a wider body of work being undertaken to develop a novel non-pharmacological intervention (NPI) for the management of this symptom cluster. The current paper reports the views of health care professionals (HCPs) involved with cancer care regarding the most appropriate ways of developing and delivering such a novel intervention. METHODS: Five focus groups, supplemented with additional telephone interviews, were conducted with a range of both community- and acute-based HCPs involved in symptom management for lung cancer patients. Participants included oncologists, palliative care consultants, specialist nurses, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. The focus groups were transcribed verbatim and analysed using NVIVO to support a framework analysis approach. RESULTS: The current delivery of NPIs was found to be ad hoc and varied between sites both in terms of what was delivered and by which health care professionals. The provision of NPIs within acute medical settings faced common problems concerning staffing time and space, and there was a recognition that the preference of most patients to make as few hospital visits as possible also complicated NPI teaching. Moreover, there may only be a small window of opportunity in which to effectively teach lung cancer patients a novel NPI as the period between diagnosis and the onset of severe symptoms is often short. DISCUSSION: The participants agreed that the novel symptom management NPI should be individually personalised to the needs of each patient and be available for patients when they become receptive to it. Moreover, they agreed that the intervention would be most effective if delivered to patients individually rather than in groups, outside acute medical settings where possible and closer to patient's homes, should be delivered by an HCP rather than a trained volunteer or lay person and should involve informal carers wherever practicable.

[immune, bacterial, innate, cd200r, mouse, influenza, infection, virus, cell, cd200]

Lowering the threshold of lung innate immune cell activation alters susceptibility to secondary bacterial superinfection.
BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that the interaction of CD200R, a myeloid inhibitory receptor, with its ligand, CD200, is critical in the control of innate immune activation in the lung. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a mouse model of bacterial superinfection following influenza, we show that an absence of CD200R (a negative regulator highly expressed by macrophages and dendritic cells), restricts commensal and exogenous bacterial invasiveness and completely prevents the mortality observed in wild-type mice. This benefit is due to a heightened innate immune response to influenza virus in cd200r knockout mice that limits immune pathogenesis and viral load. In wild-type mice, apoptotic cells expressing CD200 that we believe contribute to the suppressed innate immune response to bacteria dominate during the resolution phase of influenza-induced inflammation. We also show for the first time the presence of a variety of previously unidentified bacterial species in the lower airways that are significantly adjusted by influenza virus infection and may contribute to the pathophysiology of disease. CONCLUSIONS: The interaction of CD200 with CD200R therefore contributes to the hyporesponsive innate immune state following influenza virus infection that predisposes to secondary bacterial infection, a phenomenon that has the potential for immune modulation.

[neutrophil, migration, il-1, platelet, lp, response, brain, important]

The role of platelet-derived interleukin-1 alpha as a driver of neutrophil migration in vivo.
Neuroinflammation is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of many neurological diseases. A key component of the innate immune response in the central nervous system is the migration of neutrophils into the brain parenchyma, where they exacerbate neuronal injury and worsen clinical outcome. A greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying neutrophil influx into the brain may aid the development of novel therapeutic interventions for the variety of diseases to which neutrophils contribute, notably including stroke and epilepsy. In vitro evidence implicates the pro- inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1α (IL-1α), derived from platelets as a key mediator of cerebrovascular inflammation and neutrophil migration across brain endothelial cells.The aim of the work in this thesis was to test if this mechanism is important in vivo.We investigated the contribution of platelets and IL-1 in a murine model of neutrophil migration into the peritoneal cavity in response to injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Depletion of platelets abrogated the migration of neutrophils in response to LPS- induced peritonitis, indicating an important role for platelets in the process. Genetic knockout of IL-1 had no effect on neutrophil influx, demonstrating that migration in the peritoneum occurs independently of IL-1.The discovery that neutrophil migration in LPS-induced peritonitis was independent of IL-1 contrasted with the finding that platelet-derived IL-1 was a mediator of neutrophil influx across mouse brain endothelial cells in vitro. The question arose as to whether IL-1 was required as a mediator of neutrophil migration in extra-cerebral tissues. Hence, we tested the contribution of platelets and IL-1 in two further in vivo models of neutrophil migration: LPS injection into a subcutaneous air pouch, and acute lung injury induced by LPS inhalation. Platelet depletion significantly reduced neutrophil migration into the air pouch in response to LPS, yet had no effect in acute lung injury. This indicated that neutrophil migration into the air pouch was dependent on platelets, and that migration into the lungs was platelet-independent. LPS induced the same degree of neutrophil migration in wild-type and IL-1 knockout mice, demonstrating that IL-1 was not required for neutrophil migration in either model.To determine the contribution of platelets and IL-1 to neutrophil migration in response to cerebrovascular inflammation, we injected LPS into the mouse striatum. In this model, neutrophil influx to the brain parenchyma in response to LPS was reduced by depletion of circulating platelets, and inhibition of the platelet adhesion molecule, GpIb. Genetic knockout of IL-1α significantly reduced the number of invading neutrophils induced by LPS. These data confirmed that both platelets and IL-1α were important contributors to cerebral neutrophil migration in vivo. To determine whether platelets in systemic circulation may be the source of IL-1α, we treated mice with IL-1 receptor antagonist or anti-IL-1 antibodies to block systemic IL-1 action. Neither intervention affected cerebral neutrophil migration in response to LPS, suggesting that the IL-1α that mediates neutrophil migration may originate in the brain.Overall, these data demonstrate that IL-1α and platelets make an important contribution to neutrophil migration to the brain, yet independently of each other. Our data also suggest there may be specific mechanisms driving innate immune responses in vivo even in response to the same inflammatory stimulus.

Can Early Burkholderia cepacia Complex Infection in Cystic Fibrosis be Eradicated with Antibiotic Therapy?
Introduction: Organisms of the Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) are important pathogens in cystic fibrosis (CF). The majority of those who acquire BCC develop chronic infection but it can also result in rapid decline in a significant minority. In addition, chronic infection with Burkholderia cenocepacia in particular is regarded as a contraindication to lung transplantation in many units. Whilst aggressive antibiotic therapy is employed in CF to eradicate Pseudomonas aeruginosa before infection becomes irreversibly established, no formal assessment of such strategies has been previously reported for BCC, despite the apparent widespread adoption of this practice. Methods: UK adult CF centers were surveyed about their current approach to new BCC infection. Outcomes of eradication therapy were assessed in patients attending the Manchester Adult CF Center with new BCC isolates between 1st January 2002 and 1st May 2011. Patients with previous infection with the same strain of BCC were excluded. BCC were identified at the national reference laboratories and confirmed by species-specific PCR and RecA sequencing. Results: Routine use of therapies to attempt eradication of new BCC is commonly used in the UK (12/17 centers who responded). This typically involves a combination of intravenous and nebulised antibiotics. Of 19 eligible cases of new BCC infection, the organism has been eradicated in 7 (37%). Three of these did not receive specific eradication therapy. Of 14 patients who have received eradication therapy and completed follow up, BCC were cleared in only 4 (29%). Conclusions: Attempted eradication of new BCC is a common practice in UK adult CF centers. A minority of patients clear the infection spontaneously and the effects of eradication therapies are at best modest. Early treatment may be associated with better outcomes, though there are insufficient data to support the use of any specific treatment regimen. A prospective, systematic evaluation of treatments and outcomes is required.

Seeding of the nematic-isotropic phase transition by an electric field
<p>In this paper, we use a relatively simple continuum model to investigate the effects of dielectric inhomogeneity within confined liquid crystal cells. Specifically, we consider, in planar, cylindrical and spherical geometries, the stability of a nematic-isotropic interface subject to an applied voltage. Depending on the magnitude of this voltage, the temperature and the geometry of the cell, the nematic region may shrink until the material is completely isotropic within the cell, grow until the nematic phase cells the cell or, in certain geometries, coexist with the isotropic phase. For planar geometry, no coexistence is found, but we are able to give analytical expressions for the critical voltage for an electric-field-induced phase transition as well as the critical wetting layer thickness for arbitrary applied voltage. In cells with cylindrical and spherical geometries, however, stable nematic-isotropic coexistence is predicted, the thickness of the nematic region being controllable by alteration of the applied voltage.</p>

Hypnotherapy in severe irritable bowel syndrome: further experience.
Fifteen patients with severe intractable irritable bowel syndrome previously reported as successfully treated with hypnotherapy, have now been followed up for a mean duration of 18 months. All patients remain in remission although two have experienced a single relapse overcome by an additional session of hypnotherapy. Experience with a further 35 patients is reported giving a total group of 50. This group was divided into classical cases, atypical cases and cases exhibiting significant psychopathology. The response rates were 95%, 43%, and 60% respectively. Patients over the age of 50 years responded very poorly (25%) whereas those below the age of 50 with classical irritable bowel syndrome exhibited a 100% response rate. This study confirms the successful effect of hypnotherapy in a larger series of patients with irritable bowel syndrome and defines some subgroup variations.

Urocortin inhibits Beclin1-mediated autophagic cell death in cardiac myocytes exposed to ischaemia/reperfusion injury.
Autophagy is known to be a feature of cardiomyopathies and chronic ischaemia. Here we demonstrate that autophagy is also induced by a single cycle of ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R in neonatal and adult rat cardiac myocytes). Consistent with the critical role for Beclin1 in autophagocytosis, reduction of Beclin1 expression in cardiac myocytes by RNAi reduces I/R-induced autophagy and this is associated with enhanced cell survival. Autophagy is also reduced by urocortin, an endogenous cardiac peptide which we have previously shown to reduce other forms of myocyte cell death induced by I/R. The inhibition of autophagy by urocortin is mediated in part by inhibition of Beclin1 expression, an effect which is mediated by activation of the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway but which does not involve activation of p42/p44 MAPK.

The detection of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in lung tissue from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a clinical syndrome in which the precipitating factors are unclear. An association between Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and IPF had previously been suggested using serology and immunohistochemistry. This study sought confirmation of the presence of EBV DNA in the lung tissue of patients with IPF. Lung tissue obtained surgically from 27 patients with IPF and 28 control subjects was investigated for the presence of EBV by immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Immunohistochemistry used antibodies specific for EBV lytic cycle antigens (gp340/220 and VCA). Nested PCR analysis used oligonucleotide primers specific for EBV and was sensitive to one copy of EBV DNA. Twelve of the 27 patients with IPF (44%) and three of the 28 control subjects (10%) were EBV positive by immunohistochemistry (p = 0.005). Thirteen of the patients with IPF (48%) and four of the control subjects (14%) were EBV positive by PCR (p = 0.007). Eleven of the patients with IPF (41%) and none of the control subjects were EBV positive by both immunohistochemistry and PCR (p = < 0.001). These data further suggest an association between EBV and IPF. In addition it defines a novel method for detecting EBV in lung tissue. EBV may be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease; however, further studies are required to establish a causal relationship.

Designers' use of the artefact in human-centred design
<p>This paper highlights how artefacts can be used as an effective tool to understand users and encourage dialogue. The paper will reflect on how the role of the designer is evolving, some limitations of user-centred design and how a more holistic ‘human-centred’ design approach may be more productive. The nature and applications of artefacts in understanding users will be considered. Finally three case studies will illustrate how artefacts have been used to enable human-centred

Integrative Modelling of Glucocorticoid Induced Apoptosis with a Systems Biology Approach
Glucocorticoids (GCs) have an important role in anti-inflammation, apoptosis and immunomodulatory activity. GCs exert their effect by binding to their receptor, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which subsequently triggers receptor dimerisation, nuclear translocation and eventually causes impact on transcriptional activity. Such regulatory mechanism is complex as it is not only controlled at the transcription level, but also at the post translational level with other contributing factors such as protein stability and cofactor recruitment. Glucocorticoids are commonly used as part of the chemotherapeutical protocols for lymphoid malignancies and have been successfully implicated in treating childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Nevertheless, resistance and side effects such as muscle atrophy and osteoporosis still occur frequently.With the advance in high-throughput technology, vast amount of data on various scales, including genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics make the molecular study of cancer more complicated. The rise of systems biology helps the scientist to address this problem with the use of computation. Although the concept and the approach may vary depending on the research fields, the ultimate goal remains the same which is to create a comprehensive understanding of biological processes and to forecast outcome.The goal of this body of work is to better understand glucocorticoid induced apoptosis in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia by adopting a systems biology approach. As the Bcl-2 family, particularly Bim is known to be a key determinant of GC-induced apoptosis, we investigated the molecular mechanism of GC induction of Bim. By adopting ordinary differential equation modelling approach, we were able to make prediction and investigate details of Bim regulation by GCs. Further to this, we carried out an integrated microarray analysis in various ALL to study GC resistance and identified crucial candidate gene c-Jun as a regulator of Bim and Erg as a determinant for GC resistance. These results allowed us to refine our models and enabled more answers to be addressed. In conclusion, our findings not only suggest potential regulatory mechanisms for determining GC sensitivity, they also aid us to find potential biomarkers for determining GC resistance.   More importantly, this study represents a successful example for utilising systems biology to study the genetic complexity in cancer.

Investigation of the role of IL-1 and TNF in matrix degradation in the intervertebral disc.
OBJECTIVE: To establish if IL-1 or TNF regulates matrix degradation in the non-degenerate or degenerate intervertebral disc (IVD). METHODS: In situ zymography (ISZ) has been used to investigate the role of IL-1 and TNF in the matrix degradation characterizing symptomatic IVD degeneration. ISZ employed three substrates (gelatin, collagen II, casein) and four different challenges, IL-1beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), TNF-alpha and anti-TNF. RESULTS: We have shown for the first time that whilst IL-1beta will stimulate and IL-1 receptor antagonist will inhibit matrix degradation in intact human IVD tissue, neither TNF-alpha nor anti-TNF have any measurable effect on degradation of these matrices. CONCLUSION: This study has addressed a current area of controversy in IVD biology, namely, whether either IL-1 or TNF or both are involved in driving matrix degradation. Our data indicate that IL-1 is a key cytokine mediating matrix degradation in the IVD and therefore a therapeutic target.

Clorgyline-mediated reversal of neurological deficits in a Complexin 2 knockout mouse
Complexin 2 is a protein modulator of neurotransmitter release that is downregulated in humans suffering from depression, animal models of depression and neurological disorders such as Huntington's disease in which depression is a major symptom. Although complexin 2 knockout (Cplx2-/-) mice are overtly normal, they show significant abnormalities in cognitive function and synaptic plasticity. Here we show that Cplx2-/- mice also have disturbances in emotional behaviours that include abnormal social interactions and depressive-like behaviour. Since neurotransmitter deficiencies are thought to underlie depression, we examined neurotransmitter levels in Cplx2-/- mice and found a significant decrease in levels of noradrenaline and the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the hippocampus. Chronic treatment with clorgyline, an irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A, restored hippocampal noradrenaline to normal levels (from 60 to 97% of vehicle-treated Cplx2+/+ mice, P<0.001), and reversed the behavioural deficits seen in Cplx2-/- mice. For example, clorgyline-treated Cplx2-/- mice spent significantly more time interacting with a novel visitor mouse compared with vehicle-treated Cplx2-/- mice in the social recognition test (34 compared with 13%, P<0.01). We were also able to reverse the selective deficit seen in mossy fibre-long-term potentiation (MF-LTP) in Cplx2-/- mice using the noradrenergic agonist isoprenaline. Pre-treatment with isoprenaline in vitro increased MF-LTP by 125% (P<0.001), thus restoring it to control levels. Our data strongly support the idea that complexin 2 is a key player in normal neurological function, and that downregulation of complexin 2 could lead to changes in neurotransmitter release sufficient to cause significant behavioural abnormalities such as depression.

Three different fabrication routes for Pb/InAs planar junctions are explored and we find that the "etch-back" processing strategy is the most promising. Using the parameters extracted from the spectroscopic analysis, we find that the interface properties fall into four different regimes of behavior.</p>

Effects of polyclonal IgG derived from patients with different clinical types of the antiphospholipid syndrome on monocyte signaling pathways.
A major mechanism of hypercoagulability in the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is antiphospholipid Ab-mediated upregulation of tissue factor (TF) on monocytes via activation of TLRs, p38 MAPK, and NF-kappaB pathways. We examined whether monocyte signaling pathways are differentially activated by IgG from patients with vascular thrombosis (VT) alone compared with IgG from patients with pregnancy morbidity (PM) alone. We purified IgG from 49 subjects. A human monocyte cell line and ex vivo healthy monocytes were treated with 100 microg/ml IgG for 6 h, and cell extracts were examined by immunoblot using Abs to p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB. To further investigate intracellular signaling pathways induced by these IgGs, specific inhibitors of p38 MAPK, NF-kappaB, TLR4, and TLR2 were used to determine their effect on TF activity. Only IgG from patients with VT but no PM (VT+/PM-) caused phosphorylation of NF-kappaBand p38 MAPK and upregulation of TF activity in monocytes. These effects were not seen with IgG from patients with PM alone (VT-/PM+), anti-phospholipid Ab-positive patients without APS, or healthy controls. TF upregulation caused by the VT+/PM- samples was reduced by inhibitors of p38 MAPK, NF-kappaB, and TLR4. The effects of VT+/PM- IgG on signaling and TF upregulation were concentrated in the fraction that bound beta-2-glycoprotein I. Our findings demonstrate that IgGs from patients with diverse clinical manifestations of APS have differential effects upon phosphorylation of NF-kappaB and p38 MAPK and TF activity that may be mediated by differential activation of TLR4.

IL-17 boosts proinflammatory outcome of antiviral response in human cells.
Excessive inflammation during bacterial and viral infections is destructive to the host and involves elevated production of proinflammatory cytokines. It is especially deleterious in organs with space constraints such as lung and the CNS. Indeed, a number of viruses that infect lungs, such as avian influenza virus, SARS-associated coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus, elicit a very high level of proinflammatory cytokines; however, it is unclear what triggers their production. In this study, we show that IL-17 commonly produced during viral infection specifically augments a proinflammatory response by directly synergizing with antiviral signaling. Costimulation of primary human fibroblasts with IL-17 greatly enhanced respiratory syncytial virus-induced or synthetic dsRNA-based viral mimic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid-induced expression of proinflammatory genes without affecting expression of IFN-β-stimulated or IFN-stimulated genes. Knockdown of expression of known mediators of the antiviral signaling pathway revealed that the IL-17-poly(I:C) synergy depends on the presence of the transcriptional factors RelA and IFN regulatory factor 3 and IκB kinases. Moreover, this synergy was blocked by an IκB kinase inhibitor, BAY 11-7082. These findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms behind IL-17-dependent immunopathology observed in viral infections.

Metabolomics methods for the synthetic biology of secondary metabolism
Many microbial secondary metabolites are of high biotechnological value for medicine, agriculture, and the food industry. Bacterial genome mining has revealed numerous novel secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters, which encode the potential to synthesize a large diversity of compounds that have never been observed before. The stimulation or "awakening" of this cryptic microbial secondary metabolism has naturally attracted the attention of synthetic microbiologists, who exploit recent advances in DNA sequencing and synthesis to achieve unprecedented control over metabolic pathways. One of the indispensable tools in the synthetic biology toolbox is metabolomics, the global quantification of small biomolecules. This review illustrates the pivotal role of metabolomics for the synthetic microbiology of secondary metabolism, including its crucial role in novel compound discovery in microbes, the examination of side products of engineered metabolic pathways, as well as the identification of major bottlenecks for the overproduction of compounds of interest, especially in combination with metabolic modeling. We conclude by highlighting remaining challenges and recent technological advances that will drive metabolomics towards fulfilling its potential as a cornerstone technology of synthetic microbiology. ?? 2012 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

[irf5, macrophage, expression, gene, polarization]

IRF5 promotes inflammatory macrophage polarization and TH1-TH17 responses
Polymorphisms in the gene encoding the transcription factor IRF5 that lead to higher mRNA expression are associated with many autoimmune diseases. Here we show that IRF5 expression in macrophages was reversibly induced by inflammatory stimuli and contributed to the plasticity of macrophage polarization. High expression of IRF5 was characteristic of M1 macrophages, in which it directly activated transcription of the genes encoding interleukin 12 subunit p40 (IL-12p40), IL-12p35 and IL-23p19 and repressed the gene encoding IL-10. Consequently, those macrophages set up the environment for a potent T helper type 1 (T(H)1)-T(H)17 response. Global gene expression analysis demonstrated that exogenous IRF5 upregulated or downregulated expression of established phenotypic markers of M1 or M2 macrophages, respectively. Our data suggest a critical role for IRF5 in M1 macrophage polarization and define a previously unknown function for IRF5 as a transcriptional repressor.

Structural determinants of drugs acting on the Nav1.8 channel.
The aim of this work is to study the role of pore residues on drug binding in the Na(V)1.8 channel. Alanine mutations were made in the S6 segments, chosen on the basis of their roles in other Na(V) subtypes; whole cell patch clamp recordings were made from mammalian ND7/23 cells. Mutations of some residues caused shifts in voltage dependence of activation and inactivation, and gave faster time course of inactivation, indicating that the residues mutated play important roles in both activation and inactivation in the Na(V)1.8 channel. The resting and inactivated state affinities of tetracaine for the channel were reduced by mutations I381A, F1710A, and Y1717A (for the latter only inactivated state affinity was measured), and by mutation F1710A for the Na(V)1.8-selective compound A-803467, showing the involvement of these residues for each compound, respectively. For both compounds, mutation L1410A caused the unexpected appearance of a complete resting block even at extremely low concentrations. Resting block of native channels by compound A-803467 could be partially removed ("disinhibition") by repetitive stimulation or by a test pulse after recovery from inactivation; the magnitude of the latter effect was increased for all the mutants studied. Tetracaine did not show this effect for native channels, but disinhibition was seen particularly for mutants L1410A and F1710A. The data suggest differing, but partially overlapping, areas of binding of A-803467 and tetracaine. Docking of the ligands into a three-dimensional model of the Na(V)1.8 channel gave interesting insight as to how the ligands may interact with pore residues.

Population pharmacokinetics of conventional and intermittent dosing of liposomal amphotericin B in adults: a first critical step for rational design of innovative regimens.
There is increased interest in intermittent regimen of liposomal amphotericin B, which may facilitate use in ambulatory settings. Little is known, however, about the most appropriate dosage and schedule of administration. Plasma pharmacokinetic data were acquired from 30 patients receiving liposomal amphotericin B for empirical treatment of suspected invasive fungal infection. Two cohorts were studied. The first cohort received 3 mg of liposomal amphotericin B/kg of body weight/day; the second cohort received 10 mg of liposomal amphotericin B/kg at time zero, followed by 5 mg/kg at 48 and 120 h. The levels of liposomal amphotericin B were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The pharmacokinetics were estimated by using a population methodology. Monte Carlo simulations were performed. D-optimal design was used to identify maximally informative sampling times for both conventional and intermittent regimens for future studies. A three-compartment pharmacokinetic model best described the data. The pharmacokinetics for both conventional and intermittent dosing were linear. The estimates for the mean (standard deviation) for clearance and the volume of the central compartment were 1.60 (0.85) liter/h and 20.61 (15.27) liters, respectively. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated considerable variability in drug exposure. Bayesian estimates for clearance and volume increased in a linear manner with weight, but only the former was statistically significant (P = 0.039). D-optimal design provided maximally informative sampling times for future pharmacokinetic studies. The pharmacokinetics of a conventional and an intermittently administered high-dose regimen liposomal amphotericin B are linear. Further pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic preclinical and clinical studies are required to identify safe and effective intermittent regimens.

Unmasking of axial spondyloarthritis and oligoarthritis following discontinuation of tumour necrosis factor inhibitor therapy for psoriasis.
Psoriatic arthritis remains a common cause of morbidity in patients with psoriasis. Little is known about the natural history of the disease and dermatologists do not consistently screen for its presence. We describe a patient with severe psoriasis where long-term biologic therapy with a tumour necrosis factor inhibitor was interrupted for clinical reasons, leading to a rapidly evolving axial spondyloarthritis and oligoarthritis. This unusual presentation of psoriatic arthritis may reflect masking of the disease by long-term treatment with a tumour necrosis factor inhibitor. We advocate the use of screening for psoriatic arthritis, including before and during treatment with biologic therapies.

Dearomatising Cyclisations of Pyridine Derivatives
Pyridines react with N-acylating agents to create extremely electrophilic pyridinium ions, which are susceptible to dearomatising attack of various nucleophiles. The use of anionic nucleophiles in these cyclisations has been well documented in the literature. Recently within the Clayden group, tethered neutral π-nucleophiles have also been shown to be suitable nucleophiles in this reaction. Dearomatising cyclisations of neutral nucleophiles can occur if the pyridine is first activated by a powerful electrophile (EX). 1,4-Dihydropyridines are generated upon spirocyclisation of N-vinylisonicotinamides. This thesis begins with routes towards enamides used as cyclisation precursors in this dearomatising spirocyclisation. It will go on to discuss the suitability of various electrophilic activation reagents in this reaction as well as the nature of the enamide, and the importance of the base. The optimised conditions for the hydrogenation of dihydropyridines to give stable, pharmaceutically-interesting piperidines and deprotections of the electrophilic activating reagents will also be discussed. Spirocyclisations of sterically encumbered chloropyridines and quinolines will also be included in this section.Dearomatising cyclisations of N-vinylnicotinamides and N-vinylpicolinamides will also be investigated. This section will contain routes to synthetically challenging N-vinylpicolinamides as well as quinoline-2-amides. The regioselectivity of additions to activated N-activated nicotinamides as well as attempted methods of achieving high regioselectivities in these reactions will be discussed.Finally, the feasibility of performing dearomatising cyclisation chemistry on other N-containing heterocycles such as pyrimidine and pyrazinecarboxamides will be investigated.

Defining potential to benefit from implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy: the role of biomarkers.
AIMS: Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy improves survival in patients at high sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk. However, some patient groups fulfilling indications for ICD therapy may not gain significant benefit: patients whose absolute risk of SCD is low and patients whose risk of death even with an ICD is high. The value of biomarkers in identifying patients' potential for survival benefit from ICD therapy is unknown. We performed a pilot study to investigate this. METHODS AND RESULTS: Five established cardiovascular biomarkers were measured in patients with ICDs on the background of left ventricular dysfunction: N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide NT-proBNP, soluble ST2 sST2, growth differentiation factor-15, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6. The endpoints were all-cause mortality and survival with appropriate ICD therapy. One hundred and fifty-six patients were enrolled (age 69 years Q1-Q3 62-77, 85% male, 76% ischaemic aetiology). During a follow-up of 15 ± 3 months, 12 patients died and 43 survived with appropriate ICD therapy. In a Cox proportional hazards model, the strongest predictors of death were Log sST2 (P< 0.001), serum creatinine (P< 0.001), and Log NT-proBNP (P= 0.002). The strongest predictor of survival with appropriate ICD therapy was Log NT-proBNP (P= 0.01). CONCLUSION: The biomarkers NT-proBNP and sST2 are promising biomarkers for identifying patients with little potential to gain significant survival benefit from ICD therapy. However, their incremental benefit, in addition to currently available clinical risk prediction models, remains unclear. These results demand a confirmatory prospective cohort study, designed and powered to derive and validate prediction algorithms incorporating these markers.

InterSCOPE study: Associations between esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and human papillomavirus serological markers.
BACKGROUND: The role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in the causation of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is unclear. We examined the associations between esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and 28 centrally measured HPV serological markers in serum from six existing case-control studies conducted in regions with differing background risks of esophageal cancer. METHODS: We used centralized multiplex serology to test serum samples from 1561 case subjects and 2502 control subjects from six case-control studies for antibodies to the major HPV capsid protein (L1) and/or the early proteins E6 and/or E7 of eight high-risk, two low-risk, and four cutaneous HPV types. Study-specific odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using conditional logistic regression with adjustment for smoking, alcohol consumption, and other potential confounders. Pooled odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using either a linear mixed-effects approach or a joint fixed-effects approach. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: We found statistically significant associations between esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and antibodies to E6 for HPV16 (OR = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.09 to 3.29, P = .023) and HPV6 (OR = 2.53, 95% CI = 1.51 to 4.25, P < .001) but not for other tested HPV types. There were no statistically significant associations between esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and antibodies to E7 for any of the tested HPV types. Simultaneous seropositivity for HPV16 E6 and E7 was rare (four case subjects, two control subjects; OR = 5.57, 95% CI = 0.90 to 34.35; P = .064). We also found statistically significant associations between esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and capsid antibodies for the high-risk mucosal type HPV33 L1 (OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.00 to 1.69; P = .047) and the low-risk mucosal types HPV6 (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.42; P = .010) and HPV11 (OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.09 to 1.56, P = .0036). CONCLUSIONS: We found limited serological evidence of an association between esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and HPV in the populations studied. Although HPV does not appear to be an important risk factor for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, we cannot exclude the possibility that certain HPV types may be involved in a small subset of cancers.

Fabrication of 3-dimensional cellular constructs via microstereolithography using a simple, three-component, poly(ethylene glycol) acrylate-based system.
A novel method for the production of inhibitor- and solvent-free resins suitable for three-dimensional (3D) microstereolithography is reported. Using an exemplar poly(ethylene glycol)-based resin, the control of features in the X, Y, and Z planes is demonstrated such that complex structures can be manufactured. Human mesenchymal stem cells cultured on the manufactured scaffolds remained viable during the 7 day assessment period, with proliferation rates comparable to those observed on tissue culture polystyrene. These data suggest that this novel, yet simple, method is suitable for the production of 3D scaffolds for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications.

Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist delivered directly and by gene therapy inhibits matrix degradation in the intact degenerate human intervertebral disc: an in situ zymographic and gene therapy study.
Data implicate IL-1 in the altered matrix biology that characterizes human intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. In the current study we investigated the enzymic mechanism by which IL-1 induces matrix degradation in degeneration of the human IVD, and whether the IL-1 inhibitor IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) will inhibit degradation. A combination of in situ zymography (ISZ) and immunohistochemistry was used to examine the effects of IL-1 and IL-1Ra on matrix degradation and metal-dependent protease (MDP) expression in explants of non-degenerate and degenerate human IVDs. ISZ employed three substrates (gelatin, collagen, casein) and different challenges (IL-1beta, IL-1Ra and enzyme inhibitors). Immunohistochemistry was undertaken for MDPs. In addition, IL-1Ra was introduced into degenerate IVD explants using genetically engineered constructs. The novel findings from this study are: IL-1Ra delivered directly onto explants of degenerate IVDs eliminates matrix degradation as assessed by multi-substrate ISZ; there is a direct relationship between matrix degradation assessed by ISZ and MDP expression defined by immunohistochemistry; single injections of IVD cells engineered to over-express IL-1Ra significantly inhibit MDP expression for two weeks. Our findings show that IL-1 is a key cytokine driving matrix degradation in the degenerate IVD. Furthermore, IL-1Ra delivered directly or by gene therapy inhibits IVD matrix degradation. IL-1Ra could be used therapeutically to inhibit degeneration of the IVD.

LPS INDUCED AND AGE RELATED NEUTROPHILIC INFLAMMATION IN ASTHMA
BACKGROUND: Asthma is a multidimensional syndrome made up of a range of ‘phenotypes’. Neutrophilic inflammation is one of these phenotypes. Neutrophilic asthma is linked to increased asthma severity, an increased likelihood of exacerbating and a reduced response to therapy.AIMS: The aim of this project was to investigate the pathogenesis, reproducibility and consequences of neutrophilic inflammation in asthma. The following were investigated: (1) the effect of onset age of asthma on sputum neutrophil counts (2) the reproducibility and validity of sputum neutrophil counts in moderate to severe asthmatics (3) the possible effect of LPS challenge in causing airway neutrophilia in moderate asthmatics, CXCL8 release from alveolar macrophages and possible corticosteroid resistant neutrophil chemotaxis.METHODS: (1) Clinical and inflammatory data of 19 early onset asthmatics and 19 late onset asthmatics were compared (2) The reproducibility of sputum neutrophils over the long (>2 months) and short term (7±1 days) was investigated in 14 moderate to severe asthmatics (3) Inhaled LPS was administered to 7 moderate asthmatics: Serial clinical measurements were taken to observe the safety of LPS inhalation. Sputum (n=7) and BAL samples (n=7) were analysed to observe the effects of LPS inhalation on the central and peripheral airways. Alveolar macrophages were obtained during bronchoscopy and cultured ex vivo (n=4).RESULTS: (1) There were increased neutrophil counts in LOA asthmatics compared to those with EOA. LOA subjects had better asthma control representative of increased lung function and reduced ACQ scores (2) sputum neutrophil counts suggested good reproducible value over both long and short term time periods. 90% power calculations were performed for parallel and cross over studies (3) Significant decreases in lung function were observed at 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 hours post LPS, significant increases in temperature post 6 and 8 hours and an observable increase in exhaled nitric oxide levels. There was no associated changes in steroid sensitivity pre and post LPS. Reduced CXCL8 and TNF release was observable (but not statistically significant) post ex vivo LPS stimulation.CONCLUSIONS: (1) Duration of asthma rather than age of onset of asthma is a key predictor of lung function. Raised sputum neutrophil counts are phenotypic to LOA but they do not indicate it as a biomarker of severe disease as previously described. (2) Sputum neutrophils are a repeatable and reliable endpoint, with good long and short term repeatability. Sputum monitoring during treatment steps could prove more effective based on downstream suppression (3) LPS inhalation has been shown to be a safe inducer of neutrophilic inflammation. No reported changes in steroid response were observed following LPS induced neutrophilia. Alveolar macrophage derived CXCL8 and TNF are tolerant cytokines following ex vivo LPS stimulation.

The role of inflammation, the autonomic nervous system and classical cardiovascular disease risk factors on subendocardial viability ratio in patients with RA: a cross-sectional and longitudinal study.
ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: There is evidence that rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients have increased susceptibility to myocardial ischemia which contributes to myocardial infarction. Sub-endocardial viability ratio (SEVR) can be measured using pulse wave analysis (PWA) and reflects myocardial oxygen supply and demand. The objective of the present study was to examine specific predictors of SEVR in RA patients, with a specific focus on inflammation and classical cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. METHODS: Two patient cohorts were included into the study; a primary cohort consisting of 220 RA patients and a validation cohort of 127 RA patients. All patients underwent assessment of SEVR using PWA. 31 patients from the primary cohort who were about to start anti-inflammatory treatment were prospectively examined for SEVR at pre-treatment baseline, 2 weeks, 3 months and 1 year following treatment. Systemic markers of disease activity and classical CVD risk factors were assessed in all patients. RESULTS: The SEVR (mean +/- standard deviation) for RA in the primary cohort was 148 +/- 27 and 142 +/- 25 in the validation cohort. Regression analyses revealed that all parameters of RA disease activity were associated with SEVR, along with gender, blood pressure and heart rate. These findings were the same in the validation cohort. Analysis of longitudinal data showed that C-reactive protein (CRP) (p<0.001), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p<0.005), disease activity score in 28 joints (p<0.001), mean blood pressure (p<0.005) and augmentation index (AIx) (p<0.001) were significantly reduced after commencing anti-TNFalpha treatment. Increasing CRP was found to be associated with a reduction in SEVR (p=0.02), and increase in AIx (p=0.001). CONCLUSION: The present findings revealed that SEVR is associated with markers of disease activity as well as highly prevalent classical CVD risk factors in RA such as high blood pressure and diabetes. Further prospective studies are required to determine whether SEVR predicts future cardiac events in RA.

C. elegans Model Identifies Genetic Modifiers of α-Synuclein Inclusion Formation During Aging
Inclusions in the brain containing ??-synuclein are the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease, but how these inclusions are formed and how this links to disease is poorly understood. We have developed a C. elegans model that makes it possible to monitor, in living animals, the formation of ??-synuclein inclusions. In worms of old age, inclusions contain aggregated ??-synuclein, resembling a critical pathological feature. We used genome-wide RNA interference to identify processes involved in inclusion formation, and identified 80 genes that, when knocked down, resulted in a premature increase in the number of inclusions. Quality control and vesicle-trafficking genes expressed in the ER/Golgi complex and vesicular compartments were overrepresented, indicating a specific role for these processes in ??-synuclein inclusion formation. Suppressors include aging-associated genes, such as sir-2.1/SIRT1 and lagr-1/LASS2. Altogether, our data suggest a link between ??-synuclein inclusion formation and cellular aging, likely through an endomembrane-related mechanism. The processes and genes identified here present a framework for further study of the disease mechanism and provide candidate susceptibility genes and drug targets for Parkinson's disease and other ??-synuclein related disorders.?? 2008 van Ham et al.

Two directional Pummerer cyclisations in a synthesis of dihydropyrroloindoledione based monomers for organic polymer photovoltaic devices
There is a great demand for organic photovoltaic devices in harvesting solar energy to address the energy crisis.  One recently discovered class of co-polymer of π-conjugated organic polymer which shows great promise is the diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and benzaodipyrrolidone (BDP). This report describes a two-directional synthesis of the novel dihydropyrroloindoledione (DPIP) monomers, which are structurally related to DPP and BDP.  Work has focussed on the development of a two-directional approach to the monomers utilising a Pummerer-type cyclisation previously developed in the group.. Two DPIP-based polymers were synthesised using the monomers prepared during the project and their optical and electronic properties are also presented. Finally, work towards the synthesis of a new BDP monomer was initiated.

Evidence of Preorganization in Quinonoid Intermediate Formation from l-Trp in H463F Mutant Escherichia coli Tryptophan Indole-lyase from Effects of Pressure and pH.
The effects of pH and hydrostatic pressure on the reaction of H463F tryptophan indole-lyase (TIL) have been evaluated. The mutant TIL shows very low activity for elimination of indole but is still competent to form a quinonoid intermediate from l-tryptophan Phillips, R. S., Johnson, N., and Kamath, A. V. (2002) Biochemistry 41, 4012-4019. Stopped-flow measurements show that the formation of the quinonoid intermediate at 505 nm is affected by pH, with a bell-shaped dependence for the forward rate constant, k(f), and dependence on a single basic group for the reverse rate constant, k(r), with the following values: pK(a1) = 8.14 ± 0.15, pK(a2) = 7.54 ± 0.15, k(f,min) = 18.1 ± 1.3 s(-1), k(f,max) = 179 ± 46.3 s(-1), k(r,min) = 11.4 ± 1.2 s(-1), and k(r,max) = 33 ± 1.6 s(-1). The pH effects may be due to ionization of Tyr74 as the base and Cys298 as the acid influencing the rate constant for deprotonation. High-pressure stopped-flow measurements were performed at pH 8, which is the optimum for the forward reaction. The rate constants show an increase with pressure up to 100 MPa and a subsequent decrease above 100 MPa. Fitting the pressure data gives the following values: k(f,0) = 15.4 ± 0.8 s(-1), ΔV(⧧) = -29.4 ± 2.9 cm(3) mol(-1), and Δβ(⧧) = -0.23 ± 0.03 cm(3) mol(-1) MPa(-1) for the forward reaction, and k(r,0) = 20.7 ± 0.8 s(-1), ΔV(⧧) = -9.6 ± 2.3 cm(3) mol(-1), and Δβ(⧧) = -0.05 ± 0.02 cm(3) mol(-1) MPa(-1) for the reverse reaction. The primary kinetic isotope effect on quinonoid intermediate formation at pH 8 is small (∼2) and is not significantly pressure-dependent, suggesting that the effect of pressure on k(f) may be due to perturbation of an active site preorganization step. The negative activation volume is also consistent with preorganization of the ES complex prior to quinonoid intermediate formation, and the negative compressibility may be due to the effect of pressure on the enzyme conformation. These results support the conclusion that the preorganization of the H463F TIL Trp complex, which is probably dominated by motion of the l-Trp indole moiety of the aldimine complex, contributes to quinonoid intermediate formation.

[cell, disease, locus, type, gene, study]

Integrating autoimmune risk loci with gene-expression data identifies specific pathogenic immune cell subsets.
Although genome-wide association studies have implicated many individual loci in complex diseases, identifying the exact causal alleles and the cell types within which they act remains greatly challenging. To ultimately understand disease mechanism, researchers must carefully conceive functional studies in relevant pathogenic cell types to demonstrate the cellular impact of disease-associated genetic variants. This challenge is highlighted in autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, where any of a broad range of immunological cell types might potentially be impacted by genetic variation to cause disease. To this end, we developed a statistical approach to identify potentially pathogenic cell types in autoimmune diseases by using a gene-expression data set of 223 murine-sorted immune cells from the Immunological Genome Consortium. We found enrichment of transitional B cell genes in systemic lupus erythematosus (p = 5.9 × 10(-6)) and epithelial-associated stimulated dendritic cell genes in Crohn disease (p = 1.6 × 10(-5)). Finally, we demonstrated enrichment of CD4+ effector memory T cell genes within rheumatoid arthritis loci (p < 10(-6)). To further validate the role of CD4+ effector memory T cells within rheumatoid arthritis, we identified 436 loci that were not yet known to be associated with the disease but that had a statistically suggestive association in a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis (p(GWAS) < 0.001). Even among these putative loci, we noted a significant enrichment for genes specifically expressed in CD4+ effector memory T cells (p = 1.25 × 10(-4)). These cell types are primary candidates for future functional studies to reveal the role of risk alleles in autoimmunity. Our approach has application in other phenotypes, outside of autoimmunity, where many loci have been discovered and high-quality cell-type-specific gene expression is available.

Reactivity of Chemical Respiratory Allergens in the Peroxidase Peptide Reactivity Assay.
Sensitizing chemicals are commonly associated primarily with either skin or respiratory sensitization. In the Direct Peptide Reactivity Assay (DPRA), when compared with skin sensitizers, respiratory allergens have been demonstrated to selectively react with lysine rather than cysteine. The Peroxidase Peptide Reactivity Assay (PPRA) has been developed as a refinement to the DPRA. The PPRA incorporates dose-response analyses, mass spectroscopy for peptide detection and a horseradish peroxidase-hydrogen peroxide enzymatic system, increasing the potential to identify pro-haptens. In the investigations reported here, the PPRA was evaluated to determine whether it provides advantages for the identification of respiratory allergens. Twenty respiratory sensitizers, including five predicted to be pre-/pro-haptens were evaluated. The PPRA performed similarly to the DPRA with respect to indentifying inherently reactive respiratory sensitizers. However, three respiratory sensitizers predicted to be pre-/pro-haptens (chlorhexidine, ethylenediamine and piperazine) were non-reactive and the general selectivity of the respiratory allergens for lysine was lost in the PPRA. Overall, the data indicate that the PPRA does not provide an advantage over the DPRA for discriminating allergens as either contact or respiratory sensitizers. Nevertheless, the PPRA provides a number of refinements to the DPRA that allow for an enhanced characterization of reactivity for both classes of chemical allergens.

Atrial Fibrillation in Heart Failure: An innocent bystander?
Heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) frequently coexist and each complicates the course of the other. The purpose of this review is to analyse the prognostic impact of AF in patients with HF and assess whether there is an advantage in targeting therapies towards the maintenance of sinus rhythm (SR) in this cohort of patients. The presence of AF in patients with HF has been reported to be independently associated with an increase in mortality in many studies and this increased risk is observed in those with both preserved and impaired LV systolic function. The optimal strategy for targeting AF in patients with HF is unclear but recent randomised controlled studies indicate no significant prognostic advantage associated with a rhythm control strategy as compared to a rate control strategy. A number of small studies have investigated the role of both cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) and AF catheter ablation for the maintenance of / conversion to SR in patients with HF with initial promising results although larger randomised controlled studies will need to be performed to define the role of these modalities in the treatment of this cohort and whether preliminary benefits observed in these studies translate to improvements in longer term prognosis. Finally, there has been a focus on modifying the arrythmogenic atrial substrate and neurohormonal milieu by pharmacological means in order to prevent AF although it remains to be seen whether this approach proves to be efficacious with improvements in clinically relevant outcomes.

The dependence of the radiation damage formation on the substrate implant temperature in GaN during Mg ion implantation
<p>In pursuit of p-type doping, we have implanted GaN with Mg ions at 200 and 500 keV with the substrate temperature maintained at -150 (cold) or +300 degrees C (hot) during ion irradiation. The samples have been annealed at 1000 degrees C postion implantation. The radiation damage peak position (and its profile), the dopant distribution, and the damage stability during annealing were all shown to be dependent upon the GaN substrate temperature during implantation. The damage peak position in the solid was reduced for cold implantation. The dopant distribution in the solid depends upon the implant temperature and in agreement with the damage measurements, the Mg range is shallower in GaN for cold implants when compared to hot implants. The trends observed suggest that the dynamic defect annealing fate during irradiation is reduced for cold implantation, and the subsequent increase in the damage level (scattering centers) formed during the damage buildup reduces the ion range in the solid. In turn, the reduced ion range subsequently limits the final damage range. The rate of damage removal during thermal annealing in the samples implanted at cold temperature was increased: this is explained by the greater complexity of defects caused during high-temperature implantation, due to the raised level of dynamic defect annealing.</p>

Resistance of brain glucose metabolism to thiopental-induced CNS depression in newborn piglets.
The transition from mild sedation to deep anaesthesia is marked by the phenomenon of burst suppression (BS). FDG-PET studies show that the cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRglc) declines dramatically with onset of BS in the adult brain. Global CMRglc increases substantially in the post-natal period and achieves its maximum in preadolescence. However, the impact of post-natal brain development on the vulnerability of CMRglc to the onset of BS has not been documented. Therefore, cerebral blood flow and metabolism were measured using a variant of the Kety-Schmidt method, in conjunction with quantitative regional estimation of brain glucose uptake by FDG-PET in groups of neonate and juvenile pigs, under a condition of light sedation or after induction of deep anaesthesia with thiopental. Quantification of simultaneous ECoG recordings was used to establish the correlation between anaesthesia-related changes in brain electrical activity and the observed cerebrometabolic changes. In the condition of light sedation the magnitude of CMRglc was approximately 20% higher in the older pigs, with the greatest developmental increase evident in the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia (P<0.05). Onset of BS was associated with 20-40% declines in CMRglc. Subtraction of the mean parametric maps for CMRglc showed the absolute reductions in CMRglc evoked by thiopental anaesthesia to be two-fold greater in the pre-adolescent pigs than in the neonates (P<0.05). Thus, the lesser suppression of brain energy demand of neonate brain during deep anaesthesia represents a reduced part of thiopental suppressing brain metabolism in neonates.

[il-17, cell, dendritic, schistosome, bacterial, infection, schistosome-specific, stimulation, induction]

Concurrent bacterial stimulation alters the function of helminth-activated dendritic cells, resulting in IL-17 induction.
Infection with schistosome helminths is associated with granulomatous inflammation that forms around parasite eggs trapped in host tissues. In severe cases, the resulting fibrosis can lead to organ failure, portal hypertension, and fatal bleeding. Murine studies identified IL-17 as a critical mediator of this immunopathology, and mouse strains that produce high levels of IL-17 in response to schistosome infection show increased mortality. In this article, we demonstrate that schistosome-specific IL-17 induction by dendritic cells from low-pathology C57BL/6 mice is normally regulated by their concomitant induction of IL-10. Simultaneous stimulation of schistosome-exposed C57BL/6 dendritic cells with a heat-killed bacterium enabled these cells to overcome IL-10 regulation and induce IL-17, even in wild-type C57BL/6 recipients. This schistosome-specific IL-17 was dependent on IL-6 production by the copulsed dendritic cells. Coimmunization of C57BL/6 animals with bacterial and schistosome Ags also resulted in schistosome-specific IL-17, and this response was enhanced in the absence of IL-10-mediated immune regulation. Together, our data suggest that the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines that determines the severity of pathology during schistosome infection can be influenced not only by host and parasite, but also by concurrent bacterial stimulation.

The effects of the cardiac myosin activator, omecamtiv mecarbil, on cardiac function in systolic heart failure: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, dose-ranging phase 2 trial.
BACKGROUND: Many patients with heart failure remain symptomatic and have a poor prognosis despite existing treatments. Decreases in myocardial contractility and shortening of ventricular systole are characteristic of systolic heart failure and might be improved by a new therapeutic class, cardiac myosin activators. We report the first study of the cardiac myosin activator, omecamtiv mecarbil, in patients with systolic heart failure. METHODS: We undertook a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial investigating the effects of omecamtiv mecarbil (formerly CK-1827452), given intravenously for 2, 24, or 72 h to patients with stable heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction receiving guideline-indicated treatment. Clinical assessment (including vital signs, echocardiograms, and electrocardiographs) and testing of plasma drug concentrations took place during and after completion of each infusion. The primary aim was to assess safety and tolerability of omecamtiv mecarbil. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00624442. FINDINGS: 45 patients received 151 infusions of active drug or placebo. Placebo-corrected, concentration-dependent increases in left ventricular ejection time (up to an 80 ms increase from baseline) and stroke volume (up to 9·7 mL) were recorded, associated with a small reduction in heart rate (up to 2·7 beats per min; p<0·0001 for all three measures). Higher plasma concentrations were also associated with reductions in end-systolic (decrease of 15 mL at >500 ng/mL, p=0·0026) and end-diastolic volumes (16 mL, p=0·0096) that might have been more pronounced with increased duration of infusion. Cardiac ischaemia emerged at high plasma concentrations (two patients, plasma concentrations roughly 1750 ng/mL and 1350 ng/mL). For patients tolerant of all study drug infusions, no consistent pattern of adverse events with either dose or duration emerged. INTERPRETATION: Omecamtiv mecarbil improved cardiac function in patients with heart failure caused by left ventricular dysfunction and could be the first in class of a new therapeutic agent.

{AA2099-T8} aluminium alloy was anodized at a current density of 5 {mA/cm} 2 to selected voltages in 0.1 M ammonium pentaborate electrolyte at 293 K. It was found that the growth of barrier-type anodic film on the alloy was accompanied by oxidation of intermetallics, formation and rupture of oxygen gas-filled voids in the anodic film and healing of the anodic film at the sites of rupture. It was revealed that the formation of oxygen gas-filled voids was related to the oxidation of copper-rich nanoparticles in the copper-enriched layer at the film/alloy interface, and that the oxidation process of copper-rich nanoparticles depended on grain orientation. Further, the significantly reduced Pilling-Bedworth ratio for formation of anodic lithium oxide compared with that for formation of anodic alumina resulted in the formation of fine voids at the alloy/film interface and sequentially, detachment of the anodic film from the alloy surface. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Negotiating Progress: Promoting 'modern' physics in Britain, 1900-1940
The first four decades of the twentieth century was a period of rapid development in physics. The late nineteenth century discoveries of X-rays, Becquerel rays and subatomic particles had revealed new properties of matter, and the early twentieth century quantum and relativity theories added to the notion that the discipline was undergoing a fundamental change in thought and practice. Historians and scientists alike have retrospectively conceived of a sharp divide between nineteenth century and twentieth century physics, applying the terms ‘classical’ and ‘modern’ to distinguish between these two practices.However, recent scholarship has suggested that early twentieth century physicists did not see this divide as self-evident, and in fact were responsible for consciously constructing these categories and definitions. This thesis explores the creation of the terms ‘classical’ and ‘modern’ physics in Britain, and the physicists responsible. I consider how these terms were employed in ‘public’ arenas (lectures, books, newspapers, museums) influencing the wider reception of ‘modern’ physics. I consider not only the rhetorics employed by ‘modern’ physicists, but also those we would now consider to be ‘classical’, revealing a diverse range of potential definitions of ‘modern’ physics. Furthermore, even within the ‘modernists’ themselves, there was considerable disagreement over how their work was to be presented, as industrially applicable, or of value simply as intellectual knowledge in and of itself. There were also different notions of how scientific ‘progress’ should be portrayed, whether knowledge advanced through experimental refinement or theoretical work.Early twentieth century ‘modern’ physics appeared to discard long held theories, rejecting much of the discipline’s past. As such, physicists’ connection to the legacy of Newton was under threat. Furthermore, the instability of science more generally was revealed: if physicists had shown the old theories to be wrong, then why should the new ones be any different? This had severe implications as to how the public placed ‘trust’ in science. I explore how physicists carefully managed the ‘public’ transition from ‘classical’ to ‘modern’ physics, regaining public trust during a period of scientific ‘revolution’ and controversy.

Household chemicals, immune function, and allergy: A commentary.
In recent decades, in the US and in Western and Northern Europe, there has been a significant increase in the prevalence of atopic allergic disease. Although that increase may now be slowing, or have already reached a plateau, there remains considerable interest in the factor or factors that may have caused this increased susceptibility to allergy and asthma. Certainly, the changes recorded have been too rapid to implicate a change in the gene pool, and for that reason attention has focused on the possible impact of environmental, dietary, and lifestyle factors. Although the hygiene hypothesis proposes that increased susceptibility to allergic sensitization is associated with changes in childhood exposure pathogenic microorganisms, other factors have been considered also. Among these is exposure to chemicals and atmospheric pollutants. There is some evidence that exposure to certain chemicals may elicit or exacerbate respiratory reactions in those who are already sensitized, or who already have existing airway disease. However, a recent article has proposed that exposure to specific household cleaning products may be one factor that is able to affect susceptibility to allergic sensitization. In the light of that article it is timely now to consider again the ability of chemical exposure to influence sensitization to common antigens.

High prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome in patients attending urological outpatient departments.
Irritable bowel syndrome patients often complain of urinary symptoms such as frequency, urgency, and dysuria, raising the possibility of inappropriate referral to the urologist. To resolve this issue, the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome was compared in patients attending urological and control clinics (dermatology and ENT). The overall prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome was 31.2% in the urological clinic compared with 21.2% in the controls (P < 0.001), but striking, differences emerged, depending on presenting complaint. Irritable bowel symptoms were particularly common in patients presenting with loin pain (male: 40.9%, P = 0.004; female: 50%, P = 0.03), dysuria (male: 43.8%, P = 0.007; female: 46.2%, P = 0.01) and frequency/urgency (male: 31.7%, P = 0.002; female: 42.4%, P = 0.006), and the male/female prevalence was 24% and 44%. These results suggest that in irritable bowel syndrome, urinary symptoms including loin pain can present diagnostic dilemmas in both the gastroenterological and urological setting, underlining the importance of specialists in these fields working together in order to define better ways of managing such patients.

BSPAR ANNUAL CONFERENCE ABSTRACTS * 12. Use of non-etanercept biologics in children with JIA: results from the Biologics for Children with Rheumatic Diseases Study
Background: The introduction of biologic therapies has revolutionized the management of JIA. Previously, the only choice of licensed therapy in the UK was etanercept (ETN), with adalimumab (age >=4 years), abatacept (age >= 6 years) and tocilizumab (systemic arthritis) more recently included. 
Objective: The objective of this analysis was to describe non-ETN biologic pattern of use in children with JIA. 
Methods: The Biologics for Children with Rheumatic Diseases (BCRD) study is an ongoing prospective observational cohort study that has been collecting detailed information on children <18 years of age starting a non-ETN biologic therapy for JIA since 2010. Detailed demographic and disease information, including past biologic therapies, are collected at baseline. Using non-parametric descriptive statistics the use of non-ETN therapy as a first-line or subsequent biologic therapy was compared, including patterns of prescription, use under licensed indications, ILAR subtypes and disease activity/severity. 
Results: To 08/16/2012, 148 children across the UK were recruited: median age 10 years, 64% female. The most common ILAR subtypes were systemic arthritis (30%) and RF-negative polyarthritis (26%). Seventy-one patients (48%) were starting a non-ETN biologic as firstline biologic therapy, of which 35 (49%) were prescribed off-licence, largely accounted for by infliximab and anakinra. First-line biologic users were a younger cohort compared with subsequent biologic users (P=0.0077). All patients on anakinra had systemic arthritis, whereas only 73% of tocilizumab patients used it for this licensed indication. Forty-five per cent of first-line users vs 25% of subsequent users had a history of chronic anterior uveitis (P=0.031). Of those registered at the point of starting a second-line biologic, 78% had received prior ETN. The majority of all patients receiving previous biologic treatment had received only one prior biologic (71%) although 18 children had received two prior biologics, 3 children had received three and 1 child (RF negative) had received five previous biologics. Subsequent biologic users had a higher limited joint count (P=0.0026). 
Conclusions: In the UK, many children are now receiving non-ETN biologics, although almost half of these are being prescribed off-licence. Continual follow-up in children with JIA will help to address questions of the best choice of biologic therapy, as both first-line and subsequent treatment, as well as determine the safety of these drugs in children, for which limited clinical experience exists.
