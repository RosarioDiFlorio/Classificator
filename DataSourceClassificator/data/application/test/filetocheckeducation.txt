A Study of Arizona's Teachers of English Language Learners
Part 1 of the Arizona Educational Equity Project. Overall findings show that most of these Arizona teachers have a great deal of faith in their ELL students' ability to achieve at grade level but that the 4 hour ELD block to which they are assigned is not helping them to catch up with their English speaking peers.

      Abstract:
      In this study a representative sample of 880 elementary and secondary teachers currently teaching in 33 schools across the state of Arizona were asked about their perceptions of how their ELL students were faring under current instructional policies for ELL students. Teachers were surveyed during the Spring of 2010. Overall findings show that most of these Arizona teachers have a great deal of faith in their ELL students' ability to achieve at grade level but that the 4 hour ELD block to which they are assigned is not helping them to catch up with their English speaking peers academically and there is deep and overwhelming concern about the segregation they are experiencing as a result of this instructional model; 85% believe this separation from English speaking peers is harmful to their learning. Most also believe that the majority of their ELL students are not meeting grade level standards and more than half of teachers also note that their ELL students are stereotyped as slow learners by other students and that the 4 hour block program is harmful to their self-esteem. The study ends with a series of recommendations including that alternative modes of instruction need to be implemented to help ELL students to succeed academically.

[assessment, teacher, science, expertise]

Unraveling the Complex: Changes in Secondary Science Preservice Teachers' Assessment Expertise
Becoming prepared to assess science learning is a daunting endeavor. Expert science teachers assess a wide range of scientific knowledge and practices, modify instruction based on assessment information, and consider the needs of their diverse learners. These skills are informed by but not necessarily consistent with what one believes and knows about assessment. In this study, I explored the ways in which the assessment expertise of 11 secondary science preservice teachers changed during their 12-month teacher education program. Conceptually, I framed assessment expertise along three dimensions: (a) constructing coherently linked assessments (Construction), (b) using assessment to support students' science learning (Use), and (c) equitably assessing English learners (Equity). Informed by the Construction-Use-Equity (CUE) framework, I designed a set of activities to support teacher learning about assessing science in linguistically diverse classrooms and delivered these activities in three of the participants' courses. Given this context, I report on both conceptual development and empirical findings from the study. First, via a scoring rubric, I articulate how the multidimensional CUE framework translates into observable levels of assessment expertise. Next, I report on the mixed methods analysis of surveys, interviews, and teacher products. Broadly, descriptive and non-parametric statistical analyses indicate that the teachers' assessment expertise changed differently among the three conceptual dimensions. Qualitative analyses describe the nature of these changes. Most notably, the teachers (a) considered the alignment between assessment task and learning objective, (b) expanded their repertoire of assessment tasks and general assessment strategies, (c) moved toward a formative view of assessment, and (d) became increasingly aware about the role of language in assessment. Finally, in greater detail, I explore the latter pattern by incorporating qualitative analysis of three teachers' classroom practices. These resulting case studies illustrate tensions about whether to assess language in addition to science content and whether to scaffold language use in assessment rather than reduce the use of language. By furthering a conceptualization of assessment expertise and by identifying and describing changing expertise, the study aims to inform how teachers are prepared to assess science.

The Relationship Between Parental Involvement and High School  Graduation Among Different Ethnicity Groups
<bold>Abstract:</bold> This study examines ethnic differences in the effects of multiple types of parental involvement (PI) on high school graduation. PI is theorized to include four distinct dimensions: parent-child communication, school involvement, home supervision, and aspiration. These four dimensions can be broken into a total of 10 sub-dimensions. Factor analysis is used to construct latent variables representing the sub-dimensions, which are subsequently included in a logistic regression model with graduating vs. not graduating as the outcomes.  The model is first run on the full sample of students and then on each of four ethnic groups to examine for ethnic differences in the effects. The results show that mean levels of PI differ across ethnic groups for all ten sub-dimensions. Of the ethnic groups, Asian parents tend to be least involved in discussions of schooling progress and in providing advice on schooling, while White parents help with homework least. Asian and Hispanic parents tend to contact the school and participate in school activities less than White or Black parents. Moreover, Black parents tend to set more rules, while Asian parents set limits and privileges based on children's performance most. The effect of PI on graduation also differs across ethnic groups.  Parent participation in school activities impacts graduation positively among all ethnic groups. Asian children benefit most from parents' participation in school activities and Black children benefit least from it. However, while most other PI dimensions are significantly associated with graduation for White students, which is not the case for ethnic minorities.

Cultural center staff : a grounded theory of distributed relational leadership and retention
Changing demographics and the widening educational achievement gap called for this examination of underserved university student retention (Castillo-Cullather & Stuart, 2002 ; Miller & Garcia, 2004 ; Singleton & Linton, 2006). University cultural centers promote retention and sense of belonging for underserved students (June, 1996; Patton, 2006; Welch, 2008).This study included Schlossberg's (1989) theory of mattering to investigate underserved student retention. Using constructivist grounded theory data analysis methods, this study examined the influences of sense of belonging and mattering on underserved student retention in a university cultural center (Charmaz, 2006). Qualitative data collection methods were implemented to analyze cultural center and cultural center staff influence on sense of belonging and mattering of underserved students. Seven undergraduate students and one full-time staff member in the Cross-Cultural Center at California State University, San Marcos, participated in focus groups and an interview. Document analysis contributed to the trustworthiness of the data (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). A theory grounded in the experiences of the students, student staff, and staff of the Cross-Cultural Center emerged from the data. The emerging theory was called "Cultural Center Staff : A Grounded Theory of Distributed Relational Leadership and Retention." Distributed relational leadership was the core or central phenomenon of the grounded theory. As a rich emergent finding, identity development was added to this study's conceptual framework of sense of belonging, mattering, and retention. Distributed relational leadership, sense of community, the physical space of the Center, and programs influenced the sense of belonging, mattering, identity development, and retention of underserved students. This study's grounded theory guides ongoing retention theory research and university cultural center practice

Free transit for low-income youth: Experience in the San Francisco Bay Area
In August 2002, AC Transit – the principal bus operator serving the eastern shore of the San Francisco Bay – began distributing free bus passes to low-income middle school and high school students in the transit service district. The program developed in response to grassroots community activism and growing political pressure to remove the burden of school transportation costs from low-income households. Advocates argued that school transportation costs were a barrier that prevented poor children from participating in after-school activities and, in severe cases, led to missed days of school. Funding for a pilot bus pass program was provided by the transit agency, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, local agencies, and several nonprofit organizations. The University of California, Berkeley, was funded to carry out an evaluation of the program during the first year of the program. Before-and-after travel and activity surveys, interviews, focus group meetings, and analysis of attendance data were used in the evaluation. Findings after 1 year of implementation indicate that the free bus pass program increased student bus ridership and after-school participation but did not increase overall school attendance. Increases in bus use were greater among pass holders, in areas with high levels of bus service, and among high school students.

Nurseries and emotional well-being.  Evaluating an emotionally containing model of professional development
Despite official endorsement of attachment principles in nursery work, these are often not translated into nursery practice. One possible reason for this is that staff training does not sufficiently address the personal implications and anxieties that children's attachments may entail for practitioners. Working from a psychoanalytic perspective on organisational functioning and group learning, this paper describes action research with a group of nursery heads who participated in a professional development programme designed specifically to explore emotional experience in professional work. The positive evaluations of the programme by heads and their staff are described including examples of experiential learning and of increased staff awareness about, and responsiveness to, the emotional experience of children. However, the research also concluded that sustained effectiveness of the model is likely to be dependent on an ongoing culture of attention to the emotional experience of nursery staff within nursery umbrella organisations.

Tilting Trains: The Italian ETR and the Swedish X-2000
This is one of a series of reports now being produced as the first output of our study of the potential for a high-speed passenger train service in California. Each report deals with a specific high-speed train technology; it attempts an evaluation, standardized as far as available data permit, of its technical and economic viability.
      Specifically, each report assesses the particular high-speed technology against a number of criteria:
      1. Technical Performance: configuration of roadbed in terms of gradients, curvature, and construction cost; power sources; capacity and speed; capacity to integrate with existing transportation facilities.
      2. Economic performance: traffic levels; revenues; financial appraisal and overall cost-benefit analysis; level of public subsidy required, if any.
      3. Resource consumption and environmental performance: type and amount of energy required; impact on non-renewable resources; environmental impact, including emissions, noise, visual intrusion and effect on local communities.
      The present series includes five studies. Two companion studies, on British Rail's InterCity 125 and 225 services and on Tilting Trains (the Italian Pendolino and the Swedish X-2000 service), will follow shortly. Thereafter, a systematic comparative analysis will be published.
      The CalSpeed study will continue with preliminary route alignments, also to be produced shortly, followed by market assessments, to be completed in Fall 1992. These will bring to a close the present phase of work, which will be the subject of an overall report also to be completed in Fall 1992.

The use of interactive learning technologies in elementary and middle school classrooms
Audience Response Systems (ARS) increase interactions and active engagement by providing the means for students to electronically respond to questions presented to them during class. ARS immediately aggregates data and teachers and students have access to real time formative assessments of student knowledge. A large body of research exists for ARS in higher education, which supports ARS as tool for increasing interactivity, engagement, and participation in large university lecture halls. A gap exists in research that explores ARS at the elementary and middle school levels. This study examined how ARS is used in elementary and middle school classrooms and focused on teachers' goals for using ARS, current classroom practices, and teachers' perceptions of how ARS effects student engagement. Activity theory provided a framework for examining the teaching and learning environment within the classroom setting. A principal component analysis revealed that teachers used ARS for two specific goals, to enhance teaching and learning, and to enhance assessment. Three types of ARS classroom use were found for teachers in K-8 classrooms. The first type of classroom use included strategies that promoted discussion and student thinking. The second type of use utilized ARS feedback to modify and adjust instruction. The third type of use capitalized on ARS feedback to monitor student understanding without assigning grades. Teachers perceived that students were more actively involved and engaged in their learning while using ARS. Future research should look at classroom uses and pedagogical practices that promote the greatest growth in academic learning

Expecting the Unexpected:  A Study of New Principal Experiences
Principals are instrumental in establishing effective schools and positive learning communities.  There is only one principal in every school and thus, the position clearly requires a knowledgeable, highly skilled, and well-prepared individual. Principal training programs provide generally effective instruction that seemingly prepares emerging leaders for the expectations and logistical demands of the principalship.  Yet the state of the profession is unstable.  The research on principals shows that fewer administrators are applying for the position, newly hired principals are younger and less experienced, and longevity is a problem. The position is synonymous with long hours, little appreciation, and high stressful situations.  Although principal preparation programs do address logistical problem solving, there is no curriculum for incoming principals that addresses the phenomenon of the unexpected event.  Surprise events are stressful, salient, disruptive, and can make or break a career.  A principal who is able to control an unexpected event, whether the event is caused by them or not, and foster an appropriate outcome likely feels strongly self-efficacious.  On the other hand, principals who are faced with unexpected events and handle their own role in a manner that leads to a negative outcome, likely develop low self-esteem, low feelings of efficacy, and are more likely to leave the position or be ineffective leaders.  This research project queried high and middle school principals from a moderate sized urban school district about whether they have experienced an unexpected event and if so, the details of that event were recorded.  Specifically, qualitative descriptions were collected to develop an understanding of the variety of events that could and do occur during a principal's career.  Using both quantitative and qualitative data collection, the research documented the principal's role, feelings, and self-reflections about the event. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the nature of unexpected events.  The project also sought to discover, in depth, the personal experiences of the principal and the views of the principals about the event and outcome, and most importantly, the feelings of the principals about their role in the event and their role in the outcome.  The investigation revealed several notable findings that linked event types and outcomes with principals' feelings.  In all, principals experienced significant unexpected events that had a high impact on all involved.  The principals mostly stated that they were unprepared yet most controlled their own emotions and behaviors well.  Theoretical frameworks were used to conceptualize the events and the emotional impact on the principals was characterized.  Further, principals were passionate about elucidating the concept of a surprise event as a component of principal training programs, as all felt that if they could expect these events on some level, their ability to handle them would have greatly improved. This important implication was discussed and further research suggested.

The supplemental instruction program : student perceptions of the learning environment and impact on student academic achievement in college science at California State University, San Marcos
Higher education in science has been criticized and calls to increase student learning and persistence to degree has been recognized as a national problem by the Department of Education, the National Science Foundation, the National Research Council, and the National Academy of Sciences. One mode of academic assistance that may directly address this issue is the implementation of Supplemental Instruction (SI) in science courses. SI is a specific model of academic assistance designed to help students in historically difficult science classes master course content, thus increasing their academic achievement and retention. This study assessed the SI program at California State University, San Marcos, in supported science courses. Specifically, academic achievement based on final course grades were compared between SI participating and nonparticipating students, multiple affective factors were measured at the beginning and end of the semester, and students' perceptions of the classroom and SI session learning environments recorded. Overall, students who attended five or more SI sessions achieved higher final course grades. Students who chose to participate in SI had higher initial levels of responsibility and anxiety. Additionally, SI participants experienced a reduction in anxiety over the semester whereas nonparticipants experienced an increase in anxiety from beginning to the end of the semester. The learning environment of SI embodies higher levels of constructivist principles of active learning such as cooperation, cohesiveness, innovation, and personalization -- with one exception for the physics course, which is a based on problem-based learning. Structural equation modeling of variables indicates that high self-efficacy at the end of the semester is directly related to high final course grades; this is mediated by cohesion in the classroom and the cooperation evidenced in SI sessions. These findings are elaborated by student descriptions of what happened in SI sessions and discussed given the theoretical frameworks of Bandura's concept of self-efficacy and learning environment activities that embody constructivist principles

Education in Disguise: Sanctioning Sexuality in Elementary School Halloween Celebrations
Given the pervasive silence that surrounds sexuality in elementary schools,Halloween provides a rare opportunity to explore its tangible manifestations. Schools sanction overt displays of sexuality and transgressions of certain school norms on this day. A time of celebration, it is perceived as a festive event for children, innocent and fun. Yet, because Halloween is the one school day where sexuality is on display, sexuality literally becomes a spectacle. Halloween serves as a magnifying glass to examine the operation of sexuality in the institution of elementary schools, illuminating a nexus of attendant relationships—social, economic, political, and cultural. These relationships lie buried beneath the veneer of fun and play that is popularly imagined as integral to the holiday. Drawing from ethnographic data collected over the 2010-2011 school year, I explore how processes of citizen creation through schooling are abetted by the U.S. consumer market, which strategically targets children, and girls in particular. This paper examines the ways in which elementary school Halloween celebrations bring to light the significance of sexuality in a culture that creates and exploits children’s desires.

Valuing Education: How Culture Influences the Participation of Mexican Immigrant Mothers in the Formal Education of their Children in the United States
U.S. Latino parents are often characterized by educators as uninvolved in school and the formal education of their children because they do not value education. While research indicates otherwise, stereotypes still exist among many educators that one reason Latinos do poorly in school is because they do not care. Masked behind stereotypes is the significant variation in levels of parent involvement in education among U.S. Latinos. The literature does not address why parents with similar socioeconomic, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds respond to schools in such distinct ways. This ethnographic case study addresses variation in the involvement of Mexican immigrant mothers by focusing on how some use their cultured capacities to construct strategies of action in the formal education of their children in the United States. The implications for policy and practice include a greater understanding of why some Mexican immigrant parents routinely participate in the school affairs of their children while others with similar characteristics and backgrounds do not; and how institutions, like schools, may have the means to impact the strategies of action chosen by parents through the use of widely disseminated semiotic codes. This study also finds that culture's role in the participation of Mexican immigrant parents could not fully be accounted for in Epstein's (1995, 2001) Six Types of Involvement for Parents. Socializing was identified as a seventh type of involvement that may actually serve as a catalyst for involvement in the other six types and a means for strengthening home-school connections. In addition, a significant finding not seen elsewhere in the literature was an overwhelming amount of evidence that the majority of Mexican immigrant mothers in this study believed that schools were better in Mexico than the U.S.

High School Reading Intervention in the Special Education Classroom
Providing reading intervention for adolescent students is a complicated process.  Multiple factors specific to high school settings affect the process, including: curriculum selection, designating a class period (core or elective), identifying students, allocating highly qualified teachers, and choosing effective strategies.  Confounding these variables is the influence of non-academic skills that are also frequently deficient for students with learning disabilities (LD) such as organization, independence, self-advocacy, and self-esteem. 	This study investigated practices for teaching reading to high school students with special needs through a Tier 3 core-replacement English-language Arts (ELA) program at 2 high schools and within the context of district planning. Qualitative methods were used, including observation, interview, and document review.  Although reading intervention is defined legally in terms of NCLB (2002) and IDEA (2004), what is meant by "reading intervention" in schools and classrooms is continually made and remade by participants. Special education practitioners negotiate, prioritize, and adapt practices with a sometimes startling rapidity that is tied to the influence of IDEA and NCLB, and also local factors, including district and school policies, understanding of their role, and student-teacher interactions.  	ABC and XYZ High Schools were located in Mission School District in southern California.  Mission employed an RTI model to provide reading intervention (Fuchs et al., 2007).  Reading difficulties are a substantial concern for older students and there is not a strong a literature base for this population (Denton et al., 2008) or about Tier 3 interventions (Vaughn et al., 2011). 	Mission purchased a scripted program for use in high school special education classrooms.  Results indicated that there was great variety in how special education teachers defined their many roles and how they allocated class time for: 1) use of the scripted curriculum, 2) preparation for high stakes tests, and 3) addressing IEP goals.  Teachers in the study tended to adapt the program to fit their classroom practices rather than changing their teaching behaviors to align to the script.  Implications for school districts include problems associated with lack of fidelity of program implementation in pubic school settings.  Even with fidelity procedures in place, teachers' buy-in to the program and their own prioritizing of the roles of special education teachers strongly influenced how classes were conducted.

Remediation as a Civil Rights Issue in the California State University System
From the foreward by Gary Orfield:
      As we face the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, college opportunity has been negatively impacted by drastic cuts and the rising cost of education. In California specifically, higher education opportunity seems to be nearly out of reach for low-income students, academically unprepared students, and students of color. Historically, higher education has been considered a mechanism of upward mobility. Considered part of the “American Dream,” parents encourage their children to strive for this goal, even if parents themselves never attended college.Academically underprepared students, or this lacking the basic skills of math ad/or English to be at college-level, represent over half of entering freshmen at the CSU. What these startling numbers really represent is a growing number of underprepared students graduating California high schools, often with excellent grades, yet being denied admission of the state’s public institutions. Despite California’s commitment to universal access to all who can benefit and tuition-free education, what we are seeing is an inability to uphold this social contract at the cost of student’s futures.The negative impact of budget cuts has been felt beyond the students and their families. Recent pay cuts, furloughs, and other declines in financial support have also impacted faculty and staff at the CSU campuses. Increasingly, faculty and staff have feelings of unfairness, as they struggle to provide services and quality education to students, yet experience enormous cut after cut. Morale continues to plummet as faculty and staff are expected to perform the duties of educating the stat’s youth, ye the value of education seems practically non-existent within the state’s budget priorities.

Elementary physical education programs : in what ways might leaders best facilitate positive change?
The overwhelming evidence that supports coupling a healthy diet with proper exercise suggests that schools can help target the growing epidemic of childhood obesity through physical education instruction. However, because of pressure to perform well on standardized testing, a lack of funding, and limited time in the school day, physical education often does not get the attention it needs. This mixed-methods study explored the perceptions of superintendents, principals, and teachers in the area of physical education instruction. Data collected offered insight into current program quality at the time of the study, as well as ideas as to what might make physical education stronger. The results suggested that superintendents felt time, budget constraints, a lack of desired personnel, and accountability pressures in the core academic areas affected their abilities to sufficiently oversee physical education programs. Principals stated the lack of accountability by the state and district, funding, and the absence of professional development negatively affected physical education. Finally, teachers, despite having a personal connection to the subject and feeling confident they can deliver high quality instruction, stated a lack of equipment, standardized test pressure, limited time, and a lack of ongoing professional development stood in their way of providing high quality physical education instruction

A Categorification of Hall Algebras
In recent years, there has been great interest in the study of categorification, specifically as it applies to the theory of quantum groups. In this thesis, we would like to provide a new approach to this problem by looking at Hall algebras. It is know, due to Ringel, that a Hall algebra is isomorphic to a certain quantum group. It is our goal to describe a categorification of Hall algebras as a way of doing so for their related quantum groups. To do this, we will take the following steps. First, we describe a new perspective on the structure theory of Hall algebras. This view solves, in a unique way, the classic problem of the multiplication and comultiplication not being compatible. Our solution is to switch to a different underlying category Vect^K of vector spaces graded by a group K called the Grothendieck group. We equip this category with a nontrivial braiding which depends on the K-grading. With this braiding and a given antipode, we find that the Hall algebra does become a Hopf algebra object in Vect^K. Second, we will describe a categorification process, call `groupoidification', which replaces vector spaces with groupoids and linear operators with `spans' of groupoids. We will use this process to construct a braided monoidal bicategory which categorifies Vect^K via the groupoidification program. Specifically, graded vector spaces will be replaced with groupoids `over' a fixed groupoid related to the Grothendieck group K. The braiding structure will come from an interesting groupoid EXT(M,N) which will behave like the Euler characteristic for the Grothendieck group K.

Collective Impact: A Case Study in Collaboration at a Teacher-Developed School
This study explored collaboration at a teacher-developed and implemented small high school that was a product of a district's comprehensive school reform initiative. This initiative was aimed at improving outcomes for youth in communities where chronic school failure had become entrenched. Specifically, this study investigated how the phenomenon of teacher collaboration both catalyzes and fosters teachers' sense of shared responsibility for student success and well being, their perceptions of collective efficacy, and their trust in colleagues to both internalize and implement the school's mission. I used a single-case study as the mode of inquiry in order to create a detailed portrait of teacher collaboration based on how teachers both talk about and implement their work. I drew from five principle information sources: (a) all 19 faculty members completed three surveys aimed at understanding teachers' perceptions of collective efficacy, faculty trust, and shared responsibility; (b) I conducted 16, hour-long interviews to understand collaborative practices relative to trust, collective efficacy, and shared responsibility; (c) I conducted one focus group that focused on the nature of collaboration at the site; (d) I observed four collaborative teacher meetings; and (e) five teachers wrote twice-weekly reflections on their collaborative practices. I conclude this study with recommendations for teacher-led school transformation as one approach to turning around failing schools.

Faculty funds of knowledge : sources of knowledge for teaching in community college faculty
This study takes a socio-cultural theoretical approach to better understanding the career pathways to full-time teaching at the community college. Building on Shulman's (1987) conceptual model of teacher knowledge, this case study explores the formal and practical life experiences that have contributed to the faculty funds of knowledge that have shaped the teaching practice of Arts and Humanities, Behavioral Sciences, and Natural Sciences and Mathematics faculty at a single community college. A survey of 60 academic, full-time faculty and interviews with a subset of 15 of these faculty formed the basis for the data collected. The faculty interviewed reflected a range of disciplinary expertise, teaching experience and ethnicity. The study reveals that there was not one common pathway to becoming a community college professor. Moreover, the pathways differed along social and developmental dimensions; they were characterized by both private and career transitions that occurred throughout the faculty's lifetimes. Although formal experiences contributed to faculty knowledge for teaching, less formal, more pragmatic experiences had a greater influence on practice. The experiential knowledge that faculty accumulated over time influenced their general pedagogical skills and understanding of the context of the community college and the characteristics of its diverse student population. Life experience was also shown to contribute to the pedagogical content knowledge of faculty and their ability to make course content accessible and relevant to their students. Also discussed are the implications for further research, policy, and practice involving the role of life experience in the development of the knowledge for teaching in community college faculty

An examination of professional learning in two districts : comparing the quality and quantity of network structure for improved achievement
A growing body of literature on system-wide reform has shown districts, more than individual schools alone, are able to serve as a catalyst for closing the achievement gap and increase student achievement (McLaughlin & Talbert, 2003). Researchers on reform initiatives have focused more on centralization. What is less understood, are the interworking of how districts and schools work together to successfully implement new reform initiatives. More recent research on districts and schools has used the lenses of district-school relationships and social network theory as a way to analyze the formal and informal relationship structure of school districts. The idea is if people are collaborating then there will be more of a chance for the creation of social capital or new knowledge. This could eventually lead to creating intellectual capital, which would ultimately enhance organizational learning and increase student achievement. The primary purpose of this study is to identify, examine and compare the role of two school district offices in supporting or constraining learning initiatives of schools within their district. This will allow us to describe optimal organizational conditions that support student performance over time. The research design of this project is a comparative case study that used quantitative extant data and qualitative methods to answer three main research questions. The findings from this study indicated that principal autonomy is crucial for the success of reform initiative implementation and organizational learning

Early Response-to-Intervention Measures and Criteria as Predictors of Reading Disability in 3rd Grade
Reading is the most valuable skill children must master early in schooling. Unfortunately, many students struggle to read and may be identified as having a Reading Disability (RD).  In this dissertation, I explored the usefulness of the Response-to-Intervention (RtI) framework for identifying children with RD by examining the use of 1st and 2nd grade reading measures and responsiveness criteria for predicting RD in 3rd grade.  Data were derived from a longitudinal RtI project executed in low-income, high-poverty schools in Southern California.  Participants attended one of five schools from 1st to 3rd grade and had access to a high-quality Tier II intervention during their attendance.  I used logistic regression to identify reading measures most useful for predicting RD in word reading/fluency (WR-F) and comprehension/vocabulary (C-V) separately; I then paired intervention responsiveness criteria with significant predictors and explored RD classification accuracy using 2x2 contingency tables.  Model-based results generally yielded superior classification accuracy compared to single-measure predictors of RD; however, 1st grade word identification and 2nd grade oral reading fluency showed promise as isolated measures for predicting RD in WR-F.  Model-based predictions were required to obtain adequate classification accuracy for RD in C-V.   While the former finding is promising for early identification of those students in need of more intensive instruction in lexical or fluency-based skills, the latter finding reaffirms literature attesting to the complexity of RD in comprehension and difficulty of predicting such deficits using early measures of reading, which principally assess word reading skill. Models and classification analyses replicated well with an independent sample, thus enhancing confidence in study results. Practical implications and need for future research are discussed.

Reading, writing, and social justice : a middle school investigation of audism
A major goal in secondary education is social justice. Based on Cummins' framework for the empowerment of minority students, a bilingual curriculum centered persuasive writing was designed and implemented, encouraging the analysis of literature and social justice. The curriculum provides students the opportunity to read about deaf characters, study discrimination, analyze persuasion in the news, as well as participate in Writer's Workshop and the bilingual writing process. Deaf students participated in a study of discrimination in the world with a primary focus of Audism. The curriculum addresses Audism in multiple facets, allowing students to make associations to readings, as well as their own lives. This cross-content study promotes the advocacy by means of persuasive writing

Perceptions of Emergency Department Crowding in Pennsylvania
Introduction: The state of emergency department (ED) crowding in Pennsylvania has not previously been reported.
      Methods: We assessed perceptions of ED crowding by surveying medical directors/chairs from Pennsylvania EDs in the spring of 2008.
      Results: A total of 106 completed the questionnaire (68% response rate). A total of 83% (86/104) agreed that ED crowding was a problem; 26% (27/105) reported that at least half of admitted patients boarded for more than 4 hours. Ninety-eight percent (102/104) agreed that patient satisfaction suffers during crowding and 79% (84/106) stated that quality suffers. Sixty-five percent (68/105) reported that crowding had worsened during the past 2 years. Several hospital interventions were used to alleviate crowding: expediting discharges, 81% (86/106); prioritizing ED patients for inpatient beds, 79% (84/ 106); and ambulance diversion, 55% (57/105). Almost all respondents who had improved ED operations reported that it had reduced crowding.
      Conclusion: ED crowding is a common problem in Pennsylvania and is worsening in the majority of hospitals, despite the implementation of a variety of interventions. West J EmergMed. 2013;14(1):1–10.

Successes and challenges of instructional strategies in two-way bilingual immersion
Growing numbers of English Learners (ELs) in public education are placed in a variety of second language programs across the nation. Policymakers, educators, and parents are indecisive on which programs are most beneficial for the linguistic and cultural needs of ELs. Empirical studies on two-way bilingual immersion (TWBI) programs seem to provide promising data for ELs receiving content instruction in their primary language while acquiring second language acquisition skills in classrooms where students are integrated with native English speakers. The goals of TWBI programs are for all students to become bilingual, biliterate, and bicultural. This study examined the instructional strategies teachers used to develop biliteracy and cross-cultural competence in TWBI. A single case study approach allowed the researcher to gain insights about the implementation of strategies in two TWBI programs in Southern California. The methods included multiple measures to collect and analyze the data through photo-elicitation journals, appreciative inquiry interviews, lesson observations, teacher reflections, and questionnaires. The sample population for this case study included nine bilingual teachers in TWBI programs with 90/ 10 model designs in grades first through sixth. First, the research synthesized how the teachers gained their knowledge-base and professional support to implement their strategies. Second, the findings discussed how the framework for the Guiding Principles for Dual Language Education assisted teachers in the implementation of their instructional strategies. Third, the data analysis described the successes and challenges in the teachers' instructional strategies to develop biliteracy and cross- cultural competence with ELs and English Proficient students in their classrooms. Lastly, the study discussed how the teachers gained new insights about their practices based on their successes and challenges in their strategies. Results of the study demonstrated that teachers were very experienced and knowledgeable in TWBI practices and supported each other through planning and lesson development. Teachers implemented strategies aligned to the four main guiding principles of instruction : research-based practices, instructional strategies, student-centered instruction, and multicultural/ multilingual learning environments. Convergence of multiple measures indicated that teachers experienced successes and challenges in their instructional strategies for biliteracy and cross-cultural competence, but established new perspectives and innovations to advance their practice

Persistence of Latino students in community colleges : an empowerment model addressing acculturative stress
College student persistence has been a concern of researchers and practitioners since the early 1960s. Traditional models have addressed the need for students to be integrated into the academic and social domains of the college campus. Recently, critical theorists and researchers have been questioning the relevance of the traditional models for students of color. The development of student empowerment through the establishment of student-initiated retention projects and the support of institutional agents has been proposed as a more meaningful goal to increase the persistence of students of color. Ethnic student organizations have also been shown to be important in giving students of color a sense of belonging. While acculturative stress has been shown to be a factor in the well-being of Latino students, it has not been considered as a contributor to persistence decisions. This study used mixed methods to collect data from surveys and interviews of Latino community college students. Analysis of this data showed that persistence is negatively correlated to acculturative stress. Additionally, certain acculturation strategies play a role in the persistence decisions of students. Both traditional and emerging models of persistence are compared in order to propose a new model which includes consideration of acculturative stress and student empowerment

Looking for patterns of injustice in the everyday : critical inquiry as common classroom practice
Much of the work that students do in high school classrooms does not call for students to seek a full understanding of what they are learning. This lack of depth often leaves students unprepared for the difficult work they will encounter in college. Research suggests that involving students in topics that interest them, as well as providing them with an authentic audience increases their motivation, and also helps students think more deeply about their work. The Looking for Patterns of Injustice in the Everyday (LPI) curriculum asks students to decide on and research an inequality in their community, then to share their findings with those who can make change. LPI was implemented in a large Southern California high school classroom with students from mainly Hispanic, and low-income backgrounds. Students who participated in LPI completed regular reflections and compiled reports of their findings, as well as a presentation to share with an adult audience. To evaluate students' growth, the teacher/ researcher observed and recorded their conversations, as well as looked closely at the work they were producing. The data collected showed that students began to use evidence more as well as engage in higher level thinking about their classwork. They also became more motivated as they shared their findings with others. Students became more active in their community as they began to seek ways to correct the injustices they discovered. The results of the implementation indicates that by giving students an authentic audience and topic, teachers have the potential to promote student understanding, as well as increase their engagement on and off campus

Sexual Politics in the California Public K-12 Superintendency and District Office Personnel System
A review of literature suggests women superintendents face several disadvantages gaining access to positions as public school district superintendents. This study focused on 1) which characteristics applied to the prediction of women superintendents in California public K-12 system; 2) if the predecessor's sex predicted for the successor's sex; 3) whether the percentages of  women districts office staff changed because of districts' hiring of women superintendents. The data include districts that appointed new superintendents between 2000 and 2008, N=1690. Logistic regression was used and found doctoral degree, years of educational service, years in the district, large suburbs and large cities, API, and student enrollment total were the seven predictors show significance for women superintendents. Cross-tabulation was then applied to test whether the predecessor's sex influences the successor's sex, ÷² (1) = 1120 .361, p = .000 < .05, revealing that the association between superintendent's sex before turnover was significant. That is, if districts had women superintendents before, it is easier for women successors to enter these districts again. One repeated, one within ANOVA was used to test whether superintendent's sex influence the percentage of female district staff. The results found it was not significant to determine the rate of increase based on superintendent's sex. Women superintendents did not increased the percentages of female district office staff; rather, women were more likely to enter districts with larger female principal percentages than men. The percentages of female principals and student services staff increased overtime for both women and men superintendents, but the rate of increase was not significant.This study concludes with only examining the percentages of new hired women superintendents, there were 27.3%. However, if we used historical record of women superintendents, the percentages increased from 8.25% in 1985 to 31.7% in 2008. Women superintendents won a small numbers of districts that used to be men. If we examined by the high status districts, women superintendents were more likely to be in large suburbs and large cities with higher API scores than men superintendents.

Small School Sustainability: A Study of Tensions and Solutions for Small School Teachers
This study explored the unique issues that small school teachers face as school leaders and as teachers. Teachers and principals from three small public high schools participated in interviews and focus groups in which they discussed frustrating tensions (i.e., long hours, equity amongst teacher inputs, teacher buy-in) teachers experienced in their small schools and, by extension, potentially damaging forces to small school sustainability. I found that many teachers valued the opportunities to be teacher leaders, to collaborate, and to make meaningful changes in their schools, but they felt overwhelmed and frustrated by aspects of their school culture and structures which interfered with their capacities to do so. Some teachers felt isolated in their professional communities. Some felt overwhelmed by the demands put upon them. And some felt a lack of support from school leaders.This study is relevant to teachers and leaders in small schools as well as leaders of the small school movement. It recommends that small school leaders establish a leadership model that fits the vision of their school and their community of teachers at the same time. Small school leaders also need to bring teachers to the table for vision-forming conversations, even if it means revisiting the same conversations and re-crafting the school vision year after year. Just as small school teachers should be integral participants in their school leadership practices and in the development of school vision, their voices should also be heard when it comes to designing teacher supports. To that end, small school leaders need to make practices meaningful and honest for teachers when designing support programs.

Robert L. Sinsheimer: The University of California, Santa Cruz During a Critical Decade, 1977-1987
Randall Jarrell, documentary historian and head of the Regional History Project, conducted seven hours of taped interviews with Sinsheimer, UCSCs fourth chancellor during 1990-91, as part of the Project's University History series.
      Sinsheimer was appointed chancellor by UC President David Saxon in June, 1977. Formerly chairman of the division of biology at the California Institute of Technology where his work as a molecular biologist had earned him a distinguished international reputation. When approached with an invitation to consider heading UCSC he had come to the end of a long period of research and was receptive to a new challenge. His pre-eminent knowledge of the social implications and potential hazards of recombinant DNA technology and cloning methods in biology had deepened his concern about the necessity of promoting scientific literacy among non-scientists. Thus the UCSC chancellorship appealed to him since as a public institution it would give him a forum in which he could address these concerns.
      Sinsheimer was UCSC's first chancellor from outside the UC system. His predecessors included founding Chancellor Dean E. McHenry who had presided over the planning and building of the innovative campus from 1961 until his retirement in June, 1974. McHenry was succeeded by Mark Christensen, a professor of geology from UC Berkeley, whose brief tenure was concluded by his resignation in January 1976, after only a year and a half as chancellor. Angus Taylor, a veteran UC administrator, was appointed Chancellor in February 1976, and during his tenure stabilized the fledgling campus while a permanent chancellor was selected.
      Sinsheimer arrived to find a campus in need of direction with serious systemic problems. As an outsider he saw UCSC's organization and administration undermining its relationship with the larger UC system, of which it was a small and to some, rather insignificant member.
      UCSC's promising academic reputation and innovative early identity had significantly deteriorated by the time Sinsheimer arrived. The outside world (as well as segments of the Santa Cruz community) had come, however wrongly, to view UCSC as a flakey, hippie school, with a questionable academic reputation. Vietnam War demonstrations, drugs, and the campus's counterculture increasingly strained town-gown relations and UCSC's reputation throughout the state. Enrollment figures were down and there were rumors (unfounded) that the campus would be closed for budgetary reasons.
      In this volume, Sinsheimer describes why his tenure was a critical decade for the troubled campus. He discusses the many problems he encountered -- the campus's lack of a sense of direction, its ambiguous academic reputation, its complicated administrative structure -- and the changes and reforms he initiated to solve them and bring the campus more into line with the way other UC campuses operated. He also discusses his role as chancellor and the contributions he made to the campus's development, including the Keck Telescope and Human Genome Projects. He also talks frankly about controversies engendered by the Research and Development Park Initiative, college reorganization, the anti-apartheid and divestiture movement, and student activism. His narration includes a prescient analysis of why the UCSC of the 1970s needed to be more closely related to Silicon Valley and the region's proliferating high technology industries. His goal of establishing an engineering school was not realized during his tenure, but the work Sinsheimer accomplished in reorganizing and revitalizing the campus paved the way for one day having such schools at UCSC.

The Ghost of the Bomb : the Bravo Medical Program, scientific uncertainty, and the legacy of U.S. Cold War science, 1954-2005
After more than 50 years, controversy persists over the effects of radioactive fallout from the 1954 "Bravo" hydrogen bomb test. Although most scholars agree that the exposure was a tragic accident, popular accounts continue to portray the Marshallese as human guinea pigs, victims of scientific imperialism and Cold War atomic politics. Analyzing the historical records of pertinent activist groups as well as government documents of the long-term medical program that was created in response to the exposure - the "Bravo Medical Program" - this study describes why the question defies closure. Like many Cold War studies, the Medical Program blurred the lines between medical care and research, and between civilian and military needs. The Program's multi-decade continuation meant that it became subject to a wide variety of social, political, cultural, and ethical changes. While relatively uncontroversial in the 1950s, when the threat of nuclear war appeared imminent, the Program became suspect in the 1960s and 1970s, when the Marshall Islands struggled toward political independence and human rights campaigns took place world-wide. In the Marshall Islands, antinuclear and anti-colonial activists argued that radiation science was uncertain and open to many interpretations, and that government scientists could not be trusted to be objective. At the same time, the Marshall Islands Government tried to use the exposures to their advantage. The needs of the exposed often became lost in the tumult. My work demonstrates that political and social concerns, more than ethical ones, were the primary basis for charges of human experimentation. Today, uncertainty lingers. Yet the science produced by the Bravo Medical Program continues to be used by all parties in public policy and compensation claims debates because diverse groups still believe that, whatever its shortcomings, science offers a greater promise of objectivity than politics. By offering a nuanced view of a controversial topic, this dissertation contributes to studies about health and environmental debates with public policy implications, as well as the growing literature on the civilian consequences of Cold War atomic science

Talking Math, Blogging Math is a curriculum designed to aid middle school Pre- Algebra students' mathematical problem-solving through the use of academic language instruction, explanatory proofs, and online technology (blogging). Talking Math, Blogging Math was implemented over a period of ten weeks during the 2008 - 2009 school year. The school where the curriculum was implemented is a non-traditional classroom-based charter school. The 7th, 8th and 9th grade students attended class twice a week. The goals of the Talking Math, Blogging Math curriculum were to increase use and understanding of mathematical terminology, to facilitate students' use of problem solving by teaching them metacognitive strategies, and to use blog technology to extend the Pre-Algebra community of practice beyond the classroom. The students received direct instruction in academic language related to the mathematical content being studied. Students learned metacognitive strategies in the context of simple two- column and paragraph explanatory proofs. Students communicated with each other on the blog about mathematical concepts covered in class. Methods for evaluating Talking Math, Blogging Math included examination of students' work, blog entries, and interviews. Final analysis of Talking Math, Blogging Math revealed that students used varied metacognitive processes when creating mathematical proofs. These metacognitive processes transferred to their general problem-solving. The findings suggest that the students increased their use and understanding of mathematical vocabulary. In addition, the students created a community of discourse based on the explanatory proofs

School Governance, Teacher Incentives, and Pupil-Teacher Ratios: Experimental Evidence from Kenyan Primary Schools
Some education policymakers focus on bringing down pupil-teacher ratios. Others argue that resources will have limited impact without systematic reforms to education governance, teacher incentives, and pedagogy. We examine a program under which Kenyan Parent-Teacher Associations (PTAs) at randomly selected schools were funded to hire an additional teacher on a renewable contract, outside normal Ministry of Education civil-service channels, at one-quarter normal compensation levels. For students randomly assigned to stay with existing classes, test scores did not increase significantly, despite a reduction in class size from 82 to 44. In contrast, scores increased for students assigned to be taught by locally-hired contract teachers. One reason may be that contract teachers had low absence rates, while centrally-hired civil-service teachers in schools randomly assigned PTA contract teachers endogenously reduced their effort. Civilservice teachers also captured rents for their families, with approximately 1/3 of contract teacher positions going to relatives of existing teachers. A governance program that empowered parents within PTAs reduced both forms of capture. The best contract teachers obtained civil service jobs over time, and we estimate large potential dynamic benefits from supplementing a civil service system with locally-hired contract teachers brought in on a probationary basis and granted tenure conditional on performance.

Student-Teacher Relationships in Early Elementary School and Impact on Later Academic Engagement
Teachers have many roles that make them influential in a child's overall development at school. The relationship formed between teachers and students early on may foreshadow adjustment and functioning of the student in later school years. A conditional latent curve model was fit to data from a subsample of the longitudinal Collaborative Family Study (n=84) and used to examine the effects of the student-teacher relationship (STR) change over time (ages 6-9) in predicting academic engagement at age 13 for both typically developing (TD) children and those with intellectual delays (ID). This model was then expanded to include the child characteristics of social skills and behavior problems in predicting STR.  Results indicated that age 6 STR's predicted academic engagement at age 13; students who experienced more positive STR's very early in elementary school had higher levels of academic engagement in middle school.  In addition, the child characteristics of social skills and behavior problems were predictive of the STR, and accounted for more variance within academic engagement than the STR alone.   These findings emphasize the impact of the student-teacher relationship during the early school years, and underscore its importance for later formative experiences.

Better Outcomes, Lower Costs: Palliative Care Program Reduces Stress, Costs of Care for Children With Life-Threatening Conditions
SUMMARY: This policy brief examines the Partners for Children (PFC) program—California’s public pediatric community-based palliative care benefit to children living with life-threatening conditions and their families. Preliminary analysis of administrative and survey data indicates that participation in the PFC program improves quality of life for the child and family. In addition, participation in the program resulted in a one-third reduction in the average number of days spent in the hospital. Shifting care from a hospital setting to in-home community-based care resulted in cost savings of $1,677 per child per month on average—an 11% decrease in spending on a traditionally high-cost population. As the three-year pilot program draws to an end, policymakers are considering the advisability of extending the program beyond the 11 counties that now participate.

Established and Novel Initiatives to Reduce Crowding in Emergency Departments
Introduction:The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) Task Force on Boarding described high-impact initiatives to decrease crowding. Furthermore, some emergency departments (EDs) have implemented a novel initiative we term “vertical patient flow,” i.e. segmenting patients who can be safely evaluated, managed, admitted or discharged without occupying a traditional ED room. We sought to determine the degree that ACEP-identified high-impact initiatives for ED crowding and vertical patient flow have been implemented in academic EDs in the United States (U.S.).
      Methods:We surveyed the physician leadership of all U.S. academic EDs from March to May 2010 using a 2-minute online survey. Academic ED was defined by the primary site of an emergency residency program.
      Results:We had a response rate of 73% (106/145) and a completion rate of 71% (103/145). The most prevalent hospital-based initiative was inpatient discharge coordination (46% 47/103 of respondents) while the least fully initiated was surgical schedule smoothing (11% 11/103). The most prevalent ED-based initiative was fast track (79% 81/103) while the least initiated was physician triage (12% 12/103). Vertical patient flow had been implemented in 29% (30/103) of responding EDs while an additional 41% (42/103) reported partial/in progress implementation.
      Conclusion:We found great variability in the extent academic EDs have implemented ACEP’s established high-impact ED crowding initiatives, yet most (70%) have adopted to some extent the novel initiative vertical patient flow. Future studies should examine barriers to implementing these crowding initiatives and how they affect outcomes such as patient safety, ED throughput and patient/provider satisfaction.

Dynamic Instruction Fusion
Energy efficiency in modern microprocessor design is a first order concern.  Every facet of the microprocessor needs to be optimized now to be efficient in accesses, storage, and instruction execution.  Dynamic Instruction Fusion provides a means to accomplish all three of these goals.  By leveraging register re-use within typical instruction streams, whether generated through the use of a trace cache, or through wide issue instruction logic, it is possible to simultaneously reduce both the number of accesses to the register file, as well the number of instructions stored within the instruction window.On average, Dynamic Instruction Fusion can reduce the number of instructions scheduled by ~ 48%, while simultaneously reducing the number of accesses to the register file by ~30%.  This reduction in both the number of register file accesses and instruction window entries directly corresponds to a saving in energy in the register file.

Solving Out Loud : using discourse as a means to promote problem solving, motivation, and metacognition in a mathematics classroom
Classroom communication can often be a teacher-centered discussion. Due to the teacher centered format of discussions students are not engaging in meaningful discourse in mathematics classroom, which is part of the NCTM 2000 Standards as well as a necessary component to learning. Students can only learn communication skills when discourse is a central feature from the classroom. In addition, students must explicitly learn problem-solving skills. Unfortunately, many of these features are absent from today's classrooms. This research investigates the connection between discourse and problem solving in a ninth and tenth Geometry classroom. Solving Out Loud is a curriculum that was developed to increase students' confidence and ability in problem solving as well as students' mathematical discourse skills, students' motivation, and finally students' metacognition of mathematical learning. Students participating in this study were involved in large student-centered discussions either based on a single question, such as "what motivates you to learn?" or based on the different procedures to solving particular problems. Solving Out Loud was evaluated with data from the students' work, recorded class conversations, teacher field notes, and pre and post surveys. This data showed an increase in students' problem solving skills and students' confidence in their ability to discuss their problem solving strategies. The findings imply that student-centered conversations benefit the development of students' problem solving and discourse skills

Understanding and Self-Advocacy: Students with Learning Disabilities, Unrecognized Talent
This is the first phase of a two-phase project that looks at the relationship between diagnostic testing and self-advocacy for students with learning disabilities (LD) within post-secondary education. In this first phase, data was obtained using in-depth, semi-structured interviews with professionals within the field of LD: three learning specialists, two administration staff, and five LD testing administrators. All data was thematically coded. Two four-year public universities in Northern California (one, a prominent research institution) participated. Findings show that university administrators often see students with disabilities as having less “economic value” than students without disabilities. In an effort to reduce costs, bureaucratic barriers are created through policies and burdensome documentation processes, which make it more difficult for students to gain or utilize support services. The data shows that few students understand their LDs, the diagnostic tests used, and their rights as a person legally defined as having a disability. The findings indicate that students’ primary focus is not on fully understanding their diagnosis and its implications. Rather, the initial data suggests that current policies require students to concentrate their energies on the documentation requirements to gain needed resources, and consequently, lower the possibility for self-advocacy.

Evaluating the Benefits of Integrated Child Development Program in Rural India
India suffers from widespread child malnutrition, childcare constraints on maternal employment, and gender education gap. In my  dissertation I examine the impact of India's biggest child development program - Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) - on each of these aspects. The program provides various services to children below six years, including supplementary nutrition, preschooling, immunization and health check-ups. In the first paper I look at the ``direct'' program impact on nutritional status of young children, and in the second and third, I analyze the ``indirect'' program impact on maternal employment and education of older siblings respectively. For all three papers I use data from recent demographic health survey 2005-6 for India, and for two I also substantiate my results with time use information of mothers and older siblings from another dataset.In my first paper, using matching and difference-in-difference estimators, I find that girls 0-2 years old receiving supplementary feeding intensely are at least 1cm (0.4 z-score) taller than those not receiving it in rural India. The estimates are similar for boys 0-2 but less robust. Although the program's focus is on children ages 3-5, I find no positive effect on their growth. In the second paper, using probit, covariate matching and conditional logit (village fixed-effects), I find that the mother, whose child is receiving highly correlated services of regular preschooling or daily supplementary feeding, is 12\% more likely to work in rural India. Using similar estimation strategy (including mother fixed-effects), in my third paper I find that the girl 6-14 years, having a younger sibling below 5 years receiving any of the ICDS services intensely, is at least 9\% more likely to be in school in rural India. The effect on boys 6-14 years is positive, but not robust. Because of various program services, the ``indirect'' benefits can accrue through several pathways: time saving because of release from child supervision, improvement in health of young children and implicit income subsidy. For maternal employment it seems that the effect seems to be driven mainly by the daycare implicit in preschooling, and for the girl's education by health benefits of vaccinations of younger children.

The Construction of Professional Identity and Pathways of Participation of Full Time Faculty Members in University Restructuring in Mexico
Since the 1990s, the federal government required public state universities in Mexico to recruit full time faculty members with doctoral degrees and research productivity to increase the academic competitiveness of higher education. After  two decades of the implementation of federal mandates, public state universities have not improved their academic life significantly (Chavoya-Peña, et al., 2006). The failure of federal programs for university restructuring can be understood from a variety of perspectives. Central to this failure is the faculty body. Based on a case study approach, this investigation sought to understand the ways in which full time faculty members that entered state public universities since 1996 as part of the Faculty Enhancement Program (PROMEP) negotiate their professional identity within a climate of university restructuring in Mexico. The case site was a public state university in the state of Morelos (UM) in the central valley of Mexico. This investigation included three research questions: What are the contextual factors for the negotiation of academic identity? What are the practices that enable full time faculty to negotiate their academic identity? What are the characteristics of the academic identity of full time faculty? Organizational theory, cultural theory, and professional identity theory shaped the theoretical framework. Empirical data collected through semi-structured interviews, participant observation, and document analysis was interpreted through analytical induction (Erickson, 1986) and reflexive analysis (Aunger, 1995). Three central findings are presented. First, full time faculty members at UM self-defined as researchers. Full time faculty members negotiated their academic identity within two types of Faculties: parochial and modern Faculties. Each type of Faculty had a different cultural orientation and social structure to organize academic life. Second, full time faculty members stressed their reluctance to participate in committee work; yet they engaged actively in institutional service activities in order to create organizational conditions that facilitated the development of research and teaching. Third, through strategies of self-regulation, full time faculty members negotiated three types of self-definitions: the academic as researcher, the academic as change-maker, and the academic as saturated worker. Contributions of this study, implications for practice, and pathways for further research are discussed.

A sustainable model for training teachers to use pivotal response training
The increase in the rate of autism diagnoses has created a growing demand for teachers who are trained to use effective interventions. Research supports behavioral interventions as effective methods for teaching children with autism, however dissemination of these methods has been problematic. Ineffective training and lack of ongoing support after formal training ends may be to blame. The train-the-trainer (TTT) model, which involves training supervisors to train others, may be ideal for providing cost-effective training and ongoing support to teachers. This study assessed the benefits of using the TTT model to disseminate Pivotal Response Training (PRT), an evidence- based practice for educating children with autism, to school settings. A multiple baseline design was conducted across three training groups, each consisting of one school staff member (trainer), three special education teachers, and six students. During baseline, each trainer observed interactions between teacher/student dyads and provided feedback to the teachers. During treatment, trainers learned to implement and assess PRT themselves and educated teachers on PRT during a workshop. After the teacher-training workshop, trainers continued to observe interactions between teacher/student dyads and provide feedback to teachers during weekly classroom observations. A follow-up assessment was conducted three months after training was complete. Assessments included trainer and teacher ability to implement PRT, trainer ability to assess PRT and provide feedback, and student language and behavioral changes. All trainers conducted the teacher- training workshop with high adherence to training protocol and met mastery criteria in their ability to implement PRT, assess implementation of PRT, and provide feedback to teachers. Both trainers' assessment of PRT and feedback to teachers were more variable during post-workshop classroom observations. Six of the nine teachers mastered all components of PRT. The remaining three teachers implemented 89% of the PRT components correctly. The majority of trainers and teachers maintained their abilities at follow-up. Students demonstrated limited behavioral change, although this was not unexpected as the intervention was minimal and exposure to other interventions was not controlled for as part of the study. These results provide support for the use of the TTT model as an effective method of disseminating evidence-based practices in school settings

To jump or not to jump : community college faculty perceptions of administrative positions as a career path
Studies have sounded the alarm concerning the impending void of leadership that community colleges will face in the 21st century. One concern is that the pool of applicants from the traditional leadership pathway of existing community college faculty members has decreased dramatically in the past decade. This study explored faculty perceptions of the administration positions in California community colleges and their desire and willingness to step into these roles. The study also looked at the impact of the underlying issues associated with the motivation for life-work balance on the likelihood of community college faculty to apply for administrative positions. This study was conducted through a mixed-method design involving quantitative and qualitative data collection. A survey was sent to all tenured and tenure-track faculty at community colleges in San Diego County, California. There were 341 participants who completed the survey, yielding a response rate of 22.7%. The first research question sought to explore faculty's perceptions of the administration positions at California community colleges and their desire to step into those roles. Three themes emerged in analyzing the responses of why faculty consider going into administration: (1) improve the system or college; make a difference, (2) personal growth and challenge, and (3) salary and/or benefits. In addition, five main themes emerged from reasons why faculty would not consider jumping into administration: (1) workload, stress, and lack of flexibility for family time; (2) lack of job satisfaction due to bureaucracy, incompetent colleagues, or system; (3) love of teaching and profession; (4) lack of job security; and (5) going to the "dark" side. The second research question sought to explore to what extent motivators for life-work balance affect the decision of California community college faculty to leap to administration. The motivators for life-work balance do influence the faculty in the decision to jump into administration; however, there was no significant difference between Generation X and the baby boom generation's belief in achieving the balance. The study concludes with recommendations to community college administrators, board of trustees and faculty

What do we measure? : understanding how leadership measures the benefits of after-school physical activities in the continuation school setting
The purpose of this exploratory and descriptive qualitative study was to understand the data used by teachers and administrators to determine the benefits of time spent in after-school athletics and exercise programs on the academic performance of students in three continuation high schools in California. Using student focus group interviews, teacher and staff interviews, and document analysis, this study seeks to understand the nature of after-school athletics and exercise programs in these schools, how they meet the needs of these students, and the role of administrators and teachers in leading these programs and tracking how these programs may benefit students academically as well as physically. Key findings include a relationship between funding and increased teacher investment of providing after-school activities, as well as a positive relationship between adults who are on campus all day and the social-emotional investment and connection of the students to the school and their own learning. Key data sources are generally not systemically used to measure growth in behavior, investment, or academic growth, despite myriad sources of data for analysis. Students report feeling more invested in school when it seems adults through the day are caring about them by checking on their progress, even if useful data is not systematically used. Implications of this study span across leadership, practitioner, and policy considerations; research constructs; and theoretical concepts. Key factors to consider when implementing an effective program include financial support, facility considerations, preexisting physical resources, staff knowledge and interest, and an understanding of the importance of the program. Recommendations include conducting pre- and post- engagement surveys, tracking changes in grades, credit acquisition, and behavior, maintaining funding for after-school physical education programs for typically low-socioeconomic status students, recruiting facilitators who are also teachers on continuation school campuses during the regular school hours, using existing data sources to guide decisions, and reconsidering theoretical frameworks to better understand the student-in-context as an individual with agency to pursue healthy relationships with adults via mentoring frameworks for interactions which will facilitate resiliency and positive health habits

Governmental Failures in Evaluating Programs
Consider a government that adopts a program, sees a noisy signal about its success, and decides whether to continue the program. Suppose further that the success of a program is greater if people think it will be continued. This paper considers the optimal decision rule for continuing the program, both when government can and cannot commit. We find that welfare can be higher when information is poor, that government should at times commit to continuing a program it believes had failed, and that a government which fears losing power may acquire either too much or too little information.

Non-regular algebras of dimension 3
Finding suitable methods for associating geometry to noncommutative graded algebras has been a goal for noncommutative algebraists for the last 20 years. While one method is to study the relationship between an algebra and its associated noncommutative category Proj, another method is to examine an algebra's corresponding point modules. This dissertation describes the point modules associated to some noncommutative graded algebras of dimension 3, where the graded pieces have the same dimensions as the graded pieces of a polynomial ring. These algebras have an infinite set of point modules and are regular if and only if they are domains

Assessment of Young English Language Learners in Arizona: Questioning the Validity of the State Measure of English Proficiency
This study analyzes the Arizona policy of utilizing a single assessment of English proficiency to determine if students should be exited from the ELL program , which is ostensibly designed to make it possible for them to succeed in the mainstream classroom without any further language support. The study examines the predictive validity of this assessment instrument on ELLs' performance on state required academic achievement tests at three grade levels. It finds that at subsequent grade levels after redesignation, the "one-test" AZELLA becomes less predictive of academic achievement, That is, the test over predicts student achievement, suggesting that many students may be under-served due to their scores the test. This finding calls into question Arizona's "one-test" procedure for redesignating ELLs to a non-service category. Given the large and increasing size of the ELL student population in Arizona, the current focus on testing and accountability, and the documented problems in current assessment practices, improvement in instruments and procedures is critical. These improvements are necessary at all phases of the assessment process, but as this study indicates, the present policy is likely denying services these student need and violating the rights of these students to an equal educational opportunity.

Students' Perceptions of Black-Latino Conflicts in Public Schools
This project provides a student perspective of the so-called Black-Brown "racial" tension in Los Angeles high schools. A theoretical foundation for examining Black and Latino tensions and their structural influences is provided along with an explanation of the racialized images seen in the media that contribute to moral panic in the surrounding community and promote school practices most comparable to the prison setting. Critical race theory, internal colonial theory and deprivation approaches to explaining prison violence are employed in the debunking of media portrayals of school violence. My research is based on interviews with 20 Latino and 20 black students from affected schools. These interviews provided students' first-hand accounts of race relations in their schools and their own explanations of school violence. They reveal that the triggers of violent incidents included interpersonal conflicts that involve a romantic partner, and the maintenance and preservation of respect for romantic relationships, crews, and self. The role of the school and its responses to violent incidents is considered and the physical characteristics of the school and how it contributes to the overall prison-like experience for students is also considered.  School responses included no response, punishment for only those involved in the violent incident, and the imposition of more stringent zero-tolerance practices were the most common responses to violence. The imposition of punishments and harsher regulation of all students was reported to be the least effective method of promoting student self-regulation.

Virtual Discussion for Real Understanding: The Use of an Online Discussion Board in an Introductory Biostatistics Course
One of the challenges of teaching is engaging students in a subject they may not see as relevant to them. This issue is especially prevalent when teaching statistics to health science students as many do not consider statistics an important piece of their medical training. Additional difficulty is presented when teaching courses via distance technology or courses that are partially or completely online as the valuable class discussion component is lost. This paper focuses on fostering “discussion” about statistical concepts and how they relate to each student on an individual level. This paper describes the online discussion board as a tool incorporated to supplement classroom activities and not as one to be limited to the online class. Two activities where the discussion board can be utilized are described: one where students participate in a series of guided discussions through instructor provided, thought-provoking questions and another where students critique an article related to their field of study and post for discussion. The objectives are to enhance knowledge, develop critical thinking, gain an appreciation of how statistics is used in different fields, and provide opportunities for discussion outside the classroom. Students are able to discuss issues with classmates who can be in the classroom or abroad using a virtual environment.  This approach has been successfully used in both purely online classes and in large graduate level biostatistics classes including both synchronous and asynchronous distance learners.

[faculty, student, quality]

Two Studies of a Faculty in Crisis
The fundamental asset of a university is its faculty. Without faculty working with students, the university is just a set of buildings. The faculty design and teach the courses, keep the educational program updated, and work with students to help them gain the skills and knowledge they need to prepare for their careers or professional education. The quality of faculty is very directly linked to the quality of a student’s education and the value of the degree.  The research released in these two new studies from the Civil Rights Project shows that the budget cutbacks at the California State University system are already reducing the quality of education faculty can offer students.  The CSU now faces large additional cuts. Faculty Under Siege, is based on a survey of more than four hundred faculty across the CSU system and it shows that the main sources of stress that appear to affect job satisfaction and the quality of teaching are increased class sizes and teaching loads, a lack of personal time, not receiving support and supplies from the system, working with underprepared students, and advising an increasing number of students. This web-based survey collected data on 424 faculty; 76% are full-time employees of their institution, and the majority of respondents teach at only one campus. In addition, 47% had tenure at the time of the survey, with an additional 22% on tenure track.

The purpose of this research was to examine the ways in which the non-academic factors were used in conjunction with the academic factors in today's undergraduate comprehensive admissions review process at the University of California. This research sought to clarify whether there was a differential impact on how African-American, White/Caucasian, and Latino students were admitted via the University of California's Comprehensive Review process. This study further sought to determine if there was a difference in the academic profile among African-American, White/Caucasian, and Latino students admitted to the University of California under the Comprehensive Review process. This study's focus was to determine how the University of California's Undergraduate comprehensive admissions review process affected the access to the University of California across ethnicity. Analysis for this study included the use of a descriptive statistical technique and path analysis statistical procedure to analyze and determine if any of the academic or non- academic variables presented in this study contributed to admissibility to the University of California via the Comprehensive Review process through the use of cross- tabulation tables. Using descriptive statistics and a path analysis statistical procedure allowed the researcher to not only explore the relationship that the non-academic variables had in determining admissions for African- American, White/Caucasian, and Latino students in the Comprehensive Review process, but it also allowed the researcher to analyze the role that the academic variables had in determining the admissibility of African-American, White/Caucasian, and Latino students to the University of California

Multimedia Education Increases Elder Knowledge of Emergency Department Care
Introduction: Elders who utilize the emergency department (ED) may have little prospective knowledge of appropriate expectations during an ED encounter. Improving elder orientation to ED expectations is important for satisfaction and health education. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a multi-media education intervention as a method for informing independently living elders about ED care. The program delivered messages categorically as, the number of tests, providers, decisions and disposition decision making. 
      
         Methods: Interventional trial of representative elders over 59 years of age comparing pre and post multimedia program exposure. A brief (0.3 hour) video that chronicled the key events after a hypothetical 911 call for chest pain was shown. The video used a clinical narrator, 15 ED health care providers, and 2 professional actors for the patient and spouse. Pre- and post-video tests results were obtained with audience response technology (ART) assessed learning using a 4 point Likert scale. 
      
         Results: Valid data from 142 participants were analyzed pre to post rankings (Wilcoxon signed-rank tests). The following four learning objectives showed significant improvements: number of tests expected median differences on a 4-point Likert scale with 95% confidence intervals: 0.50 (0.00, 1.00); number of providers expected 1.0 (1.00, 1.50); communications 1.0 (1.00, 1.50); and pre-hospital medical treatment 0.50 (0.00, 1.00). Elders (96%) judged the intervention as improving their ability to cope with an ED encounter. 
      
         Conclusion: A short video with graphic side-bar information is an effective educational strategy to improve elder understanding of expectations during a hypothetical ED encounter following calling 911. West J Emerg Med 2013;14(2):132-136.

Learning in human-dolphin interactions at zoological facilities
This research aimed to better understand learning in zoological settings, particularly learning about marine mammals, by investigating the research question, what do people learn through interacting with dolphins in zoological facilities? Sociocultural situated learning theory, specifically a Community of Practice (CoP) model of learning (Lave & Wenger, 1991), was the theoretical framework. The CoP model allowed for diversity of knowledge, interest, motivations, and goals that existed among the community of animal enthusiasts at three commercial zoological facilities, and also for peripheral to more central types of participation. I collected data through interviews of spectators, visitors, and trainers (n=51), observations (n=16), and an online questionnaire of past-visitors (n=933). Data were coded, categorized, and analyzed based on the National Science Foundation's (Friedman, 2008) and the National Research Council's (2009) frameworks for informal science education. Five principal findings answered the research question. First, all participants gained new knowledge within three broad categories: (a) dolphin physiology and natural history, (b) care and training of dolphins, and (c) conservation. Second, all participants constructed personal meanings by connecting the activity to experiences, beliefs, and practices outside the interaction context. Almost all participants made associations with conservation. Third, most participants shifted their attitudes and gained a sense of personal agency about beginning or increasing stewardship actions. Fourth, visitors learned interspecies etiquette skills; trainers learned skills in dolphin training and management, people management, and teaching. Fifth, visitors had long-lasting memories of the experience that occurred eight months to 18 years in the past. Popular cultural ideas about dolphins and the ways the dolphins were represented influenced visitors' expectations and the types of learning. Potential physical mediators of learning were close proximity to living dolphins and eye-to-eye immersion. Potential social mediators were membership in the CoP, and interacting with experts and co-participants. In the personal realm, potential mediators were the participants' strong affective responses to the experience, including interest, engagement, positive emotions, and feelings of affinity to the dolphins. The collective influences appeared to move participants towards stronger identities as environmentally-caring and responsible individuals who take stewardship action

Teacher retention : an appreciative approach
Nationally, the problem of teacher retention compounds the unstable nature of the educational situation, especially in urban, high-needs schools. Much of the instability of urban schools is due to teacher movement, the migration of teachers from school to another school within or between school districts, particularly from high-needs schools. Existing quantitative research about teacher movement cites working conditions generally as an area for improvement; however, the voices of teachers and details about their experiences are missing from the existing body of research. This qualitative study, situated in an approach of Appreciative Inquiry, was conducted in one small high school district that serves a mid-sized city in Southern California. This school district consisted of four high schools with the following variables : two comprehensive schools with higher percentages of students of color and lower socio-economic status; one comprehensive school with lower percentages of students of color and higher socio-economic status; and one continuation school with higher percentages of students of color and lower socio-economic status. Using similar representation from each high school, there are many individual variables concerning the fifteen participants : the variety of race and gender; the wide range in years of experience and the number of previous school sites of employment; and, the representation of many academic departments. Participants identified the working conditions and support most influential to them. The following are the findings based on their input, listed in order of significance : colleague support, professional development, district hiring practices, site administrator support, district office support, autonomy, teaching assignments, workplace culture, personal satisfaction, communication, respect, and teacher induction support. Implications regarding the employment of working conditions by school district personnel and school site administrators to increase teacher retention are discussed in chapter five. These implications include (a) the creation of a respectful workplace culture, (b) the utilization of communication with teachers, the provision of individualized and site-based support for novice teachers, (c) the distribution of an equitable schedule of classes to all teachers, (d) the implementation of information-rich hiring practices, (e) the emphasis of the focus on student learning, and (f) the presentation of constructive feedback about instructional practices to promote professional growth of teachers

Formative Assessment, Equity, and Opportunity to Learn
This dissertation presents three studies that were designed to examine formative assessment from a sociocultural perspective. The first study presents the development, inter-rater reliability, and use of the Formative Assessment and Interaction Record (FAIR), which is a measure for documenting teachers' use of formative assessment and additional research-based instructional strategies. The FAIR was created to serve several interrelated purposes: (a) to document teachers' strategy use, (b) to allow teachers and schools to set specific goals for changes in instruction and to provide a means to document those changes, (c) to provide a tool for principals to use in their efforts to develop professional learning communities focused on equity in achievement, and (d) to encourage collaborative reflection and dialogue that is focused on the use of research-based strategies as a means to extend students' opportunities to learn. The goal of this study was to construct a reliable tool that could support district administrators and site principals in their collaborative efforts to increase teachers' use of formative assessment and equity-focused strategies. The second study is a qualitative investigation of collaboration between site and district leaders to engage teachers in inquiry and analysis of teacher performance data and student assessment results, with a focus on formative assessment practices and their relationship to equity and opportunity to learn. Interviews were conducted with principals from six elementary schools in a district serving a diverse student population with 49% socioeconomically disadvantaged students and 38% English learners. Results describe: how principals used teacher performance data to increase teachers' use of research-based formative assessment practices, the means by which principals facilitated the formative use of assessment data through teacher inquiry, and principals' perceptions of how this work relates to their goals of increasing achievement, equity, and opportunity to learn.The final investigation is a case study of teacher-student dialogue in the context of a whole-class peer assessment activity to demonstrate how such formative assessment activities support the use of dialogic instruction. While numerous studies have documented the positive effects of dialogic instruction on student learning, little is known about the variety of classroom contexts that might prove more or less conducive to dialogic instruction. The research question addressed in this study was: Can formative assessment support a dialogic lesson structure? It was hypothesized that teacher-student interactions in the context of student assessment would include authentic, high-level teacher questions, high-level teacher responsiveness, a substantial proportion of time devoted to discussion, broad participation by students, and longer student responses than what is commonly associated with typical teacher-student dialogue. Results indicated that the whole-class peer assessment activity was consistent with features of dialogic instruction.

Three essays on international trade and economic development
This dissertation is composed of three self-contained chapters on international trade and economic development, with a special focus on the involvement of the government or public-funded sectors. The first chapter investigates international trade of higher education, specifically its impact on native students and native workers in the exporting country. Theoretically, I show that, in a general equilibrium model with non-profit publicly- subsidized higher education providers (HEPs) that care about both education quality and the enrollment of native students, serving foreign students may improve natives' access to higher education, which eventually benefits all native workers. Empirically, I find that, during the period 2001 to 2007, the enrollment of one more foreign student in an Australian university leads to the enrollment of around 0.75 more native students in this university. The impact is identified using an instrumental variable, generated from the interaction between demand for Australian higher education from different countries during the sample period and student networks these countries had in different Australian HEPs during 1989 to 1994. The second chapter studies commercial development in the presence of economic agglomeration of commercial goods and services, a result of consumers' love of varieties and transportation costs associated with commercial consumption. I show that a low-income community may be under-served with commercial goods and services because a developer cannot capture all the profits of a commercial project. A block grant to a developer can solve the market failure and generate a total profit bigger than the grant. Employment tax abatements alone are much less effective and much more costly. The third chapter examines the long- run impact of trade in higher education. In an overlapping generation (OG) model with a higher education sector composed of non-profit research institutions and for- profit teaching institutions, I show that importing teaching services benefits low-ability individuals by increased number of research workers in production, and that it may also benefit high-ability individuals by providing better training to skilled workers to complement research workers

Student Interviews: 1969
A series of interviews with twelve members of the first four-year graduating class at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Among the twelve were two students who had been interviewed in 1967 and four who had transferred into the class at the junior level. As in the 1967 series, the students were asked to comment on the strengths and weaknesses of the University, administration, faculty, classes, and general campus life. This they did very candidly. By happenstance, the interviews were scheduled over a two-week period that included the campus's first serious student strike and first building takeover. Thus the interviews tend to give the anatomy of the student strike as it developed. The philosophy of the students interviewed ranged from conservative to radical and their participation in the strike ranged from inactivity to leadership roles in the strike organization.

E Pluribus...Separation: Deepening Double Segregation for More Students
This report shows that segregation has increased seriously across the country for Latino students, who are attending more intensely segregated and impoverished schools than they have for generations.  The segregation increases have been the most dramatic in the West. The typical Latino student in the region attends a school where less than a quarter of their classmates are white; nearly two-thirds are other Latinos; and two-thirds are poor. California, New York and Texas, all states that have been profoundly altered by immigration trends over the last half-century, are among the most segregated states for Latino students along multiple dimensions. In spite of declining residential segregation for black families and large-scale movement to the suburbs in most parts of the country, school segregation remains very high for black students.  It is also double segregation by both race and poverty.  Nationwide, the typical black student is now in a school where almost two out of every three classmates (64%) are low-income, nearly double the level in schools of the typical white or Asian student (37% and 39%, respectively).  New York, Illinois, and Michigan consistently top the list of the most segregated states for black students.  Among the states with significant black enrollments, blacks are least likely to attend intensely segregated schools in Washington, Nebraska, and Kansas.

A History of the Founding of the Institutes of Religion, 1926-1936: A Case Study of a Religious Education Movement in American Higher Education
This study examines the founding of the Institutes of Religion, a supplementary religious education movement designed for college students sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). In 1926 the first Institute of Religion was founded at the University of Idaho in Moscow. The study examines the socio-cultural milieu of American society from 1910 through 1920, a period in which the Progressive Movement attempted to reform society. The leaders of the LDS Church were concerned with the ills of society. To help its youth, the Church expanded its private school system and emphasized its religious education programs. The next decade, 1920-1929, brought even greater concerns for the Church leaders. With the "revolution of morals and manners," they took steps to curb what they perceived as evil influences on youth and the corrupting influences upon their moral values. Two of the LDS Church's major concerns were the secularization of American society and higher education with its accompanying decline in religious faith and activity; the second concern was the increase of hedonism and materialism, which I am framing as worldliness. Another factor was the financial status of the Church and the economic recession that began in the 1920s. The Church leaders realized that they could no longer support their system of private secondary schools, the stake academies. They abandoned secular education below the college level and focused their resources on supplementary religious education programs. It was more cost effective to divest themselves of the academies and replace them with Institutes of Religion near college campuses. I trace the establishment of the first five institutes, illustrating how the movement evolved during its first decade, 1926-1936. This case study examines how at the local level the University of Idaho, in Moscow and Pocatello, the Utah State Agricultural College in Logan, the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, and the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, each reacted to the presence of the Institute. It examines how each Institute adapted to the socio-cultural context of each town and university.

Government-led Vocational Training System and its Lessons: In case of South Korea before the IMF Economic Crisis
Vocational training system for skilled workforce has been highlighted as one ofthe key driving forces of South Korea's economic development. South Korea is well known for adopting a government-led vocational training strategy to make sure the supply of a skilled workforce according to the 1st--7th five-year economic developmentplans. This paper examines the main features and developmental changes of this strategy from the 1960s to the 1990s and suggests a set of important lessons for the design and implementation of vocational training policies. Vocational training policy also was led by the government and complemented by private sector. By providing training program through the establishment of public training institutes, the government managed the supply of skills. While the government has consistently expanded and controlled the vocational training system for meeting the needs of industry, the principle system was the compulsory in-plant training system, in which itwas obligatory for large companies to provide training program for their workforce or alternatively contribute the training promotion fund. The initial stages of this system in the 1970s were considered as successful in terms of raising numbers of trainees withinindustry. However the numbers later fell dramatically in the 1980s after the government reformed its policy. Many employers resisted against the burden of training obligation and levy. Although there were still unsolved limitations of the government-led vocational training system, South Korean vocational training system before the 1997 IMF economic crisis has contributed systematically to the transformation of industry and to economic development.

Biology reflective assessment curriculum
Often students and educators view assessments as an obligation and finality for a unit. In the current climate of high-stakes testing and accountability, the balance of time, resources and emphasis on students' scores related to assessment have been slanted considerably toward the summative side. This tension between assessment for accountability and assessment to inform teaching strains instruction and educators' ability to use that information to design learning opportunities that help students develop deeper conceptual understanding. A substantive body of research indicates that formative and reflective assessment can significantly improve student learning. Biology Reflective Assessment Curriculum (BRAC) examines support provided for high school science students through assessment practices. This investigation incorporates the usage of reflective assessments as a guiding practice for differentiated instruction and student choice. Reflective assessment is a metacognitive strategy that promotes self- monitoring and evaluation. The goals of the curriculum are to promote self-efficacy and conceptual understanding in students learning biology through developing their metacognitive awareness. BRAC was implemented in a high school biology classroom. Data from assessments, metacognitive surveys, self-efficacy surveys, reflective journals, student work, a culminating task and field notes were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the curriculum. The results suggest that students who develop their metacognitive skills developed a deeper conceptual understanding and improved feelings of self-efficacy when they were engaged in a reflective assessment unit embedded with student choice. BRAC is a tool for teachers to use assessments to assist students in becoming metacognitive and to guide student choice in learning opportunities

Robert B. Stevens: UCSC Chancellorship, 1987-1991
The Regional History Project conducted six interviews with UCSC Chancellor Robert B. Stevens during June and July, 1991. Stevens was appointed the campus's fifth chancellor by UC President David P. Gardner in July 1987, and served until July 1991. He was the second UCSC chancellor (following Chancellor Emeritus Robert L. Sinsheimer) recruited from a private institution.
      Stevens was born in England in 1933 and first came to the United States when he was 23. He was educated at Oxford University (B.A., M.A., B.C.L., and D.C.L.) and at Yale University (L.L.M.) and became an American citizen in 1971. An English barrister, Stevens has strong research interests in legal history and education in the United States and England. He served as chairman of the Research Advisory Committee of the American Bar Foundation, has written a half dozen books on legal history and social legislation, and numerous papers on American legal scholarship and comparative Anglo-American legal history.
      Prior to his appointment at UCSC he served for almost a decade as president of Haverford College from 1978 until 1987. From 1959 to 1976 he was a professor of law at Yale University. He served as provost and as professor of law and history at Tulane University from 1976 to 1978. He also taught at Oxford University, the London School of Economics, Stanford University, and the University of East Africa.
      Stevens begins his narrative by describing the circumstances surrounding his appointment, and his reasons for joining a public institution. His commitment to access-- that students from diverse ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds have an opportunity to attend a UC campus-- and to the undergraduate college system which characterizes this campus, were major motives in his decision to become chancellor.
      In these interviews he comments on the major policy areas which he addressed during his tenure, provides a critique of the institution as he found it, and explains the numerous changes he initiated. He describes the context for the strained nature of town-gown relations he faced upon his arrival and his efforts to establish a more harmonious relationship between the University and the city of Santa Cruz. His dilemma was to meet the obligations of the UC system in providing education for its students, while mitigating the impacts-- most notably, traffic congestion and housing-- which the growing campus student population had on the city. He describes the negotiations between city and campus officials which resulted in limiting the rate of growth and the size of the campus to 15,000 students, a precedent-setting agreement for a UC campus. He also discusses in detail the history of the Long Range Development Plan and the Report to the Committee on the Year 2005.
      Stevens speaks about the steps he took to decentralize the campus administration, to reinvigorate and reorganize the workings of the college system, and to establish a comprehensive budget process. These reforms stood the campus in good stead in light of the severe budget cuts which affected UCSC and the entire UC system during the state's recession.
      He discusses the many issues which engaged him during his tenure, including multiculturalism and the undergraduate curriculum, faculty teaching loads, his evaluation of the various academic disciplines and their faculties, his administrative appointments, and his efforts at fundraising and development. He also describes his relations with students, his thoughts on student activism, the development of the performing arts complex, and how his official social life was an opportunity for outreach to constituencies on the campus and in the community.
      Stevens recounts how he and his staff followed the campus emergency plan during the Loma Prieta Earthquake of October 17, 1989, when the campus suffered some $7 million dollars in damage, but fortunately no loss of life. When UCLA sent police and medical personnel to assist UCSC, Stevens saw that these resources were directed to the city and county of Santa Cruz in his efforts to be a good neighbor during this devastating period for the community.
      He described these interviews, held several weeks before he retired from the chancellorship, as a sort of de-briefing opportunity to reflect on his tenure. Stevens was unusually candid in assessing his chancellorship, freely acknowledging what he perceived as several missteps on his part as he came to better understand the culture of UCSC as a public institution.

Perspectives on instructor modeling in mathematics teacher education
Teachers' instructional practices are greatly shaped by their own learning experiences as students in K-12 and college classrooms, which for most teachers was traditional, teacher-centered instruction. One of the challenges facing mathematics education reform is that, traditional teaching is in contrast to reform student- centered instruction. If teachers learn from their experiences as mathematics students, mathematics teacher educators are encouraged to model practices they would like teachers to use. In this study I examined the implications of instructor modeling in mathematics teacher education courses. More specifically, I investigated what practicing teachers gained from mathematics teacher educators' modeling in mathematics teacher education courses. My questions were: (1) What do mathematics teacher educators believe they model about effective instructional practice? (2) What do practicing teachers notice about the mathematics teacher educators' pedagogy and identify as effective mathematics teaching? (3) In what ways do these perspectives align in mathematics courses for practicing teachers? I drew upon three-step- design methodology with stimulated recall interviews and complementary accounts methodology to explicate three mathematics teacher educators' reports of the ways they model teaching practice. I utilized these methodologies to analyze the researcher's, and the practicing teachers' perspectives on the mathematics teacher educators' instruction. In general the mathematics teacher educators and practicing teachers reported that the mathematics teacher educator modeled student-centered instruction as conveyed in the NCTM Professional Standards for Teaching Mathematics (1991), but also facets of the collaborative work of teachers outside of the classroom. This work outside of the classroom might include teachers collaboratively planning instruction, reflecting on practice, creating and reflecting on new practices, and supporting one another's professional growth. This research informs the body of knowledge about teaching the practice of teaching mathematics in two ways. First, it highlights how explicit discussion about mathematics teaching and implicit modeling of instruction supports practicing teachers' noticing of the instruction they experience. And second, this research points to how engaging in facets of the teaching profession that take place outside of their interactions with students has the potential to foster the enculturation of teachers into a professional learning community of mathematics teachers

Corrupting  Learning: Evidence From Missing Federal Education Funds in Brazil
This paper examines if money matters in education by looking at whether missing resources due to corruption affect student outcomes. We use data from the auditing of Brazil’s local governments to construct objective measures of corruption involving educational block grants transferred from the central government to municipalities. Using variation in the incidence of corruption across municipalities and controlling for student, school, and municipal characteristics, we find a significant negative association between corruption and the school performance of primary school students. Students residing in municipalities where corruption in education was detected score 0.35 standard deviations less on standardized tests, and have significantly higher dropout and failure rates. Using a rich dataset of school infrastructure and teacher and principal questionnaires, we also find that school inputs such as computer labs, teaching supplies, and teacher training are reduced in the presence of corruption. Overall, our findings suggest that in environments where basic schooling resources are lacking, money does matter for student achievement.

Low-Level Haskell Code: Measurements and Optimization Techniques
Haskell is a lazy functional language with a strong static type system and
  excellent support for parallel programming. The language features of Haskell
  make it easier to write correct and maintainable programs, but execution speed
  often suffers from the high levels of abstraction. While much past research
  focuses on high-level optimizations that take advantage of the functional
  properties of Haskell, relatively little attention has been paid to the
  optimization opportunities in the low-level imperative code generated during
  translation to machine code. One problem with current low-level optimizations
  is that their effectiveness is limited by the obscured control flow caused by
  Haskell's high-level abstractions. My thesis is that trace-based optimization
  techniques can be used to improve the effectiveness of low-level optimizations
  for Haskell programs. I claim three unique contributions in this work.

  The first contribution is to expose some properties of low-level Haskell codes
  by looking at the mix of operations performed by the selected benchmark codes
  and comparing them to the low-level codes coming from traditional programming
  languages. The low-level measurements reveal that the control flow is obscured
  by indirect jumps caused by the implementation of lazy evaluation,
  higher-order functions, and the separately managed stacks used by Haskell
  programs.

  My second contribution is a study on the effectiveness of a dynamic binary
  trace-based optimizer running on Haskell programs. My results show that while
  viable program traces frequently occur in Haskell programs the overhead
  associated with maintaing the traces in a dynamic optimization system outweigh
  the benefits we get from running the traces. To reduce the runtime overheads,
  I explore a way to find traces in a separate profiling step.
  
  My final contribution is to build and evaluate a static trace-based optimizer
  for Haskell programs. The static optimizer uses profiling data to find traces
  in a Haskell program and then restructures the code around the traces to
  increase the scope available to the low-level optimizer. My results show that
  we can successfully build traces in Haskell programs, and the optimized code
  yields a speedup over existing low-level optimizers of up to 86%
  with an average speedup of 5% across 32 benchmarks.

Aspirations, Barriers, and Transfer Opportunities for  Latina and Latino Community College Students
The majority of California's students seeking higher education are enrolled in a community college and approximately a third are Latino. Yet as the number of Latinos in community colleges has risen, their degree completion and transfer rates lag in comparison to other major ethnic groups. To investigate the academic aspirations and barriers of community college students, this mixed-methods case study focused on Latinos in a specialized learning community for students entering their first year. This research employed pre and post surveys among approximately 280 students enrolled in a first year learning community at a large urban community college in Southern California. Interviews were conducted with thirty-one students who were enrolled and successfully completed courses in the first year learning community. Additional students were interviewed who had previously been affiliated with the learning community but did not successfully complete their courses and were no longer enrolled. Interviews were also conducted with students who had successfully completed their second year at the community college and were employed in the specialized learning community as a Peer Assistant. Findings demonstrate that students held greater aspirations to transfer than to complete an Associate or Vocational degree. The majority of participants from all student cohorts expressed aspirations to transfer to a public university. Although the surveys and interviews provided insight into students' aspirations, the cohort of first year students appeared to lack specific knowledge about which academic pathway led to their desired degree or career. These students all reported complex barriers in balancing financial and personal responsibilities with their academic workload.  Students who had participated in the matriculation process and received early academic planning through the learning community programming held more realistic perceived timelines to transfer, highlighting the importance of early access to counselors and academic planning to help students' overcome institutional barriers. The majority of participants struggled to reach college transferable "gatekeeper" courses, where most students were placed in developmental English and Mathematics courses in their first semester.  The study concludes with recommendations for future research and improved practices to address the high aspirations towards transfer and barriers that students face at community colleges.

<p>Abstract: This article deploys poststructuralist discourse theory to examine ideological influences in tourism higher education in England. It foregrounds neoliberalism and managerialism circulating from government policy to higher education institutions and illustrates how the notions of competition, markets, performativity and quality assurance, commonly associated with industry and commerce, converge in tourism higher education. It highlights the role of power in mediating the relationship between tourism higher education and other institutions responsible for producing and disseminating the texts analyzed. It points to the discursive construction of tourism higher education in England and concludes by posing the question: to what extent has this state of affairs contributed to furthering its venerability within the broader higher education academe?

Discipline Policies, Successful Schools, and Racial Justice
This research makes clear that unnecessarily harsh discipline policies are applied unfairly and disproportionately to minority students, dragging down academic achievement. The report documents a trend across the United States in which minority students routinely receive major penalties, including school suspensions, for minor school offenses. The materials also show how criminalizing kids detrimentally affects student learning, and criticizes the federal government’s minimal efforts to collect data in any uniform way on the large number of students kicked out of school.

Training Interpersonal Skills for Interviews: The Value of Behavioral Models and the Role of Personality
Training for interpersonal skills is used widely in organizations but few empirical studies have measured its effectiveness in creating behavioral change. Though the impact of individual differences on training for technical skills has been examined extensively, prior studies in interpersonal skills training have not investigated personal characteristics to determine antecedents of interpersonal knowledge and predictors of learning. The current investigation applies social learning theory to the development of interpersonal skills training for job interviewing and examines the role of personality on training outcomes. In Study 1, I analyzed the interpersonal skills relevant to interviewing for a job and developed a measure of interpersonal interview knowledge. In Study 2, I investigated two formats for training interpersonal skills for interviews. One format used general rules for behavior to teach interpersonal skills for interviews while the other format used a combination of rules and examples of real interview behaviors modeled by actors. The primary aim of Study 2 was to examine the relationships between personality, training format, training’s fit with self-concept, knowledge, and interview performance. Training format did not impact interpersonal interview knowledge but did influence satisfaction with the training. Surprisingly, cognitive ability was not related to interview knowledge before or after training. Agreeableness and conscientiousness were positively related interpersonal interview knowledge. Interpersonal interview knowledge and conscientiousness positively predicted interview performance. Agreeableness, however, was negatively related to interview performance. These findings begin to answer questions about how individual differences can impact the effectiveness of interpersonal skills training in terms of both knowledge development and transfer of skills to job-related contexts.

Navigating the fruit fly brain : visual place learning in Drosophila melanogaster
How does an animal know where it is, and where it is going? While the impressive navigation abilities of ants, bees, wasps, and other insects clearly demonstrate that insects are capable of visual place learning, little is known about the underlying neural circuits that mediate these behaviors. Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful model organism for dissecting the neural circuitry underlying complex behaviors, from sensory perception to learning and memory. Flies can identify and remember visual features such as size, color, and contour orientation. However, the extent to which they use vision to navigate and recall specific locations remains unclear. In this dissertation, I will : 1) describe the development of a novel place learning assay for investigating spatial memories in Drosophila ; 2) present evidence that fruit flies are capable of forming and recalling spatial memories ; 3) demonstrate that neurons in the central complex are necessary for visual place learning and 4) show that silencing these cells specifically impairs place learning without affecting other sensory or motor systems. Together, these studies reveal distinct neuroanatomical substrates for spatial versus non-spatial learning, and substantiate Drosophila as a powerful model for the study of spatial memories

Memory Dynamics in Cross-Situational Statistical Learning
A central pursuit in cognitive science and developmental psychology has been to characterize how humans encode a seemingly infinite amount of information, interpret this information, and use the information at later points in time.  For example, in the domain of language learning and development, researchers have long sought to determine how infants and adults are able to determine word-referent pairings, despite the infinite number of possibilities (Quine, 1960).  More recent research has suggested that learners are able to determine word-referent pairings by tracking co-occurrence probabilities across time, a behavior commonly termed <italic>cross-situational statistical learning</italic>.     The current series of experiments built upon research on cross-situational statistical learning by examining learning over varying timescales, from a matter of seconds to up to one week.  In particular, this work examined the mechanisms underlying learning that promoted and/or deterred the learning and long-term retention of cross-situational statistics.  Experiments 1 - 3 presented adult learners with a cross-situational learning task and then presented learners with a forced-choice inference test immediately or one week later.  Experiments 2-3 examined how retrieval dynamics, the ease and/or difficulty of retrieving information while learning, was related to long-term retention and inference performance.  Experiment 4 presented infant learners with a cross-situational learning task that manipulated the timing at which word-referent pairings were presented, requiring infants to retrieve prior potential pairings from long-term memory.     The results of the these studies indicate that adult learners are able to retain cross-situational statistics for up to one week later and that the amount of retention is related to ease and/or difficulty of retrieval during the learning process.  However, young infants demonstrated constraints on their ability to retrieve information over short timescales, indicating that memory development in retrieval abilities may be critical to acquiring word-referent pairings.  This work challenges broad theories of cognition and development that rest on retrieval processes as successful and automatic.  Indeed, retrieving the past is a dynamic process, which undergoes dramatic developments over the lifespan, and should be incorporated into theoretical and computational accounts of learning.

Developing thoughtful world explorers : incorporating technology and active learning into a fifth-grade geography classroom
Although technology has rapidly created a more accessible world necessitating broader global understanding, geography knowledge has lagged far behind. Young students are becoming more familiar and comfortable with using technologies, such as computers, cell phones, and iPods; however, they are unable to locate sites of significant events that impact the world today. Virtually Traveling Europe (VTE) is an approach that addresses the need for improved geography understanding through incorporating technology in the classroom. VTE utilizes collaborative and active learning to engage students in a project-based curriculum. The ultimate goal of this approach is for students to gain an improved understanding of their place in the world and the relevance of geography to their lives. Additional goals include engaging students through technology, choice, collaboration, and authentic real- world applications of geography. In this study, students worked in groups to research a region of Europe using books, the internet, and Google Earth. Groups created a travel brochure with geographic, historical, cultural, and travel information about their European region, and the project culminated in student presentations about each group's region using Google Earth as a visual tool. VTE was implemented in a private school fifth-grade geography classroom. The data sources collected and analyzed included field notes, surveys, and student work. Evaluations of this data suggest that students were engaged in their study of Europe and that positive collaboration led to greater success. Google Earth had limitations as a research tool but great potential for presentations, and further studies into its classroom application are recommended

Economic impact of tax-based federal student aid
Tax-based federal student aid--the Hope Tax Credit, Lifetime Learning Tax Credit and Tuition Deduction--marks a new paradigm for federal aid by offering tax incentives for postsecondary enrollment aimed at the middle-class. In this dissertation, I examine how the programs impact postsecondary enrollment, how colleges and universities respond to the programs, and I explore how taxpayers who are limited to one program select among the three options. In the first Chapter, I exploit policy-induced variation in tax-based aid eligibility to estimate its casual effect on college enrollment. I find that tax-based aid increases full-time enrollment in the first two years of college for 18-19 year-olds by 2.2 percentage points (6.7 percent). Yet, the enrollment increase comes at a steep price. Between 7 and 13 inframarginal youths are subsidized for each marginal youth that is induced to enroll in college. In the second chapter, I explore how colleges and universities respond to tax- based federal student aid. I demonstrate the importance of benefit incidence analysis by showing that the intended cost reductions of tax-based federal student aid are substantially offset by institutional price increases. Contrary to the goal of policymakers, I find that tax-based aid crowds out institutional aid dollar-for-dollar. Unfortunately, it is not clear how institutions utilize these captured resources, so that the ultimate incidence of the programs is uncertain. In the third chapter, I show that roughly one in five taxpayers who are eligible for more than one tax-based federal student aid program, and who are limited to one program per student per year, select a program that offers a smaller reduction in combined federal and state tax liability. I offer three explanations for this pattern of tax-based aid selection, including salience in program value, tax evasion and inertia in program selection. Collectively, the results from these chapters suggest that the benefits of tax- based federal student aid have come at a heavy price. The modest postsecondary enrollment increase for middle-income youths is achieved via a substantial transfer to colleges and universities, while complexity in program rules introduces substantial frictions for taxpayers

California's Safe Routes to School Program: Impacts on Walking, Bicycling, and Pedestrian Safety
Safe Routes to School (SR2S) programs have generated tremendous interest among U.S. policymakers, planners, and public health officials in recent years. These programs target the walk to school as an essential point of intervention to improve pedestrian safety and increase physical activity among children. In this article, we evaluate California’s pioneering SR2S construction program, which was designed to improve safety for children’s walking and bicycling to school, and to increase the number of children who do so, by funding traffic engineering improvements around schools. Through a systematic evaluation of 10 California SR2S traffic improvement projects near elementary schools, we examined the impacts of this influential state policy on children’s travel behavior in these neighborhoods. We investigated changes in the perceived safety of children’s trips to school, in safety-related behaviors tied to the trip to school, and in the number of children walking and bicycling to school following these improvements. The findings have implications for California’s SR2S program and for similar initiatives throughout the country.

Policy in Practice: The Implementation of Structured English Immersion in Arizona
This study examines the implementation and organization of the state mandated curriculum in the 4-hour SEI block in 18 K-12 classrooms in 5 different districts. We focus on the effects of grouping by language proficiency, the delivery of the structure-based ESL curriculum, the provision of resources and limiting of access to grade-level curriculum, and problems of promotion and graduation for ELLs. In each of these areas, the implementation of the SEI 4- hour block raises concerns with regard to equal educational opportunity and access to English. Key among the findings of this study are: ELLs are physically, socially, and educationally isolated from their non-ELL peers; they are not exiting the program in one year, raising serious questions about the time these students must remain in these segregated settings; reclassification rates are a poor indicator of success in mainstream classrooms; and the four-hour model places ELLs at a severe disadvantage for high school graduation. The only means for these students to graduate with their peers appears to be through after school and summer school programs that either did not exist or had been cut.

      There are problems detailed in the survey responses, but they are not problems inherent in the goals or objectives of the plan. Instead, they are problems mostly associated with implementation of the new plan's changes in transportation.  In particular, these problems are significantly related to unreliable bus service and long bus rides experienced by a minority of families.

High Speed Rail in Japan: A Review and Evaluation of Megnetic Levitation Trains
This is one of a series of reports now being produced as the first output of our study of the potential for a high-speed passenger train service in California. Each report deals with a specific high-speed train technology; it attempts an evaluation, standardized as far as available data permit, of its technical and economic viability.
      Specifically, each report assesses the particular high-speed technology against a number of criteria:
      1. Technical Performance: configuration of roadbed in terms of gradients, curvature, and construction cost; power sources; capacity and speed; capacity to integrate with existing transportation facilities.
      2. Economic performance: traffic levels; revenues; financial appraisal and overall cost-benefit analysis; level of public subsidy required, if any.
      3. Resource consumption and environmental performance: type and amount of energy required; impact on non-renewable resources; environmental impact, including emissions, noise, visual intrusion and effect on local communities.
      The present series includes five studies. Two companion studies, on British Rail's InterCity 125 and 225 services and on Tilting Trains (the Italian Pendolino and the Swedish X-2000 service), will follow shortly. Thereafter, a systematic comparative analysis will be published.
      The CalSpeed study will continue with preliminary route alignments, also to be produced shortly, followed by market assessments, to be completed in Fall 1992. These will bring to a close the present phase of work, which will be the subject of an overall report also to be completed in Fall 1992.

Assessing Children's Exposure to Ultrafine Particles and Other Air Pollutants in School Buses and at Schools
Increasing evidence has demonstrated toxic effects of ultrafine particles (UFPs, diameter < 100 nm). Children are particularly at risk due to their immature respiratory systems and greater breathing rates per body weight. This study aims to assess children's exposure to UFPs and other air pollutants in school buses and at schools. 24 school buses were employed to represent commonly used school buses in the United States. UFPs and other air pollutants in and around school buses were measured while idling and driving on roadways. The performances of retrofit systems for diesel-power school buses, a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) muffler and a spiracle crankcase filtration system (CFS), were evaluated regarding UFP and other air pol lutants from tailpipe emissions and inside bus cabins. UFPs and other air pollutants was examined simultaneously inside and outside of different indoor microenvironments at five schools with different ventilation systems. When driving on roadways, the important factors for in-cabin total particle number concentrations included engine age, window position, driving speed, driving route, bus operation and passenger load. Idling increased total particle number concentration near the school buses under all scenarios, by a factor of up to 26.0. Depending on wind direction and window position, idling increased total particle number concentration inside the school buses by a factor of 1.3 - 2.9, with the majority occurring in the size range of 10-30 nm. Retrofit systems significantly reduced tailpipe emissions by 20% - 94% for total particle number concentration with both DOC and CFS installed. No unequivocal decrease was observed for in-cabin air pollutants after retrofitting. The AC/fan unit and the surrounding air played more important roles for determining in-cabin air quality than did retrofit technologies. The use of an air purifier was found to remove in-cabin particles by up to 50%. For the indoor microenvironments at schools, the most important factors affecting indoor total particle number concentration were related to various indoor sources. Without indoor sources, the indoor-to-outdoor (I/O) ratios for total particle number concentrations varied from 0.12 to 0.66 for the five ventilation systems studied. The I/O ratio decreased when the outdoor total particle number concentration increased.

Page Smith: Founding Cowell College and UCSC, 1964-1973
This oral history chronicles the late Page Smith's experiences as founding provost of the campus's first college and his major contributions in shaping the college system here. His narration includes chapters on student culture in the 1960s and 1970s, the pass/fail grading system, his educational philosophy, town/gown relations, campus architecture, the History of Consciousness Program, his relationship with founding Chancellor Dean E. McHenry, arts on the campus and the role of his wife, Eloise Pickard Smith, in the founding of the art gallery at Cowell College which now bears her name. The volume is a candid narration which conveys Smith's contrarian perspective on higher education and the flavor of the campus in its early pioneering years.
      Smith joined the faculty in 1964 and embarked on the adventure of creating a new UC campus. The formative concepts shaping UCSC were an emphasis on undergraduate teaching and the creation of small human-scale colleges around which campus intellectual and cultural life would be organized. Smith became deeply involved in creating a close-knit community at Cowell College, and in promoting a number of innovations during the campus's first decade, perhaps the most significant of which was the narrative evaluation or pass/fail system, an abandonment of the old letter grade system.
      Smith's interviews are organized into three sections. The first includes Smith's commentary on his controversial appointment as the campus's first provost, early faculty appointments, his efforts to recruit women and minority faculty, and college life. In the second section he discusses issues he confronted as provost, administering Cowell College, establishing the pass/fail grading system, his teaching and curriculum philosophy, the conflict between boards of studies (now designated as departments), and how he defined the provost's role. In the final section, "UCSC's Development", Smith discusses campus-wide topics, including his relationship with founding Chancellor Dean E. McHenry, his opinion of campus architecture, the origins of the History of Consciousness program, and town-gown relations. He also discusses the role of his wife, the late artist, Eloise Pickard Smith, in the founding of the art gallery at Cowell College that now bears her name.
      In the final chapters of the volume, Smith candidly discusses his resignation from the University in 1973 after his colleague and friend, Paul Lee, a professor of religious studies, was not given tenure. Smith used this occasion as a symbolic protest against what he considered the rigidity of the "publish or perish" system governing University faculty promotion and tenure. This issue was a major and paradoxical bete noire in Smith's attitude towards academic life since he himself was uncommonly prolific and published over two dozen books. His Killing the Spirit: Higher Education in America (1990) provided an elaborate critique of contemporary academic life.
      Smith's legacy lives on in his scholarly work, which he continued after his retirement from the University, with numerous publications, including the 8-volume People's History of the United States, in his many contributions to UCSC and Cowell College, and in his untiring work as a community activist on behalf of the homeless. He was a co-founder (with his friend Paul Lee) of the William James Association in Santa Cruz, the Homeless Garden Project, the Penny University and the Prison Arts Project.

Eco Passes: An Evaluation of Employer-Based Transit Programs
Transit agencies have found a new way to increase ridership: offer Eco Pass programs that cater to specific user groups. In these programs, a transit agency sells to groups the right for all of their members to ride public transit without paying a fare. Because all members of the group can ride free, they ride public transit more often. These Eco Pass programs have been developed for universities, workplaces, and the home. Previous research has examined university programs, and has shown that they increase transit ridership, reduce vehicle travel, and reduce parking demand. The largest potential Eco Pass market is for workplace transit programs, but there have been few studies of these programs. This research examines the cost-effectiveness of workplace transit-pass programs. It explains how the programs work, examines the programs’ effects on employee transit ridership and parking demand, calculates the programs’ cost-effectiveness, and recommends that cities should reduce the parking requirements at sites that provide Eco Pass programs. A study of Eco Passes in the Silicon Valley found that an employer who spends $1 a year to provide Eco Passes for employees can save between $46 and $1,938 on the capital cost of providing the parking spaces required for commuters. In-lieu Eco Passes appear to be an excellent investment.

Meaning making in a college mathematics lecture format : the intersection of mathematics, language, and cultural meaning systems
Students and teachers use language to communicate mathematical knowledge and understanding. This communication is compounded by the underlying requirement for students to acquire language with specialized meaning and to have facility with this meaning as a member of a mathematics discourse community. The lecture format is a long-standing means of communicating knowledge in the university mathematics classroom. Instructors and students approach the mathematics classroom with cultural meaning systems that contain diverse and divergent assumptions, histories, personalities, and social and cultural norms. The instructor assembles a lecture from a perspective that includes a deep understanding of mathematics that may not match the perspective and mathematical knowledge of the student audience. Given the multiple and complex concepts in mathematics, assigning a precise meaning can be difficult for students, producing a high likelihood that connotation, implication, and relevance can be confused. Even with precise mathematical definitions, students' interpretation of the meaning of a definition being taught is very much dependent on the precision with which the student assigns connotation, implication, and relevance to each symbol, picture, metaphor and word within the framework of the definition. This study examines the question of how students assign meaning to terms in the mathematics register and how these assigned meanings determine the ways in which students understand mathematical concepts. The students in this study are drawn from a college-level remedial mathematics course. The depth of students' pre-existing knowledge of mathematics determined the complexity and breadth of their current meaning-making. The students' use of language and meaning in an "everyday" context influenced the ways meaning was assigned to terms in the mathematics register and the lack of precision in understanding and assigning mathematical meanings. The subtle variations in meanings and the seemingly reasonable connections students made to arrive at these meanings suggests instructors need to take cultural meanings that students bring to the classroom into account when teaching the mathematics course. Instructional planning should include ways for instructors to decipher previous student meaning-making about and understanding of mathematical concepts in order to correct students' misunderstandings and to help students develop more precise meanings assigned to terminology and concepts.

Academic Knowledge Transfer in Social Networks
The rise of online social networks has presented many new opportunities and meth- ods for human communication in general and academic communication in particular. Knowledge is created at every level of academia, including individuals, project groups, and research communities. For knowledge to have lasting utility, it must be transferred from one mind to another, for only when knowledge is instantiated in someone's mind can it be used as the base for future action and thought. Today, despite decades of re- search, computer support for knowledge workers in academia is fragmented and poorly integrated. While office automation and other forms of CSCW approaches have ben- efitted academics, no single environment today integrates the basic research activities of the academic knowledge worker, including: individually or collaboratively writing re- search papers, sharing research papers, reviewing papers for publication in a journal or conference and persistently sharing comments and observations on existing literature.This thesis explores academic knowledge transfer within social networks in several ways. It first presents a model of academic knowledge transfer, along with the requirements for a software system that instantiates that model. The proof-of- concept, named Whisper, for that software system is described, along with the feedback from its users and the changes made to the system's design based on that feedback.Additionally, an experiment in gamification of knowledge transfer within the Facebook social network is explored, with implications for the knowledge transfer system design. Finally, data from celebrity users and regular users of the Twitter social network is contrasted, providing insight into how often information from the different types of users is re-shared to others, how the "packaging" of that information (a simple statement vs a link to a website) affects the re-sharing rate, and methods users might try to increase the depth their messages can reach in the Twitter network.Academics currently have very poor tool support for some of the most common tasks they perform, such as organizing the files (both data and research output) across software applications, and linking research output back to the raw data. Both of these concerns, and others, would be addressed by a knowledge sharing environment based on the model described here. The full development of such a system presents additional opportunities for research in human factors, CSCW, and social psychology.

Public School Desegregation in the United States, 1968 - 1980
It is now more that fourteen years since the Supreme Court rejected gradual and voluntary transfers between black and white schools and called for root-and-branch desegregation. Almost a decade has passed since the first Supreme Court decision requiring citywide bussing outside the South. But the national debate over school desegregation continues to be intense. We are experiencing another national attack on court-ordered desegregation by national leaders, including the president and attorney general. The federal grant program supporting desegregation was repealed in 1981 and there are numerous proposals in Congress to limit the use of bussing for desegregation. At the same time, in courtrooms across the country, civil rights groups continue to wage protracted legal battles against segregation.

Moving from the utterances of students into action : a phenomenological exploration of students' perceptions of teacher behaviors
The purpose of this study is to examine how students' perceptions of teachers' behaviors impacts their success in school. This study stems from the achievement gap noticed in students of color or in situations that place them at risk of dropping out of school. In order to explore the achievement gap, much prior research has relied on statistical data taken from adults or outside agencies. These sources often negate the voice of the students that make up these gaps. This study will examine students' perceptions and connections to perceptions and student success in the classroom. The literature reviewed in this case study examines (1) the achievement gap as a phenomenon, (2) students' perspectives, and (3) student voice. An examination of these areas of literature provides substantive support for research needed in the area of the impact of students' perspectives on their academic achievement. Participants in this study include 30 11th- and 12th-grade students attending an alternative high school in south Riverside County, California. Data for this research will be collected through student surveys, interviews, and student writing samples. A modified method of analysis of phenomenological data was used to analyze, group, and derive themes from the data provided from participants' responses. Research findings are presented in this study to inform present and future educators about ways to reach student groups that are most at risk of failing in school

To help ensure  quality program delivery, effective professional development for adult  volunteers who serve as 4-H science educators is essential. Lesson  study, a constructivist-based professional development model, is one  potential strategy to help meet this need. A sequential explanatory  mixed-methods design was used to investigate the influence of lesson  study on 4-H volunteers' science content and pedagogical knowledge. In  mixed-methods research, both quantitative and qualitative data are  collected and analyzed in an investigation. Survey data revealed  improved understanding and use of subject matter knowledge among  participants. Focus group interview data elaborated on participants'  understanding and use of inquiry processes. Results from this study  could benefit 4-H volunteers, other nonformal educators, and  researchers.

Multimedia Education Increases Elder Knowledge of Emergency Department
 Introduction:Elders who utilize the emergency department (ED) may have little prospective knowledge of appropriate expectations during an ED encounter. Improving elder orientation to ED expectations is important for satisfaction and health education. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a multi-media education intervention as a method for informing independently living elders about ED care. The program delivered messages categorically as, the number of tests, providers, decisions and disposition decision making.
      Methods:Interventional trial of representative elders over 59 years of age comparing pre and post multimedia program exposure. A brief (0.3 hour) video that chronicled the key events after a hypothetical 911 call for chest pain was shown. The video used a clinical narrator, 15 ED health care providers, and 2 professional actors for the patient and spouse. Pre- and post-video tests results were obtained with audience response technology (ART) assessed learning using a 4 point Likert scale.
      Results:Valid data from 142 participants were analyzed pre to post rankings (Wilcoxon signed-rank tests). The following four learning objectives showed significant improvements: number of tests expected median differences on a 4-point Likert scale with 95% confidence intervals: 0.50 (0.00, 1.00); number of providers expected 1.0 (1.00, 1.50); communications 1.0 (1.00, 1.50); and pre-hospital medical treatment 0.50 (0.00, 1.00). Elders (96%) judged the intervention as improving their ability to cope with an ED encounter.
      Conclusion:A short video with graphic side-bar information is an effective educational strategy to improve elder understanding of expectations during a hypothetical ED encounter following calling 911. West J Emerg Med.

Nurse-Physician Teamwork in the Emergency Department
Background: Teamwork gained momentum in the 1980s. Research studies in the military and aviation demonstrated that teamwork is essential to safety. There were limited studies dealing with the practice of teamwork between nurses and physicians in the Emergence Departments (EDs).  Aims: Descriptive aim of the study was to examine differences between staff in the Interventional and Control Groups on perception of staff teamwork. The exploratory aim was to examine staff perception of job satisfaction, work environment, autonomy, and control over practice.  Design: The Interventional Group comprised four EDs that participated in teamwork training and operationalized its principles in their EDs. Control Group EDs comprised four EDs which did not participate in the training. Survey questionnaires were used for data collection. Setting and Participants: Staff from four Interventional and four Control Group EDs throughout California participated in the study. There were 191 participants from the Interventional Group EDs and 307 from the Control Group EDs. Main Outcome Measures: Differences between staff who worked in the Interventional Group EDs and staff who worked in the Control Group EDs on perception of teamwork, job satisfaction, work environment, autonomy, and control over practice were assessed. Results: Staff who worked  in the Interventional Group EDs showed significant differences compared with staff who worked in the Control Group EDs on staff perception of teamwork (p = 0.006), job satisfaction (p < 0.0001), work environment (p = 0.006), autonomy (p < 0.0001), and control over practice (p < 0.0001). There were no significant differences in satisfaction with care received by patients who received care in the interventional group EDs compared with those who received care in the control group EDs. Data on medical and non-medical errors were not collected due to lack of willingness to give approval by potential participating hospitals. Conclusion: Active teamwork practice between nurses and physicians in the EDs appeared to be associated with increased job satisfaction, perception of work environment, autonomy, and control over practice of both nurses and physicians who worked in the Interventional Group over those who worked in the Control Group EDs.

Neoliberal Education Reforms and Debates around Neoliberalism: Finance-driven Reforms in Chilean Higher Education
This paper is a means of exploring how neoliberal education reforms have been implemented and what issues remain in education development as a product of those reforms. To examine neoliberal education reforms, this paper explores how international organizations such as the World Bank and international discourses in the international community influence education development and require developing countries to implement neoliberal reforms. I look to the work of Martin Carnoy (1995) "Structural adjustment and the changing face of education," which categorizes the responses to neoliberal education reforms: competitiveness-driven reform, equity-driven reform, and financial-driven reform, as the theoretical framework. Chilean higher education reforms are analyzed as a case study. The paper concludes that neoliberal education reforms expanded the number of higher education institutions and achieve efficiency and effectiveness in higher education; however, public universities have lost their autonomy and access inequity and quality assurance of higher education have been remained.

Precursors of Professionalism in Senior-level Undergraduate Business Students
Understanding the professional identity of senior-level undergraduate business students may shed light on the rampant unethical acts of business managers in industry.  Business education is the largest segment of undergraduate majors, constituting more than 20% of students in four-year institutions, year after year.  To explain the professional identity of business students, this study uses prior theoretical frameworks to model the precursors of professionalism--"autonomy of judgment," "desire for expertise," "self-concept," and "social agency."  The study draws on data from the College Senior Survey (CSS) collected by the Higher Education Research Institute (HERI) at UCLA for two academic years 2006-2008.  Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis indicate that the four factors--autonomy of judgment, desire for expertise, self-concept, and social agency--indeed fit a cohesive model for the latent construct "precursors of professionalism."  The results suggest that there are statistically significant differences between business and non-business majors for three of the four factors tested in the study: "desire for expertise," "self-concept," and "social agency."  This indicates that business students differ from their peers in college in most of the dimensions of the precursors of professionalism.

Karl S. Pister: UCSC Chancellorship, 1991-1996
Pister's recollections of his tenure as the campus's sixth chancellor include his perspectives on a number of issues his administration faced: the recession-caused budget cuts UCSC absorbed, the UC Regents' controversial decision regarding affirmative action, the state of town-gown relations upon his arrival at UCSC in 1991, and controversies surrounding construction projects on campus.
      The oral history, entitled Karl S. Pister, UCSC Chancellorship, 1991- 1996, was transcribed and edited from interviews conducted by UCSC Regional Historian Randall Jarrell.
      Born in Stockton, California, Pister received his B.S. (1945) and M.S. degrees (1948) in civil engineering at UC Berkeley. In 1952 he received his Ph.D. from the University of Illinois in theoretical and applied mechanics.
      Prior to his tenure at UCSC, Pister had spent 30 years at UC Berkeley as a faculty member and 15 years there as an academic administrator. He began his career at Berkeley as a lecturer in 1947; in 1952, he joined the faculty of the campus's College of Engineering, where he had a distinguished career as a professor of engineering. He served as dean of the college from 1980 until 1990.
      In his narration, Pister describes a number of institutional conflicts he encountered early in his tenure as UCSC chancellor, and he discusses his efforts to reconcile UCSC's unique college system and emphasis on undergraduate education with the university's research mission.
      He also described controversies over campus building projects-- the founding of Colleges Nine and Ten and a music/performing arts complex-- and efforts that his administration made to improve UCSC's capital planning process.
      Pister also discusses the severe budget cuts, occurring during his tenure, that had a significant impact on campus academic programs and future planning. He describes a collaborative budget process that he said helped the campus weather those budget storms, while at the same time maintaining faculty, staff, and student morale during a difficult period in the campus's history.
      In the oral history, Pister also describes the difficult state of town-gown relations that he faced upon his arrival at UCSC. Pister believes he succeeded in toning down the rhetoric and establishing cordial relations with the city and county of Santa Cruz, ushering in a new era of cooperation.
      Throughout his tenure as chancellor, Pister was a tireless advocate for university involvement in the effort to improve K-12 education in the region, and he describes UCSC's role in the Monterey Bay Educational Consortium, which has fostered collaboration between the campus and public schools. He also describes his effort to expand UCSC's outreach to the region's 13 community colleges, as well as the Leadership Opportunity Awards scholarship program he instituted that assists community college students transferring to UCSC.
      The narrative also includes Pister's detailed commentary on UCSC's admissions strategies subsequent to the outlawing of affirmative action by the UC Regents. He describes the role he played in joining with other UC chancellors to issue a unanimous public statement opposing the board's decision.

Enhancing SMTEs Business performance through the Internet and eLearning Platforms
<p>Online learning (eLearning) systems can help to deliver ICT training to Small and medium-sized tourist enterprises (SMTEs). SMTEs need to maintain and understand the importance of utilising new information technologies dynamically and to incorporate training and education into their overall strategy via online learning. They need to be innovative and adopt systems that will allow them to explore their potential. 

</p>
<p>This paper investigates SMTEs in the European Hotel sector and their utilisation of the Internet and their perception on online learning systems. The paper also aims to demonstrate to SMTEs that training is imperative and that ICTs can enable them to improve their inventory management, strengthen their marketing and communications strategies and develop their internal business processes.  The paper demonstrates that a course on ICT skills can assist SMTEs to further their development. The survey demonstrates that SMTEs are not utilising Information technology in their business to its full potential. They primarily see the Internet as a mechanism for promoting their hotel rather than for training, inter- intra-organisational and eCommerce purposes. Respondents have recognised that integrating technology with training will become a management challenge in the future, but at present it is not considered a priority for many SMTEs. However respondents did identify their highest preference for content to be incorporated into the online course modules to be ICT trends and issues. Therefore it can be concluded that SMTEs are willing to engage in online learning and that the ability of SMTEs in embracing eLearning which can become crucial determinants of their success.</p>

Integrating local agriculture into nutrition programs can benefit children's health
Childhood obesity has multiple interrelated causes and so should be  addressed with multiple interventions, including innovative nutrition  education programs that encourage healthy lifestyle choices in children.  Research indicates that garden-based nutrition education increases  fruit and vegetable preferences and consumption in children.  Additionally, many reports on Farm to School programs indicate they  promote both increased consumption of fruits and vegetables and  participation in the National School Lunch Program. Within California,  UC Agriculture and Natural Resources plays a leadership role in school  garden and Farm to School programs. We provide a relevant literature  review and assess the role of UC Cooperative Extension (UCCE) in program  implementation and assessment, including results from a survey of UCCE  advisors and directors. All respondents reported implementation of  garden-based nutrition education and Farm to School programs; however,  evaluation occurred much less frequently.

Factors Influencing Emergency Department Preference for Access to Healthcare
Introduction:African-Americans are more likely than Caucasians to access healthcare through the emergency department (ED); however, the reasons behind this pattern are unclear. The objective isto investigate the effect of race, insurance, socioeconomic status, and perceived health on the preference for ED use.
      Methods:This is a prospective study at a tertiary care ED from June to July 2009. Patients were surveyed to capture demographics, healthcare utilization, and baseline health status. The primary outcome of interest was patient-reported routine place of healthcare. Other outcomes included frequency of ED visits in the previous 6 months, barriers to primary care and patient perception of health using select questions from the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36).
      Results:Two hundred and ninety-twopatients completed the survey of whom 58% were African-American and 44% were uninsured. African-Americans were equally likely to report 3 or more visits to the ED, but more likely to state a preference for the ED for their usual place of care (24% vs. 13%, p < 0.01). No significant differences between groups were found for barriers to primary care, including insurance. African-Americans less often reported comorbidities or hospitalization within the previous 6 months (23% vs. 34%, p = 0.04). On logistic regression modeling, African-Americans were more than 2 times as likely to select the ED as their usual place of healthcare (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.22 - 4.08). 
      Conclusion:African-Americans, independent of health insurance, are more likely than Caucasians to designate the ED as their routine place of healthcare. West J Emerg Med 0000; 00(0)00-00.

Using Mentor-Coaching to Refine Instructional Supervision Skills of  Developing Principals
The current student achievement gap can be attributed, in part, to theperceived and actual shortage of highly qualified principals prepared to be effective instructional leaders (Kearney, 2010).  Most school districts within do not offer consistent targeted professional development programs for mid-career principals that will develop principals' skills in the supervision of instruction.  This study was designed to examine how a mentor-coaching model could impact mid career principals in the refinement of supervision skills.	This qualitative Action Research study examines the impact that mentor-coaching strategies have on refining the instructional supervision skills of Developing (mid-career) Principals.  Five Mentor Coach Principals used Blended Coaching strategies to mentor and coach 10 Developing Principals. Qualitative data collected from journals, interviews, focus groups, questionnaires and open-ended surveys was used to measure the impact that Mentor-Coaches had on the Developing Principals when they worked with their teachers during pre and post lesson observation conferences.   Mentor-coach and Developing principals perceived that active listening, asking probing questions, providing immediate actionable feedback to teachers, following the conventions of the clinical supervision model, establishing a focused lens for lesson observation, and developing trusting relationships are integral elements having the greatest impact on the supervision of instruction.

Topics in Microeconometrics: Estimation of a Dynamic Model of Occupational Transitions, Wage and Non-Wage Benefits Cross Validation Bandwidth Selection for Derivatives of Various Dimensional Densities Testing the Additive Separability of the Teacher Value Added Effect Semiparametrically
I study three separate questions in this dissertation. In Chapter 1, I develop and estimate a structural dynamic model of occupation and job choice to test hypotheses of the importance of wages and non-wages and learning in occupational transitions, and find that wages are approximately 3 times as important as non-wage benefits in decisions and that workers will pay 70 cents of their hourly wage to avoid the uncertainty surrounding occupational choice. Chapter 2 develops and tests criteria for cross-validation bandwidth selection for derivatives of multidimensional densities; for conditional density, joint estimation of the numerator and denominator bandwidths performs best. Chapter 3 tests the additive separability of the teacher effect assumption common in the teacher value added models using data from the Los Angeles Unified School District, and finds that interacting the teacher indicator variables with a function of the students' lagged test scores captures most of the nonlinearities, preserves the heterogeneity of teacher effects, and provides more accurate estimates.

Meeting information literacy outcomes: Partnering with faculty to create effective information literacy assessment
This paper outlines the attempt by librarians at California State University Channel Islands (CI) to authentically assess the information literacy levels of first-year and third-year students, their partnership with faculty from CI’s writing and rhetoric programme in receiving a grant for this endeavour, the creation of a rubric and specialised assignment to facilitate the assessment process and the initial assessment data that came from the three-year grant period. Information gathered during our pilot study suggests that student information literacy proficiency levels can be determined by assessing student writing assignments, and that a targeted rubric is an effective authentic assessment measure in this endeavour. This study is of use to practising librarians as it highlights the efforts of the authors to partner with faculty, not only in assessing student papers, but also in creating a rubric and specialised bibliography assignment that can be used by librarians and faculty at their institutions.

Examining espoused and enacted theories about the cultivation of teacher leaders : a case study of a university's education department
Teacher leadership takes different forms and serves various important functions in bringing about and sustaining educational change. However, prior research suggests such leadership is difficult to cultivate. Most efforts to develop teachers' leadership abilities take place when teachers are already in the classroom. Teacher education programs may also play a key, yet seldom researched role. Using a theoretical lens of organizational learning, this research involved case study methods to examine the cultivation of teacher leaders at a teacher education program at a research university. The study examined the program's espoused theories of leadership, how those are enacted, and how they are experienced by students at different stages of their training. Thirty students at different stages in the program and five faculty were interviewed, and documents were also analyzed. An analysis of the data revealed that the structure of the coursework and the culture of the program cultivated by faculty helped to create students whose ideas and beliefs of teacher leadership roles grew and changed. Over time, students began to view themselves as future teacher leaders and change agents. Implications for theory and practice in teacher education are discussed

District-school leadership for organizational learning : finding the balance
No Child Left Behind (NCLB) set a challenging goal of 100% proficiency for all students, prompting schools and districts across the nation to implement major reform initiatives to meet increasing federal achievement targets. Some schools and a few districts have been successful, however, the majority are still failing. The primary purpose of this study is to identify and examine the role of one high achieving school district's central office in supporting or constraining learning initiatives of schools within the district. In particular, this study explores the informal and formal relationships and structures that foster collaboration between central office and school principals. Lastly, the study investigates the conditions and structures that allow leaders to be innovative and creative with the goal of increasing student achievement. To explore district/school relationships, this study drew on the theory and method of social network analysis, and its related and supporting theories of social and intellectual capital, and organizational learning. The concept underlying social network analysis is the more dense the relationships in an organization, the greater the potential for collaboration and creation of social capital. Collaborating, exchanging and combining knowledge among members leads to intellectual capital, which is essential for organizational learning. The research design of this study was a descriptive, embedded, single-case study that used quantitative extant data and qualitative methods to answer five main research questions. In addition to the social network analysis of central office/principal relations, a cross-case analysis of two embedded cohorts within one district was also conducted using evidence from surveys, semi-structured interviews, focus group interviews, and document analysis to examine how the district and schools worked together to negotiate, communicate, and implement reform initiatives. The study showed that there were dense networks of collaboration, communication, and innovation supported by high levels of trust among administrators at all levels. The qualitative data revealed that principals appreciated considerable autonomy to implement programs of their choice at the school site as long as they could show learning gains. Thus, the results presented a pattern of high levels of site-based decision-making autonomy coupled with high levels of accountability for student achievement - a finding not shown in most other studies of effective district reform. This district, serving a high percentage of English learners and socio-economically disadvantaged students, seems to have found a way to balance accountability with professionalism by focusing on student results rather than program mandates

Psychosocial learning environments and the mediating effect of personal meaning upon satisfaction with education
A mixed methods study was conducted to investigate the relationships between psychosocial learning environments and student satisfaction with their education as mediated by Agentic Personal Meaning. The interdisciplinary approach of the study integrated the fields of Learning Environment Research (LER), Existential Meaning Research (EMR), and Positive Psychology Research (PPR). A review of the literature within each field is provided. The mixed methods study included a quantitative phase in which a postulated model was tested using structural equation modeling to determine goodness-to-fit with data obtained from secondary and college level students in two progressive private schools in India. Findings indicate that the learning environment variables, Teacher Support, Task Orientation, Cooperation, Student Cohesiveness, Involvement, and Equity were significantly correlated with student Satisfaction with Education and with Agentic Personal Meaning. Findings also provide evidence that existential meaning and life-purpose mediates the relationships between the psychosocial learning environment variables, Teacher Support, Task Orientation, and Cooperation, and the outcome variable, student Satisfaction with Education. A qualitative phase explored through focus group interviews of school leaders and teachers how they foster meaning and purpose in the lives of their students. The data indicated that deep interpersonal relationships between students and teachers, freedom and opportunities for students to explore their interests through a wide variety of co-curricular activities, and an intention among teachers to expressly inspire students to become conscious, all taking place within a strong community context, serves to promote the development of meaning and purpose in the lives of students

Personal science teaching efficacy and the beliefs and practices of elementary teachers related to science instruction
In this study, I examined the relationships among Personal Science Teaching Efficacy (PSTE) beliefs, science teaching practices, and the beliefs about these practices within a nationwide diverse sample of inservice elementary teachers. More specifically, the goal of my study was to answer two questions: (1) How do these teachers with varying levels of self-efficacy compare in the ways that they (a) describe how science should be taught, (b) describe their own science teaching practices, and (c) are actually observed teaching science?; and (2) In what ways are these areas of belief and practice aligned?. In order to answer these questions, data were collected from thirty -eight inservice elementary teachers from across the United States using the Reformed Teacher Observation Protocol (RTOP), semi-structured interviews, and the Science Teaching Efficacy Beliefs Instrument (STEBI-A). Pearson's correlations and independent sample t-tests of coded qualitative data and quantitative survey data were conducted in order to compare the beliefs and practices regarding science teaching within and across PSTE levels. In addition, eight case profile teachers were chosen with varying combinations of high and low PSTE and RTOP scores in order to examine some of the complexities existing between science teaching self-efficacy beliefs and science teaching behaviors in closer detail. Results revealed that a majority of the positive behaviors commonly associated with greater science teaching self-efficacy, especially giving students more control over their own science learning, did manifest themselves in participants' beliefs about science teaching. However, most of these beliefs did not align with actual observed classroom practices. Interviews and observations of case profile teachers revealed how self-efficacy levels manifested themselves in different ways with different teachers. While there do appear to be some overall advantages to increasing elementary teachers' science teaching self-efficacy, the situation is much more complex than it is sometimes portrayed in the literature; by simply increasing elementary teachers' levels of efficacy beliefs, there is no guarantee that they will actually teach science in a more reformed, inquiry-based manner. The results of my dissertation should, therefore, give science teacher education researchers pause when making blanket assumptions about the benefits of increasing elementary teachers' self-efficacy

Suspended Education in California
The Civil Rights Project has been examining out-of-school suspensions since 1999 due to concerns about the frequency of suspensions, observed racial disparities in their systemic use and the possible negative impact, especially for children of color.  Most important, a robust study of school discipline by the Council of State Governments tracked every middle school student in Texas over 6 years and has helped educators crystalize what the evidence has always suggested: that the frequent use of out-of-school suspensions has no academic benefits, is strongly associated with low achievement, a heightened risk for dropping out and a greater likelihood of juvenile justice involvement.  If suspending a student out-of-school for minor infractions is a counterproductive educational response, logic dictates that it should be reserved as a measure of last resort. Unfortunately, education policy makers and parents are not fully aware of just how many students are at risk for being suspended.For the first time, this report and companion spreadsheet covering nearly 500 districts reveals to the public the unusually high levels of risk for suspension as well as the stark differences in discipline when these risks are presented by race, gender and disability status. The alarming findings suggest not only a hidden crisis for many historically disadvantaged subgroups in too many districts but also a widespread need to reform discipline policy for California’s public schools.
      Data released from the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) at the US Department of Education revealed that more than 400,000 students were suspended out-of-school at least one time during the 2009-10 school year in California.  That’s enough students suspended out-of-school to fill every seat in all the professional baseball and football stadiums in the state, with no guarantee of any adult supervision.  OCR collected data from districts on the number of students who were suspended just once during the year and the number suspended more than once. The analysis in this report combined these two mutually exclusive categories in order to report the number of students suspended one or more times as a percentage of their total enrollment. We describe this percentage throughout this report as the “risk” for suspension...

Californians for Literacy: A Historical Study of the Development of the California Library Literacy Services from 1984-2004
This thesis presents a history of the California Library Literacy Service from its founding in 1984 to its twentieth anniversary in 2004.  The California Library Literacy Service is a statewide library-based literacy instruction program funded with grant support from the California State Library that provides technical assistance and funding to California Public Libraries who offer tutoring to illiterate English-speaking adults.  This program helps 80,000-100,000 Californians every year who lack the functional literacy skills needed to complete daily literacy tasks.  The California Library Literacy Service views literacy is a partnership between adult learners and their community. The program has fostered many such literacy-centric partnerships across the state.  The story of the California Library Literacy Services is the story of many Californians who have worked to improve their own lives, the lives of others, and bring positive change to California.

Smart capital : the social networks of university presidents
Public higher education is in crisis and is begging for strong, effective leadership to ensure a sustainable future. This dissertation provides a brief history of public higher education, specifically in California, and reveals the desperate need for transformational changes in the way public higher education is offered. Such change will likely be initiated by leaders, both existing and emerging. As a variety of leadership types may be helpful for higher education, this paper unpacks the meaning of different styles and their relevance to higher education. With the knowledge that relationships are at the heart of leadership, a review of social networks and an extensive study of social capital follows. After identifying a gap in the literature relative to the intersection of leadership and social networks, particularly within the context of higher education, this paper studied that phenomenon. Using a qualitative, phenomenological method, this study interviewed eight presidents from a public, state university system in California to reveal the intersection of their social networks with their leadership. The findings from the interviews and document analysis revealed six strategies these presidents use in building relationships. Considering the six strategies as themes, the relationship between the presidents' social networks and their leadership behavior emerged in the form of the Leadership-Network Reciprocation (LNR) model. This dissertation concludes with a discussion of the LNR model and the implications for current and future presidents as well as other leaders in general

Redeeming qualities: exploring factors that affect women¿s use of reproductive health vouchers in Cambodia
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					One approach to delivering healthcare in developing countries is through voucher programs, where vouchers are distributed to a specific population for free or subsidized health care. Recent evaluations suggest that vouchers have the potential to extend coverage of priority health services to the poor in developing countries. In Cambodia, a reproductive health voucher program was implemented in January 2011. This study aims to explore women&#8217;s early experiences accessing health services with their vouchers at accredited clinics.
				
				
					
						Methods
					This qualitative exploratory study used focus group methodology to gather information from five groups of older (&gt;25 years) and four groups of younger (18&#8211;25 years) women who were eligible for the voucher program in three rural provinces. Focus groups were digitally recorded, transcribed and translated from Khmer into English. Data analysis was an iterative process, which comprised of open coding to find commonalities that reflected categories or themes and axial coding to relate initial themes to each other. Next, a basic framework for analysis was formed by integrating the themes into the framework.
				
				
					
						Results
					Two overarching themes were identified in the data: 1) factors that facilitate voucher use and 2) factors that inhibit voucher use. Within each of these themes, three subthemes were identified: 1) pre-existing factors, 2) distribution factors, and 3) redemption factors. Overall, women expressed positive feelings towards the voucher program, while several areas for program improvement were identified including the importance of addressing pre-existing demand-side barriers to using reproductive health services, the need for more comprehensive counselling during voucher distribution, and the persistent cost of unofficial payments expected by midwives after delivery irrespective of voucher use.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Early information from program beneficiaries can lead to timely and responsive changes that can help to maximize program success. This study highlights the importance of tailoring voucher programs to specific community needs, a strategy that can lead to better program uptake.

A Public Laboratory Dewey Barely Imagined: The Emerging Model of School Governance and Legal Reform
Public school reform raises the prospect of a broader redefinition of our very democracy.
      Related Documents    A Public Laboratory Dewey Barely Imagined: The Emerging Model of School Governance and Legal Reform
      
      After decades of apparent decay and immobilism, the American public school system is in the midst of a vast and promising reform. The core architectural principle of the emergent system is the grant by higher level authorities---federal government, states, school districts---to lower level ones of autonomy to pursue the broad goal of improving education. In return, the local entities—schools, districts, states—provide the higher ones with detailed information about their goals, how they intend to pursue them, and how their performance measures against their expectations. The core substantive commitment of the emergent system is the provision to all students, and particularly to racial and other minorities whom the public schools have traditionally short-changed, of an adequate education, where the definition of adequacy is continuously revised in the light of the improving performance of the best schools. At bottom, the reform seeks to provide an education that builds on the curiosity and needs of diverse students and uses the school system as a whole as a vast laboratory to determine how best to achieve this end. If it succeeds, it will attain on a national scale and with the help of robust institutions the goals that John Dewey’s famous Laboratory School in Chicago was able to approximate for roughly a hundred students for a few years.The new reform grows out of and is contributing to a new form of collaboration between courts, legislatures, and administrative agencies on the one side and between these organs of government and new forms of public action on the other. It thus redefines the separation of powers, and recasts the administrative state more generally, while opening the way to new forms of citizen participation in the orientation and operation of key public institutions. At the limit, school reform raises the prospect of a broader redefinition of our very democracy.

Math Play : growing and developing mathematics understanding in an emergent play-based environment
This project explores how mathematics growth and development can be supported, documented and assessed in an emergent play-based early childhood education environment inspired by the practices and principles of Reggio Emilia. Using the California Preschool Learning Foundations as a framework, Math Play includes developmentally appropriate activities and environments that support cognitive development within the mathematics domain. This curriculum documents how a classroom's emergent themes were interwoven into activities and environments that did not oppose the practices and principles of the approach. Math Play successfully documented each child's mathematic understanding as well as areas needing further growth and development. With the California Preschool Learning Foundations as a framework, teachers can use Math Play to establish a child's level of understanding within this domain that plays one of important roles in assessing a child's school readiness. Math Play provides examples of how teachers can use authentic formative portfolios for assessment of growth and development. Math Play provides an alternative for standardized assessment in an emergent play-based environment that authenticates the experiences that preschool children are having while growing and developing in a Reggio Emilia inspired environment. After implementation of Math Play the following two findings were deduced : 1. Children engaged and demonstrated a range of mathematic growth and development that corresponds with the eighteen sub-strands of the California Preschool Learning Foundations. 2. Authentic formative portfolios provided an effective way to discuss individual child mathematic growth and development with assistant teachers and parents. In addition to these findings the children who were involved in this research continued to grow and develop by engaging in activities that furthered their mathematic foundation after Math Play implementation

The Impact on Emergency Department Visits for Respiratory Illness During the Southern California Wildfires
Introduction: In 2007 wildfires ravaged Southern California resulting in the largest evacuation due to a wildfire in American history. We report how these wildfires affected emergency department (ED) visits for respiratory illness.
      Methods: We extracted data from a Kaiser Permanente database for a single metropolitan community ED. We compared the number of visits due to respiratory illness at time intervals of 2 weeks before and during the time when the fires were burning. We counted the total number of patients with chief complaint of dyspnea, cough, and asthma and final international classification of disease 9 coding diagnosis of asthma, bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and respiratory syndrome, and analyzed data for both total number and proportion of ED visits. We evaluated the data using Early Aberration Reporting System software to determine significant single-visit increases compared to expected counts. We also analyzed the average length of ED stay. Data on air quality were extracted from the http://www.airnow.gov site.
      Results: There were significant differences between pre-fire and fire period average visit counts for the chief complaints of dyspnea and asthma. Dypnea complaints increased by 3.2 visits per day. During the fire the diagnoses of asthma increased significantly by 2.6 patients per day. Air quality reached air quality index values of 300, indicating very unhealthy conditions. Average ED length of stay times remained unchanged during the fire period compared to the pre-fire period.
      Conclusion: The 2007 Southern California wildfires caused significant surges in the volume of ED patients seeking treatment for respiratory illness. Disaster plans should prepare for these surges when future wildfires occur. West J Emerg Med.

This is original work that makes use of NLP as a methodology for inquiring into subjective experience. The authors outline issues in the theory of and research into transformative learning, introduce the field of NLP, then describe the research design for the empirical work, a longitudinal case study of a manager reflecting on experiences of organizational change. Themes resulting from the analysis comprise the following three main categories: characteristics of the output, or of the emergent understanding of the learner; characteristics of the person’s inner process or journey; and characteristics of the interpersonal process between learner and facilitator. The article illustrates the application of NLP to the field of transformative learning, providing an example of its potential for empirical investigation.</p>

Getting Schooled: Intra-Ethnic Differentiation, School Acts in Making Differences
"We all go to school...nobody wants to be here, but that's the way it is!  Everyone's got to get schooled." Countless hours committed to classroom, playground and homework naturalize an otherwise arbitrary arrangement best understood as "getting schooled."  School participants fundamentally understand this education process is about acquiring explicit systematic instruction.  This dissertation presents the school experience as a place of multiple meanings where Intra-ethnic differentiation examines the process of identity categories among adolescents within a Chicano-Latino community set in a South Central middle school of Los Angeles, California.  This study documents the multiple categories as intra-ethnic differentiation among Chicano Latino school youth, defined as an experience of community fragmentation where members express distinct in-group differences that contrast an external appearance of homogeneity and or solidarity; fragmented into multiple dynamic identities set in internal relationships of rank.  The intra-ethnic inventory include: "cholos", "schoolies", "players", "los americanizados" ( the Americanized), "Chuntaros"( rift raft, undesirable poor), " the Mexican-Mexicans", "county rushers", " punks" and "posers."  The expressed divisions are characteristic of fluid boundaries involved in dialectic between-group relationships creating, modifying and challenging power, prestige and resources.  The following text demonstrates that each identity is accompanied by respective educational, social, economic, and institutional opportunities and boundaries.  The different identities exist as consequence of strategies of adaptation to socio-economic, political and national pressures. In a scholastic context, ethnic membership becomes a commodity of change responsive to survival mechanisms; identity models develop as abstract processes that are both self and externally defined and accompanied with real world consequences.  The students must contend with and navigate identity fields they did not create.  The demands, expectations and socioeconomic arrangements of the larger non curricular society are reflected and "acted out" on the school grounds.

The role of research evidence in school improvement : a case study of corrective action schools
The difference in performance between students of color and their white counterparts, better known as the academic achievement gap, in America has prompted many scholars, practitioners, and researchers to seek solutions that will help eliminate it. Researchers are beginning to investigate underlying social networks and tenets of organizational learning for the purpose of gaining insight into structures that support, constrain, or have no impact on the diffusion of research evidence within schools and school districts. This study investigated the processes two high schools in corrective action, sanctioned under the No Child Left Behind Act, engaged in to identify problems and solutions, and how these schools defined, acquired, used, and diffused research evidence in service reform. There has been very limited research done this area. Future research efforts that continue to investigate the convergence of research evidence, organizational learning, and social networks in school districts across the country have the potential to improve student achievement

Hayden White: Frontiers of Consciousness at UCSC
Hayden White was born in Martin, Tennessee in 1928. During the Depression he moved with his family to Detroit in search of work, where his father became a union organizer in the automotive world. This urban scene of workers’ struggles to organize in the face of sometimes-violent corporate opposition was a watershed moment in informing White’s political consciousness.
      After a stint in the military, he used the GI Bill to go to Wayne State University. White went on to graduate school at the University of Michigan. Dr. White spent a full twenty-three years teaching at other institutions before 1978, when he found a fertile space for his interdisciplinary conception of scholarly work as the chair of the University of California Santa Cruz’s History of Consciousness program.
      In this oral history, White relates that history of consciousness gradually came to occupy a shifting territory that ranged from deep in the artistic side of the humanities well into the social sciences, and served as a haven for people interested in studying unconventional or cutting edge topics that weren’t at home in disciplinary graduate programs. The program actively recruited both gay students and students of color, seeking traditionally devalued perspectives, and ultimately, according to White, had a higher percentage of non-white students than any other humanities doctoral program anywhere. By late 80s and early 90s it was one of the most renowned humanities Ph.D. programs in the country, with an annual acceptance rate of five to six students for three to four hundred applicants. In a field where competing private schools and more well-funded public schools could offer big fellowships, histcon students had little to no fellowship money, but in spite of this fiscal obstacle the program built an international reputation, and had an unusually high rate of post-degree job placement for its students. In these interviews, White candidly charts the personalities and ideas and debates that gave shape and direction to this flagship humanities program, including those perspectives that changed the program—and him personally—in ways he hadn’t anticipated, like feminist studies and cultural studies.
      In these sessions White discusses not just histcon and UCSC, but illuminates their broader contexts, discussing at length the fiscally slashed state of the humanities, the changing academic scene and wider geopolitical issues. More personally, he reflects on his philosophies on teaching, which he terms “a nobler designation,” and discusses his own writing and the historiographical subject matter that has inspired so much of his work. These interviews provide a vehicle for White to track the relationship of metahistory (the subject of his landmark book of thesame name) to history, and explain his conception of moral relativism and different means of interacting with the past.

This thinking ignores the better experiences of many other cities and also the METCO program that is intact and still in high demand.

Using purposeful perturbations as a strategy for school reform : a design experiment at an alternative high school with low-performing students
The goal of this research study was to develop, implement, and evaluate a school reform design experiment at an alternative high school with low-performing student. Like other school reform efforts, the goal was to achieve transformational change. While few educational reform efforts accomplish that goal, the reform efforts described here did result in transformational change. The complexity sciences served as a theoretical framework for this design experiment. The goal was to create an environment for change by pulling the school far from equilibrium using a strategy I call "purposeful perturbations" to disrupt the stable state of the school's setting. The methodology for this study was a design experiment. Data sources for this study included documents and records and audio-recorded interviews of school staff and students. A technique I call Artifact Elicited Response, designed to provide a new dimension to conducting audio-recorded interviews, was used to provide a detailed picture and a description of respondents' social networks within the school and with the broader context of the school. Analysis of data from documents and records and audio-recorded interviews served two purposes. First, the data was analyzed to investigate two research questions. If an innovative program, with the primary goal of academically preparing low-performing students for rigorous college coursework, is implemented at an alternative high school (1) What structures and patterns of behavior around academic preparation for college emerged as the program evolves? (2) In what ways did these emerging structures and patterns of behavior impact the organizational structure of the school's learning community? The data also served to allow design modifications to be made based on what emerged as a result of a particular purposeful perturbation. In this sense, the experimental design of my research was an iterative process. The setting for this research study was Gonzago High School (GHS), an alternative school with low- performing students located on the campus of St. Diaz City College. In this research study, an innovative college prep program, Academic Commitment Creates Empowered Successful Students (ACCESS) was created that disrupted GHS's stable state, and the process of implementing this program transformed the school

This case study explored how teachers who practice in the border region of San Diego and Tijuana implemented the professional development skills modeled for them in the Border Pedagogy Institute. Participants in this study educated Transnational Latino Immigrant students (TLI) on both sides of the border. An analysis of interviews of educators from both sides of the US/Mexican border revealed the transformation of educators and their practice influenced by professional development shaped by critical pedagogy applied to the border region, Border Pedagogy. A unique forum to address common educational issues related to educating borderland students, Border Pedagogy events provided teachers with multiple opportunities to converse about issues related to educating TLI students. Results of this case study highlighted differences and similarities in the systems on either side of the border, the unique needs of TLI students, concerns about standardized testing in a second language, sensitivity to the culture of students, the importance of using primary language support, and the value of face to face conversations to build relationships between teachers on both sides of the border. Mutual respect and understanding of each other's work was developed, cross border teaching and implementation of the modeled strategies occurred, and a commitment was made by participants to change current instructional practice to better serve TLI students. This study also created additional questions that could serve as the focus of future studies in the borderlands between Mexico and the United States, specifically in the Tijuana/ San Diego region

Bayesian invariant measurements of generalisation
The problem of evaluating different learning rules and other statistical estimators is analysed. A new general theory of statistical inference is developed by combining Bayesian decision theory with information geometry. It is coherent and invariant. For each sample a unique ideal estimate exists and is given by an average over the posterior. An optimal estimate within a model is given by a projection of the ideal estimate. The ideal estimate is a sufficient statistic of the posterior, so practical learning rules are functions of the ideal estimator. If the sole purpose of learning is to extract information from the data, the learning rule must also approximate the ideal estimator. This framework is applicable to both Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods, with arbitrary statistical models, and to supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning schemes

When environments collide : the role of social identity and drinking among working students
The normative environment, often represented by college peer and friend interactions, is a strong and consistent predictor of problem drinking in college. However, many students work in addition to attending college and the influence of this other peer group is not well studied. This study sought to address this gap using two objectives : 1) to test social identity as a moderator between descriptive drinking norms and problem drinking among students that work, and 2) to test the relationship between working in the hospitality industry among college students that work and drinking, and to examine factors that might mediate that relationship. The study was implemented via a cross-sectional web-survey conducted in the Fall of 2009 (n=760). Of the 760 students, 330 students were employed and included in the study. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), a test for the moderating effect of social identity was non-significant (CMIN=2.26 64, CFI=.97, RMSEA= .05). A post hoc analysis splitting the model into two groups (hospitality vs. non- hospitality) showed a significant moderating effect of social identity among non-hospitality workers, (b=.14, p< .05, CMIN=1.17 128, CFI=.94 RMSEA=.05). For the second objective, working in hospitality was significantly associated with problem drinking (b =.23, p<.001, CMIN=1.72 17, CFI=.99, RMSEA=.05) and the descriptive drinking norm was a partial mediator (indirect effect = .078, p<.001). This study showed that coworker-drinking norms influence student drinking and that social identity may be an important moderator between norms and behavior. Also, norms seem to account for some of the effect of working in hospitality on drinking. This study establishes coworkers as an important peer group for college student interventions and that working in hospitality should be viewed as a risk group for drinking among college populations. Future studies should further examine both what are the factors that predict students working in hospitality and how those factors moderate the work environment's effect on drinking as well as the factors that mediate the association between hospitality and drinking

Meeting undergraduate students' expectations of the University experience : how enrollment managers can secure students' loyalties
Historically, university leaders have met campus enrollment goals by focusing on recruiting prospective students. In the last few decades, however, as global competition for fewer students in a poor economy has forced them to spend more on recruitment and marketing, they have realized that retaining current students is actually a more cost-effective enrollment strategy than merely recruiting them. This realization has come about, in part, because for-profit companies in the service industry are finding it more profitable to concentrate on retaining customers' loyalties than expanding their customer bases. The business practice of developing long- term relationships with customers by meeting their expectations is known as relationship marketing. Although this is an established theory and practice in the business community, university administrators have yet to fully realize its potential as an enrollment management strategy. Considering that for a century, about half of university students have failed to graduate, enrollment managers should welcome a new approach that might remedy this long-standing retention issue. This study utilized relationship-marketing theory as a framework to understand the issue of university student retention. Relationship- marketing and enrollment management literature were reviewed to examine the relevance of customer service strategy to student retention efforts. The qualitative study used a multiple cross-sectional design to examine student loyalty at three points in time during the undergraduate student life cycle. Freshmen, seniors, and alumni from a public research university in California were interviewed about their expectations of university life, satisfaction with university experiences, and demonstrations of loyalty behavior. To supplement the interview data, blogs written by freshmen, seniors, and alumni attending eight campuses in the same university system were analyzed for evidence of satisfaction/ dissatisfaction with their experiences as well as evidence of loyalty behavior. The research findings provide insight into what factors affect undergraduate students' loyalties throughout the student life cycle. When it came to the university experience, these findings showed that students' loyalty behaviors was more strongly linked to the fulfillment of their expectations than to the achievement of their satisfaction. The findings also illuminate how university leaders can meet the expectations of students in order to retain them

Is Arizona's Approach to Educating its ELs Superior to Other Forms of Instruction?
In the Horne v. Flores Supreme Court decision of June 25, 2009, the Court wrote that one basis for finding Arizona in compliance with federal law regarding the education of its English learners was that the state had adopted a "significantly more effective" instructional model for EL students, that being Structured English Immersion (SEI). This paper reviews the extant research on SEI, its definitions, origins, strategies. The paper concludes that there is no research basis for the court's conclusion, that at best SEI is no better or no worse than other instructional strategies when they are both well implemented and the goal is English acquisition. However, SEI as implemented in Arizona carries serious negative consequences for EL students stemming from the excessive amount of time dedicated to it, the de-emphasis on grade level academic curriculum, the discrete skills approach it employs, and the segregation of EL students from mainstream peers. Moreover, the paper argues that there are, in fact, strategies that can ameliorate these problems as well as provide an additive, rather than a subtractive, educational experience for English learner and mainstream students alike.

Changes Experienced by Latino Parents of Adolescents Through a Parent Training Program in an Urban Community
The author presented results from a qualitative study of the changes experienced by 13 Latino parents of adolescents in East Los Angeles participating in a parent training program.  Data collected from classroom observations, focus groups, and interviews with the instructors of the parent training program were triangulated to determine that the skills of showing love and affection and improved communication through listening instead of yelling were changes most commonly reported by parent participants positively affecting the parent-child relationship.  Barriers to implementing these skills included parents' assumptions regarding the parent-child relationship, culture and upbringing, and fear of unknown outcomes.  Despite these barriers, there is substantial overlap between the goals of the program and the changes reported by parents.  Instructors tailored the parent training curriculum to the target demographic by engaging parents in roleplaying and by sharing personal stories and examples to provide context.

Connecting Math Methods and Student Teaching through Practice-Based Strategies: A Study of Pre-Service Teachers' Math Instruction
There have been many calls for greater research into the connection between what is taught to pre-service teachers and how those teachings emerge in teacher practice (Cochran-Smith & Zeichner, 2005; Grossman, 2008). Understanding this connection and strengthening it is vital to the increased effectiveness of not just teacher education programs but of teachers and the increased learning of students.  In order to strengthen this connection, researchers have been pushing for pre-service teacher learning to become more practice-based (Ball et. al, 2009, Windschitl et al., 2009). The teacher education program in this study used a practice-based framework to design a math methods course which articulated critical aspects for teaching and learning mathematics (i.e., ensuring mathematical rigor, creating mathematical student discourse, and using equitable practices), and taught high-leverage strategies to meet these critical aspects. This study investigated how these practice-based, high-leverage strategies emerged in pre-service teacher practice in their student teaching classrooms. Focusing on secondary math in a large urban school district, this study sought to answer the questions 1) How do the practice-based strategies taught in a math methods class emerge in pre-service teachers' student teaching practice? 2) What supports the emergence of these strategies in a pre-service teacher's student teaching practice and what impedes it? The study followed six pre-service teachers through a yearlong methods course and into their student teaching classrooms, and used classroom observations, interviews, artifact collection and logs of teacher practice to answer the questions. The findings suggest that pre-service teachers can use high-leverage practices in a way that is rigorous, creates student mathematical discourse, and equitable participation. The study proposes the following additions to the design of future math methods courses: 1) pre-service teachers enacting the practices in environments with increasingly more independence and less support before trying it in their own classrooms and, 2) sharing with their math methods course peers their findings after the enactment of the strategies in their student teaching classroom. These findings have implications for how we may more effectively teach methods to bring about change in classroom practices.

Situated mathematics instruction : the interaction of teacher knowledge, beliefs, and policy interpretation
Students in the U.S. demonstrate a pattern of knowing mathematics as procedures rather than as a discipline of principled reasoning. International studies trace this pattern to cultural regularities within classroom mathematics instruction. Current researchers seeking to understand the expression of mathematics instruction explore dyadic, and sometimes mediational, relationships between teachers' mathematical knowledge for teaching, their beliefs about teaching and learning mathematics, their social interactions, and their interpretations of curricular materials. However, most prior studies have not taken the school, district, or policy context into account as a mediating factor. Using a situative perspective, this study incorporates these factors into a comprehensive exploration of what plays into teachers' mathematics instruction. This study used a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to gather information about the factors influencing mathematics instruction of seven upper elementary grade teachers in a single school district. It used validated surveys and assessments to measure teachers' knowledge for teaching mathematics and beliefs about teaching and learning mathematics. Observational data were also analyzed using pre-established rubrics to characterize the mathematical quality of teachers' instruction. Additionally, teacher interviews were conducted to uncover teachers' interpretations of policies and triangulate knowledge and beliefs data. The data were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively using within and cross-case approaches. Analysis of the data revealed that the mathematical quality of the teachers' instruction was determined by dynamic interaction between each teacher's beliefs, knowledge, policy interpretation, and context- specific factors. Teachers' mathematical knowledge for teaching was related to their mathematical explanations and responses to student math productions during instruction. However, the study also found that curricular materials, teachers' interactions with their colleagues, and local policies played a critical role in mediating instructional quality. Knowledge, beliefs, and interpretation of curriculum and accountability policies interacted differently depending on the teachers' social and institutional contexts. Implications for practice are discussed

An Investigation of Teacher Trust in the Principal
The purpose of this work was to understand the concept of trust, its meaning, antecedents, and outcomes as they applied to teacher trust in principals. Since there are very few in-depth studies specifically on trust in a school principal, research on trust from an organizational perspective was consulted. This body of research has numerous and valuable studies on trust in organizations that assisted in helping to understand how trust develops and flourishes within an organization's structure in general and how it applies to a school as a specific type of organization. Data for this study were collected using a modification of a survey instrument from Mayer and Davis (1999) and McAllister (1995).  Data from the four-part self-administered survey were used to build a structural equation model (SEM) that studied the relationships between teacher trust in the principal to the following: principal trustworthiness; teachers' propensity to trust; principal teacher interaction patterns; background similarity between the teacher and the principal; student demographics; and overall school achievement.  The data for this study were included responses from 377 teachers in 13 elementary schools in one Southern California school district.  The trust model developed in this study confirmed the existence of a second-order factor for trustworthiness which integrated the first-order factors for ability, benevolence, and integrity. This second-order factor was a strong predictor of teacher trust for their principals.  As a result, a teacher's perceived trustworthiness of a principal can be viewed as being comprised of three distinct factors (ability, benevolence, and integrity). Teacher propensity to trust other adults had its strongest influence on the actual level of trust teachers have for their principals.  The propensity factor also influenced the extent to which teachers find their principals to be of trustworthy character.  The propensity factor also had a negative relationship with the perception of principal benevolence--independent of the overall level of trustworthiness measured by the second-order factor. The specific frequency of interaction factor did not have an independent affect on the factor that measured a teacher's actual trust in his/her principal. A strong relationship between teachers viewing their principals as trustworthy and the frequency of principal/teacher interactions also was found--with trustworthiness as being dependent on frequency of interaction. It was also demonstrated that the factor structures accounting for teacher trust of their principals are independent of the specific school context or the particular principal being evaluated.  The factors of propensity and specific frequency of interaction also relied on common measurement items. Finally, a significant relationship between principal and teacher trust and background similarity between teachers and principals as Zucker (1986) proposed was not found to exist. Student demographics and overall student achievement (though limited to one item) also did not have a significant relationship with teacher trust in the principal. Some discussion was also provided on the strength of the proposed model's fit and how it could possibly be improved.

Unsettling the archive : dis- imagining colonial subjects to re-imagine knowledge production
This thesis examines off-reservation boarding schools and national archives as particular colonial formations. Employing experience as a methodology, it recounts research undertaken relative to a boarding school journal, using it as a conduit through which to comprehend the relationship between these institutions and settler colonialism. While integrating the journal in its argument, this thesis also refuses disclosure of the contents of the journal, instead centralizing the idea that boarding schools and archives exist as intimately related colonial institutions. Boarding schools have come to shape understandings of Native peoples within the US imaginary at the same time that archives continue to maintain that formation across time and space by providing "evidence" and/or "proof" of the boarding school as an "authentic" Native experience. These institutions function to sustain a relationship between contemporary understandings of Native sovereignty and self-determination struggles and knowledge production, examining how these institutions are always already bound up within the logics of settler colonialism. As a consequence, these institutions actively inform contemporary social discourse and political possibilities for Native peoples, confining them within the terms of US settler colonial jurisdiction. It examines colonial epistemologies' impact on the comprehensibility of Indigenous peoples' struggles in order to imagine alternative epistemologies in methodology and knowledge production that may work in service to those struggles

Exploring the beliefs, expectations, and practices of effective teachers of Latino students in high poverty high schools
Nationally, the problem of our persistent achievement gap between Latino students and their White counterparts has proven to be an issue that is not easy to remediate. The problem takes on added urgency when considering the rapid growth of the Latino population. Although the problem is complex, it is known that teacher quality is central to student learning. This study focuses on exploring the beliefs, expectations and practices of highly effective teachers working in high poverty high schools serving predominately Latino populations. To address this purpose, two primary research questions are explored : 1. What are the espoused beliefs, expectations and practices of high school teachers who have been recognized for their effectiveness in teaching Latino students?. 2. Are there patterns and relationships that emerge in the espoused beliefs, expectations or practices of successful teachers of Latino high school students working in high poverty schools?. The effective teachers are interviewed using an interview protocol based on the research of Martin Haberman. Teacher responses are analyzed and reveal significant findings of the importance of caring relationships and attitudes from teachers to ensure success of their Latino students, referred to as Pillars of Caring. The findings have implications for administrators and policy makers with respect to educational preservice programs, professional development, and hiring practices

Familial Contribution to Chinese American Children's Self-Regulated Learning  during the Early School Years
This dissertation examined how Chinese American children's everyday family experiences contributed to their self-regulated learning during the early school years. A total of 154 immigrant Chinese parents participated in this study and completed nine sets of multi-point rating questionnaires on a secured website. A series of analysis of covariance and hierarchical regressions were performed. Results provided the first empirical evidence that children's participation in family rituals and routines had significant positively influences on children's self-regulated learning strategies, over and above the influences of parental expectations of children's school attainment and executive functions.  Children's competence in self-regulated learning strategies, in turn, was positive related to their academic achievement. Results also indicated that parental self-efficacy in helping children succeed in school positively influenced Chinese American children's opportunities to participate in family rituals and routines. Nevertheless, unexpected results demonstrated that Chinese American first and fourth graders did not differ significantly on self-regulated learning strategies and participation in family rituals and routines. One possible explanation is that Chinese American children may have already developed self-regulated learning strategies, and started to participate in family rituals and routines before they enter first grade. The dissertation concludes with a discussion of the implications and limitations of this research.

Mrs. Miller's evolution in teaching science as inquiry : a case study of a teacher's change in responsiveness
Calls for reform-based science instruction have highlighted inquiry as a critical component in science education (e.g. National Research Council NRC, 1996, 2000, 2007). To date, there has been little research describing how teachers' classroom practice changes as they implement inquiry-based instruction. This study characterizes how an experienced elementary school teacher changed with respect to her responsiveness to student thinking (i.e. the degree to which she followed up on her students' ideas) as she implemented three iterations of an inquiry-based module on the water cycle. This research was guided by two overarching questions : (1) How can a teacher's responsiveness to student thinking be characterized?; and (2) How does one teacher, Mrs. Miller, change with respect to her responsiveness to her students' thinking over the course of three iterations of an inquiry -based module? In order to answer these questions, two distinct, yet complementary, methods of analysis were used. Method 1: Discourse analysis of classroom dialogue led to the operationalization of the "redirection." Redirections are teacher bids to "redirect" students' attention from one locus to another and reflect differing degrees of responsiveness, according to the degree to which the teacher takes up students' ideas. Initial quantitative analyses of Mrs. Miller's redirections showed that while she did change in her responsiveness to student thinking, the change was not linear. When Mrs. Miller's highly responsive redirections were analyzed, however, she seemed more likely to use highly responsive redirections to perpetuate students' potentially productive ideas during Implementation 2 and especially during Implementation 3. Such results suggested that Mrs. Miller grew in responsiveness over time. Method 2 : Phenomenological analyses of Mrs. Miller's practice provided further support of her increased responsiveness to student thinking. Mrs. Miller seemed more willing to encourage students' consideration and elaboration of "alternative" explanations during Implementations 2 and 3. Additionally, she appeared more likely to allow student ideas to inform future discussions during later implementations. This research provides the educational community with a detailed description of a veteran teacher's change in responsiveness during inquiry instruction and establishes a foundation from which others interested in teacher change and/or promoting reform-based instruction can build

Reconfiguring Admissions to Serve the Mission of Selective Public Higher Education
On what bases should students be admitted to highly selective public colleges and universities? In Texas under Hopwood, and in California under Proposition 209, the answer is: "by the numbers." With lawsuits pending in Michigan and a state initiative underway in Washington, the same response may soon be heard more frequently. Given the uneven circumstances from which students’ grades and class rank arise, the most potent numbers in admissions are often those from high-stakes standardized, norm-referenced tests (HSSNRTs), such as the SAT, ACT, and LSAT. Proponents of this approach argue that consideration of candidates' race or ethnicity violate laws against discrimination on the basis of race. They also assert that when HSSNRT scores are emphasized, merit is placed at the center of admissions decisions (See e.g., Thernstrom & Thernstrom, 1997; D'Souza, 1991). This score-ranked conception of merit is readily conveyed and grasped: the higher the score, the more an applicant deserves to be admitted. Nevertheless this conception is erroneously narrow: HSSNRT scores reveal little about who will succeed in higher education; they say far less about who will succeed thereafter. Thus, this score-ranked conception does not clearly support selective higher education’s mission to achieve excellence in instruction, research, and service. Furthermore, when put into practice, this score-ranked conception yields devastating social consequences.

A Multifaceted Mathematical Approach for Complex Systems
Applied mathematics has an important role to play in developing the tools needed for the analysis, simulation, and optimization of complex problems. These efforts require the development of the mathematical foundations for scientific discovery, engineering design, and risk analysis based on a sound integrated approach for the understanding of complex systems. However, maximizing the impact of applied mathematics on these challenges requires a novel perspective on approaching the mathematical enterprise. Previous reports that have surveyed the DOE?s research needs in applied mathematics have played a key role in defining research directions with the community. Although these reports have had significant impact, accurately assessing current research needs requires an evaluation of today?s challenges against the backdrop of recent advances in applied mathematics and computing. To address these needs, the DOE Applied Mathematics Program sponsored a Workshop for Mathematics for the Analysis, Simulation and Optimization of Complex Systems on September 13?14, 2011. The workshop had approximately 50 participants from both the national labs and academia. The goal of the workshop was to identify new research areas in applied mathematics that will complement and enhance the existing DOE ASCR Applied Mathematics Program efforts that are needed to address problems associated with complex systems. This report describes recommendations from the workshop and subsequent analysis of the workshop findings by the organizing committee.

The "Iron Cage" of Division I Athletics and Football as Status Imperatives: Constraint and Change Among American Universities
Throughout the history of American higher education sports have been closely identified with universities and campus life. Intercollegiate athletics occupies a peculiar space in the university; it is an institution within the universe of higher education. While extremely popular among many, there are charges that emphasis on college sports' results in mission drift in the university through its inherent commercialization and professionalism, emphasis on entertainment for the masses rather than educational opportunities for students, persistently increasing costs, and the exploitation of athletes. Despite these challenges, some schools choose to amplify their commitment to athletics through upward movement in competitive level. This project studies the phenomenon of movement in the NCAA divisional hierarchy by American universities and characteristics of institutions that chose to move. Incorporating elements of institutional and neo-institutional theory, this dissertation analyzed whether upward movement within the NCAA hierarchy is common despite the challenges associated with it and also what characteristics distinguish institutions that move from those that do not. Using data supplied by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Integrated Post-Secondary Education Database (IPEDS), this work identified schools that moved upward in the NCAA divisional structure and analyzed the nature of these movements across divisions to provide a clear picture of this phenomenon over twenty seven years. Findings show that the population is mostly stable; movement is not common, and that upward movement is far more frequent than downward. Characteristics shown to influence a school to move include density of institutions with in its geographic district, the number of male students enrolled, and whether or not the school fielded an independent men's sports team at the Division I level.. The data further indicate that two dominant models exist related to universities' use of athletic programs: schools either "go Division I" or add football. While the concept of institutional isomorphism (DiMaggio and Powell, 1991) provides a primary lens for analysis, this study does not represent a direct application of institutional or neo-institutional theory but is grounded in institutional and neo-institutional theories of organizational change as modified by consideration of institutional and environmental characteristics.

Teaching deaf students to understand perspective across content areas
A bilingual curriculum relating to the teaching of perspective in multiple subject areas was designed and implemented for this thesis. The curriculum uses two languages, ASL and English, to expose deaf students to varying types of perspective in art, mathematics, language arts, history, and in the social context. This curriculum moves from looking at perspectives with objects, to fictitious characters, to real people in the past, and finally to perspective in the students' lives. The results of the implementation show that using this curriculum can improve students' ability to understand how a character's perspective can influence the way s/he perceives a situation in children's literature and their ability to solve conflicts in the social realm

Improving geographic literacy : the effects of motivation, project-based instruction, and collaborative learning
Traveltopia was created as a tool for educators to teach elementary geography skills. By developing map-reading skills, through encoding and decoding maps, this curricular project explores how students can expand their spatial thinking skills and conceptual understanding of geography. The curriculum was implemented in a fourth grade classroom of thirty-two students with a wide range of academic abilities. The students collaborated on group projects with an authentic audience of people interested in the content, not just an audience of one, such as the teacher. Students had an equal opportunity to participate in the research, written, visual, and presentation of their culminating project. Theories of motivation and collaboration regarding student choice, flexible environments, and heterogeneous grouping were factored in this project design. Traveltopia offers support to teachers who are interested in teaching geography in an interactive and engaging way. The unit was designed to establish a cooperative learning environment through independent, small group, and whole class activities. Through this method of teaching and learning, students were also able to establish a community of learners. Data was collected and analyzed from teacher observations and field notes, student writing prompts and surveys, interviews, and the students' final group project. Results indicated that the majority of students became more motivated working collaboratively and improved their geography skill sets when immersed in project-based learning. Ultimately, students will be able to apply the skills learned in this unit and connect it to the geography that touches their own lives outside of the classroom

Essays in labor economics and the economics of education
This dissertation addresses three broad issues within the fields of labor economics and the economics of education: the accumulation of human and information capital, school quality, and policy-relevant analysis of classroom organization. At the secondary-school level, I document the importance of information capital, or accurate information about postsecondary and labor-market alternatives. At the elementary-school level, I analyze the effect of combination classes and discuss different ways to measure school quality and the importance of these measures to parents of school-aged children. In the first chapter, "Information Capital and Early-Career Wages," I define one measure of information capital acquired by students during high school and develop a framework through which I analyze the effect of this measure on educational attainment, job tenure, and wages. I also investigate the school-level characteristics that influence an individual's stock of information capital. In the second chapter, "Combination Classes and Educational Achievement," I measure the effect of membership in a combination class in first grade on student achievement. I address the selection that occurs when implementing a combination class and find that first graders in 1-2 combinations can be expected to outperform single-grade students on math tests by one-seventh of a standard deviation. In addition, I find no evidence that first graders in schools offering combination classes perform worse than first graders in schools that do not offer such classes. Therefore, I conclude that combination classes may be a Pareto-improving option for school administrators. In the last chapter, "Neighborhood Demographics, School Effectiveness, and Residential Location Choice," I investigate how neighborhood demographics and school effectiveness influence the residential location decisions of parents of different income levels. I find that low-income parents in the San Francisco Bay Area respond more strongly to school effectiveness than to neighborhood demographics, but that the reverse is true for high-income parents

Dialect Contact in a Los Angeles Public School
As is well known, Los Angeles is home to a large number of Spanish-speaking immigrants from a variety of different countries. Studies on the Spanish spoken in LA County have demonstrated the existence of a distinct dialect, a product of koineization and dialect leveling. In this paper we seek to explore the dynamics of such leveling as it occurs in a public elementary school in this area. Taking into consideration the fact that use of Spanish is not permited in the public school classroom, we choose to observe children’s use of this language during recess, lunch and a structured after school program designed to help Spanish speakers improve their English skills. These observations are further supplemented by answers to informal interviews with students froom the after school program. The evidence that we find provides further support for the validity of LA Spanish as a distinct dialect and serves to illuminate, at least in part, the role that the public school setting plays in the creation of linguistic norms.

Proactive campus supervision : a high school case
An embedded, single-case study was conducted to make a disciplined inquiry into campus supervision at South Main High School . The study examined the campus supervision program currently being used by the school. At the time of this dissertation, very little literature existed in the area of campus supervision programs. The goal of this dissertation was to answer the following research questions: How can a proactive campus supervision program that focuses on the concepts of resiliency can create a safer school environment, how do teachers view campus supervisors, how do administrators view campus supervisors, and how do students perceive the role of campus supervision? Five data sources contributed to the results section of this case study. The five data sources include : 823 student surveys, 52 teacher surveys, 3 administrator questionnaires, 4 campus supervisor interviews, and 4 student interviews. The student survey was designed to measure students' rapport with campus supervisors, students' perception of the work that campus supervisors do, and student trust of campus supervisors. The survey consisted of five descriptive questions followed by twenty statements requiring a degree of "unlikely or likely" responses along a Likert scale. The teacher survey was a modification of the student survey. The administrative questionnaire was designed as a series of open ended questions designed to probe into the administration and campus supervision relationship. The campus supervisor and student interviews were also given a series of open ended questions with some probing questions as well. The significant findings include the discovery of four elements of proactive campus supervision and the creation of a model of proactive campus supervision at South Main High School

Where is the instructional leader? : how the district office creates the ties that keep principals connected to the classroom
To prepare all students--regardless of their abilities, language, and economic or cultural differences--to learn the skills needed for success in a global economy, teachers need training and support to teach in ways that respond to children's differences and to the changes in our world. The instructional leadership skills of the site principal make a difference in how effectively teachers meet these challenges. The role of the district office in preparing principals to become instructional leaders is relatively unmined in the literature. This study portrays the perspective of leaders at school sites and central offices in three small K-6 school districts in California. Data sources include interviews of principals and district office leaders, documents, observations from districts with commonalities in size and geographic area, and differences in student demographics and profiles of district leadership stability. Through the lens of sociocultural learning theory, this study explored how the district office experiences change as a result of principals' focus on instructional leadership. All three study districts show evidence of the development of community of practice and implementation of recommendations from district reform literature. Conditions that support or constrain individual and collective learning appear to reflect the historical and cultural context of the district. The study results demonstrate ways that district office leaders build principals' instructional leadership capacity by creating important ties that keep the principal connected to the classroom. District leaders establish structures so that principals learn with teachers and with other school and district leaders. The goal of this learning is for principals to know the curriculum and what good teaching looks like. District leaders create teams of principals and teacher-leaders who provide professional development that reflects the teachers' understanding of classroom realities and the principals' conceptualization of school, district, state, and national goals. The district office creates ties between principals and other leaders so they learn from each other and reduce the isolation of the job. District leaders can keep the organization focused on teaching and learning by reducing distractions and continuously building a team that shifts the culture as a result of individual and collective learning

Public School Desegregation in the United States, 1968 - 1980
It is now more that fourteen years since the Supreme Court rejected gradual and voluntary transfers between black and white schools and called for root-and-branch desegregation. Almost a decade has passed since the first Supreme Court decision requiring citywide bussing outside the South. But the national debate over school desegregation continues to be intense. We are experiencing another national attack on court-ordered desegregation by national leaders, including the president and attorney general. The federal grant program supporting desegregation was repealed in 1981 and there are numerous proposals in Congress to limit the use of bussing for desegregation. At the same time, in courtrooms across the country, civil rights groups continue to wage protracted legal battles against segregation.

(Mis)Aligned Ambitions? Parent Resources, Student Alignment, and Piecing Together the Hispanic College Puzzle
The fact that Latina/o students are losing ground to their non-Latino White peers in four-year college enrollment and bachelor's degree attainment even as Latino college enrollment and graduation rates are at an all time high constitutes a perplexing puzzle. In order to realize the potential "demographic dividend" embedded in the diverse youth population entering the U.S. workforce in the next two decades, it will be critical to fill in the missing pieces of what has been referred to as the Hispanic college puzzle. The current study contributes several new pieces to the puzzle of Latina/o postsecondary attainment. Using a national longitudinal database and structural equation modeling techniques, I investigate the possibility that the degree of alignment, or, alternatively, misalignment, between high school students' postsecondary expectations and their actions taken toward fulfilling those ambitions mediates intergenerational resource transmission. The results demonstrate that the extent to which students with high postsecondary expectations prepare during high school to realize their goals can have a marked influence on the level at which they enroll in college. This is true regardless of whether the student is White or Latino, and irrespective of nativity status among Latino youth. The findings also suggest that there are meaningful differences both between Latino and non-Latino White students, as well as within the Latino youth population across generations, with respect to the availability and convertibility of various types of parent capital--in particular, forms of parent social capital--into higher levels of student alignment and college enrollment. Overall, the results of this research suggest that alignment can serve much like a bridge on the road to college, such that when students are able to align their actions with their college expectations and then fully capitalize on that match, they are more likely to enroll in a four-year institution. However, in order for Latino students to bridge their college expectations to higher levels of enrollment, students and their families must be able to forge the sorts of social connections that can help them access and make use of timely and accurate information and guidance during the college choice and enrollment process.

Principals' perceptions of autonomy to implement change for English language learners
For almost three decades a spotlight has been placed on the problems of the American educational system. Reform efforts put into place were intended to improve our schools by ensuring that all students' needs were met and to close the achievement gap however, the number of schools and districts labeled as failing is growing and the achievement gap grows larger. In California, one particular significant subgroup, English language learners, is a group whose population continues to grow in number and yet the number of students in this subgroup who are not meeting state targets grows (California Department of Education, 2009). As this crisis evolves, and a myriad of reform efforts are exhausted, the role of the instructional leader evolves as well. The latest federal legislation, No Child Left Behind (NCLB) has created a high stakes accountability climate by setting federal mandates for increasing levels of student achievement of significant subgroups. Schools and their districts who fail to meet Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) guidelines for all subgroups are subject to progressive degrees of corrective action. This might include restructuring the school by removing or replacing the school site's instructional leader. As a result, the role of principal takes on even greater importance as educational researchers and policymakers seek reforms to meet these new demands. These reforms or demands for immediate changes, designed to support student achievement may actually constrain the role of the principal as the instructional leader. The primary purpose of this study was to examine how reform efforts support or constrain principal autonomy in meeting the needs of English language learners. Utilizing the theoretical frameworks of School Reform and Social Network Theory, this study compared the level of principal autonomy in two distinct districts, one centralized and the other decentralized, that is, how information and resources are transmitted. This mixed methods study compared student data, survey results of district and site leaders, principal interviews and a review of documents

K-12 teacher participation in online professional development
Effectiveness in education is a national concern and reform efforts continue to be championed with the hope of stimulating improvement to more effectively meet the needs of all students. Many reform efforts include a focus on teacher professional development to strengthen teacher pedagogy and positively impact student achievement. Rapid expansion and increased use of technology have created opportunities that never existed before to support teachers. Online, as an alternative to traditional face-to -face professional development, is currently underutilized in K-12 school districts. This study intended to investigate successful models of online professional development to inform district decision-making at the local level. K-12 teachers from fifteen states, who participated in a successful online professional development experience, were invited to complete a survey to provide insight about how a professional development experience positively impacted their teaching, learning, and classroom. Of the 328 teachers who responded, three people were interviewed to learn more about their particular online professional development experience. Study findings show that participants highly value online professional development because of the convenience, accessibility, and ability to self-pace and differentiate learning. Online professional development has the unique potential to foster reflection, deep thought, and analysis particularly when there is the potential to interact with an online professional learning community over time. A significant finding is that teachers thrive on the interaction and sharing of ideas between colleagues in job -alike situations. Additionally, findings show that when teachers participate with face-to-face school or grade- level teams online, they reap even greater learning benefits. The majority of participants found that online professional development helped them improve their knowledge of curriculum and instructional strategies and improved their technology skills. They learned ways to improve their classrooms to meet the needs of diverse student populations and helped validate effective practices that were already firmly in place. Educational leaders should consider online professional development as a strong viable option to improve teacher practice. Findings suggest that district leaders should recommend State Department of Education and commercial online learning opportunities that are subject-area focused and aligned to district/school goals. They should encourage teacher teams to participate together online and face-to- face to deepen learning. By recommending specific online learning experiences and encouraging teachers to participate together, districts will be well served by the effective online professional development offerings that are available

Teacher change in the context of a proof-centered professional development
Though it is widely acknowledged that teachers' knowledge of mathematics is a cornerstone on which their instructional practices are based, little research exists documenting the impact of changes in teachers' mathematical content knowledge on their teaching practices. As proving is a central activity in the study of mathematics, a teacher's proof schemes (in the sense of Harel and Sowder, 1998) enable and constrain instructional approaches. For professional developers hoping to better understand the impact of teachers' proof schemes on their instructional practices, examinations of specific cases, with special attention to the nature and mechanisms of change in proof schemes and teaching practice, provide insight into the organization of effective professional development (PD) for teachers in the domain of proving. The case study reported here examines the development of proof schemes and teaching practices of one in-service secondary mathematics teacher who participated in an off- site PD for two years. Two data sources were examined: video of the participant doing mathematics at the PD and footage of her own teaching. The analysis of proof schemes focuses on proof production during the PD. Development of the teacher's practice was also investigated during the two academic years following each summer. The study includes theoretical connections (using Harel's DNR Theoretical Framework) between developments in the teacher's proof schemes and teaching practices. Specifically, this study asked : (1) What changes were observed in one participant's proving and proof schemes as she participated in the PD? (2) What connections can be found between her experiences at the PD (including changes in her proof schemes) and the evolution of her teaching practices in a whole class setting? It was found that she became increasingly able to identify pivotal statements in her own proofs that had previously been left unattended. The participant showed evidence of a transition from empirical to deductive proof schemes. The greatest developments in teaching practices were observed in the practices of handling students' solutions by encouraging student-to-student talk, asking students to prove conjectures, soliciting alternative solutions in the presence of correct solutions, and attending to mathematical detail in correct solutions

Tourism Education: life begins at 40
<p>Tourism Education: life begins at 40  Tourism education is now about 40 years old. It has emerged as a subject of serious academic study from a rapidly growing field of practice. This paper explores the development of knowledge and research about tourism as a background to consider the ways in which the efforts and priorities of those interested in tourism education have changed and it questions whether the subject has reached a stage of maturity. It traces a pattern of change from a focus on vocationalism and the business aspects of tourism during which time attention was given simply to measuring and describing the education provision (the industrial stage); to a stage when other disciplines made their mark on tourism, associated with debates and analysis of the curriculum (the fragmented stage); to a broadening and more general consensus about the curriculum (the benchmark stage); and finally to concerns about the whether we are really taking a full and realistic view of tourism associated in the classroom with the nature of teaching (the mature stage). At this latter point the concerns of tourism education come more into line with other more established areas of study and the paper consider whether tourism education has now reached maturity. The paper draws mainly on published sources and the author’s own research and experience.</p>

An Examination of the Relationship Between the Temporal and Spatial Organization of a Student's Handwritten Statics Solution and Its Correctness
The purpose of this project is to understand how the organization of a student's solution to a problem relates to the correctness of that work. Understanding this relationship will enable software to provide early warnings and targeted feedback to students who are struggling in a course.  In this study, students in an undergraduate statics course completed their work, including homework, quizzes, and exams, using Livescribe<super>TM<super> Smartpens. These devices record the handwritten solutions as time-stamped pen strokes, enabling the examination of not only the final ink on the page, but also the order in which it was written.  This unique database of student work was used to examine how the history of the solution construction process correlates with the correctness of the work. Solution histories were characterized by a number of quantitative features describing the temporal and spatial organization of the work. For example, some features describe the order in which various problem-solving activities, such as the construction of free body diagrams and equilibrium equations, are performed and others describe the amount of time spent on each activity. The spatial organization of the work is characterized by the extent to which a student revisits earlier parts of a solution to revise his/her work. Cross-validated regression models were constructed using the relaxed lasso method to determine the correlation between these features and student performance. On average, the models explained 43% of the variance in performance. This is a surprising result in that the features do not actually consider the semantic content of the writing. The relaxed lasso method also identified which features were most predictive of problem correctness, thus giving insights into which student behaviors are indicative of high or low performance. For example, revising work long after it was written indicates low performance. While our work has focused on engineering statics, we expect that these techniques will generalize to other domains for which problem solutions include both diagrams and equations.

Advertising Emergency Department Wait Times
Advertising emergency department (ED) wait times has become a common practice in the United States. Proponents of this practice state that it is a powerful marketing strategy that can help steer patients to the ED. Opponents worry about the risk to the public health that arises from a patient with an emergent condition self-triaging to a further hospital, problems with inaccuracy and lack of standard definition of the reported time, and directing lower acuity patients to the higher cost ED setting instead to primary care. Three sample cases demonstrating the pitfalls of advertising ED wait times are discussed. Given the lack of rigorous evidence supporting the practice and potential adverse effects to the public health, caution about its use is advised. West J Emerg Med.

Children’s Travel: Patterns and Influences
Childhood obesity has doubled in the last thirty years. At the same time, youth travel patterns have changed greatly. In 1969 42% of students walked or biked to school; now 13% do. These two trends have caught the attention of policymakers who have identified walking to school as a way to reintroduce physical activity into children’s lives. However, these policies have been made without much knowledge of children’s travel – an area which has been understudied by transportation researchers. This dissertation seeks to fill this knowledge gap and provide information to design better policies by asking three questions: 1) What are the current patterns of children’s travel? 2) What factors have the greatest influence on children’s mode choice for school trips, particularly for walk trips? and 3) How can  land use planning affect walking to school?
      All analyses identify the spatial distribution of students and schools as the primary reason for the low rates of walking to school. For example, in 1969 45% of elementary school students lived less than a mile from their school; today fewer than 24% live within this distance. The simple fact is that most children do not live within a walkable distance of their schools. When children do live close to school, substantial numbers walk. However, current policies aimed at increasing walking to school focus on improving trip safety rather than changing distance to school.
      To encourage large numbers of children to walk to school, planners will need to coordinate land use and school planning. Including children’s distance from school as a planning criterion could be an effective way to change community design and encourage walking. This coordination is most necessary in moderate and high density areas where neighborhood schools are a possibility. However, even in low density areas, planners can optimize school and housing placement so that a large portion of students live within a walkable distance of their school.

Examining Teacher Decision Making in Teaching about the Civil War Era in Middle School Classrooms
This study investigated the influence of teachers' historical perspectives, their beliefs about instructional methods, and the impact of the contextual factors in shaping the enacted curriculum and the instructional methods utilized by three middle school teachers in teaching about the Civil War era.  Data gathered included interviews with teacher-participants, administrators, non-participant teachers, field notes from classroom and school-wide observations, and curricular, departmental, and faculty documents.  These data were analyzed to understand the factors that influenced teacher decision-making regarding their representations of actors and events in the antebellum period, the Civil War, and Reconstruction and their choice of instructional methods.  Analysis of the enacted curriculum indicated significant differences in the three teachers' representations of the antebellum period, the Civil War, and Reconstruction as a result of their varied perspectives on these historical events.  However, the importance of slavery as one cause of the Civil War was evident in all three teachers' accounts of the Civil War.  Analysis of the teachers' decisions regarding instructional methods indicated that all three teachers viewed direct instruction as the most appropriate method for teaching history to their students, although this was also informed by the need to conform to the district's pacing guide for 8th grade history and to convey historical content to their students as efficiently as possible.  In this way the pacing guide, a subtle yet important influence on all three teachers' practice, demonstrated the significance of high stakes accountability as a context that shaped teachers' curricular and instructional decisions.  Main findings include the significance of all three teachers' presentation of the complex nature of Reconstruction as the extension and then denial of rights to African Americans, which served to reinforce the idea that the Civil War was tragic and provided a context to better understand the Civil Rights Movement of the mid twentieth century.  Additionally, all three teachers' use of direct instruction resulted in presenting history as factual and inevitable.  The absence of contingency, the notion that historical events could have had alternative outcomes, represented the history of the Civil War era as part of a preordained narrative of progress.

The effects of teacher perceptions and expectations on student achievement
The achievement gap, the disparity in the academic performance of students, especially in groups of minority students and students of low socioeconomic status in relation to the academic performance of their peers (Abramson, 2006), has been a disturbing reality of our education system since public education's inception in the 1800s. Neither the legal sanctions of Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 nor the more recent 2002 No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act have had the intended impact on closing the achievement gap. A primary barrier to the change necessary for improving education is the low expectations teachers often have toward certain groups of students (Allen, 1999). The purpose of this study was to explore teachers' perceptions and expectations of their Hispanic students. In this qualitative study, transcripts of dialogue from conversations held in professional learning communities were analyzed to discern underlying teachers' beliefs about the majority Hispanic students attending the Arts Magnet K-8 public school. The study found that teachers do have particular perceptions and expectations for their Hispanic students. The researcher also discovered that conversations around race are difficult. The implication is that in order to bring about systemic change in the educational system, educators must acknowledge and be willing to address that their perceptions and expectations can impact a student's academic achievement

Service Quality in Higher Education: the experience of overseas students
<p>The higher education of students has become increasingly internationalised, with an ever-growing proportion of students originating from overseas.  However, research to date suggests that overseas students are often less satisfied with their courses than other students. Consequently, there is a burgeoning need for universities to understand what students value in their university experience. This paper reports on a study that establishes and tests dimensions for measuring service quality in higher education, focusing on full-fee-paying postgraduate students from non-EU countries at one institution in the UK. The institution concerned has a particular reputation in tourism and hospitality and a significant proportion of the respondents were studying these subjects. Adopting Lehtinen and Lehtinen’s 1991 framework, a Q-sort was undertaken followed by factor analysis. The results of the research highlighted four factors of service quality: recognition; quality of instruction and interaction with faculty; sufficiency of resources; and aspects of physical quality. Arguably, the most significant finding here is the importance that these students attach to their institution’s reputation.</p>

Maps : developing critical thinking skills for deaf students in a social studies curriculum
In Deaf classrooms, social studies instruction is usually conveyed via the banking approach instead the inquiry approach leaving students without opportunities to exercise their critical thinking skills. This curriculum addressed this problem by demonstrating how deaf students can be given opportunities to develop and use their critical thinking skills in social studies content using maps. Learning activities in this curriculum designed with the following four goals in mind; support students in developing their critical thinking skills, foster students' skills in reading, interpreting, and using maps, develop and use academic language associated with maps in both ASL and English, and encourage students to use the inquiry approach as a learning strategy. This curriculum was field tested at a school for the deaf in a 5th grade classroom with seven deaf and hard of hearing students. Field notes, artifacts, and lesson assessments were used to evaluate the outcomes of the curriculum to determine whether if it was a success. The evaluation indicates that the curricular goals were successfully met. Students showed an effort to use their critical thinking skills while interacting with maps and associated graphical organizers and at the same time used academic language in both ASL and English. They also showed usage of the inquiry approach in seeking knowledge in the content area addressed

This study looks at a culture within a culture focusing on military dependent high school students at risk of not completing high school, what occurs when the psychosocial stressors due to high mobility and other family dynamics impact adolescent children, and what role alternative education programs may play in mitigating educational challenges and family life stressors. A review of the literature speaks to the high mobility, academic challenges, and psychosocial stressors unique to military dependent populations, as well as the various alternative independent study models explored. Emphasizing student- centered appreciative inquiry, the study employs a qualitative embedded design within a single case study with a focus on the relationship between military dependent students at-risk for dropping out of high school and independent study alternative educational programs at multiple freestanding and traditional school campuses. Both students and teachers were interviewed. Additionally, students were asked to respond to three quick-write questions. Data supporting the self-perception of academic and psychosocial success from a student/teacher perspective were analyzed to look at changes in course completion, appropriate age/grade level remediation, tracking for timely graduation, post high school plans, changes in family dynamics, and changes in attitudes about school and self- worth

Collaboration in Action was designed to facilitate a learning environment that would increase motivation and engagement among students in ninth grade English classroom. The model that was used was based on the structure used in scholastic journalism, which required the participating students to be teachers, learners and collaborators. The curriculum was implemented in a ninth grade English classroom at a Title I high school. Prior to the implementation, the class average was in the D+ range. Collaboration in Action was used alongside a novel study. The students were grouped based on skills and social interactions and expected to work together to complete tasks. The students were reliant on one another to complete tasks and turn in assignments, in order for their groups to succeed. It was critical for the students to monitor and manage one another's progress. Through this curriculum, it was found that by placing students in structured, collaborative learning environments, they were more likely to be engaged in their material, than when in a traditional classroom environment. Creating a structure in which students had to rely on one another made each student feel personally responsible for the success of his /her peers. Collaboration in Action facilitated a sense of belonging, ownership and community for students that helped them feel supported. Through Collaboration in Action, teachers can borrow from the successful practices of the journalism classroom. Despite the unique nature of scholastic journalism, the structures that are used in electives can garner meaningful results in the core subject areas as well

Angus E. Taylor: UCSC Chancellorship, 1976-1977
The Regional History Project conducted three interviews with former Chancellor Angus E. Taylor on January 28-30, 1997. Taylor was appointed the campus's third chancellor in February, 1976, by UC President David S. Saxon during a difficult period in UCSC's history, when the campus's second chancellor, Mark N. Christensen, resigned amidst controversy after a tenure of barely 18 months. Saxon asked Taylor to assume the chancellorship and to stabilize the young campus while a permanent chancellor was selected.
      Prior to his appointment, Taylor was a professor of mathematics at UCLA from 1938 to 1966; and served in the UC systemwide administration as vice president for academic affairs from 1965 to 1970, and as University Provost from 1970 to 1975. He was a seasoned veteran of the University and its unique system of shared governance; he knew the workings of the academic senate and University policies inside out and was well acquainted with the key figures in the University's administration, all of which stood him in good stead when he became chancellor at UCSC.
      Taylor begins his narration with the story of his early life and family history, and his years at Harvard College. He then describes the background leading to his appointment as chancellor of UCSC in 1976. Interspersed throughout his narration are comments on many aspects of his experiences as both teacher and administrator in the UC system (his participation in avoiding a confrontation between the UC Regents and the faculty during the Free Speech Movement at UC Berkeley and his comments on the history of affirmative action in the University) which influenced his approach to UCSC.
      He discusses the campus's most pressing problems and how he addressed them-the management and organization of the chancellor's office; interaction with divisional deans and college provosts; faculty recruitment; budget allocations and the budget process; and a serious decline in enrollment. Applications to the campus were down by over 22% in 1975, and had been declining for five years.
      Addressing declining enrollment was his first order of business and in his opinion proved to be the most significant and difficult problem of his tenure. He made a careful analysis of the admissions office situation, aided by the Stanford committee (appointed by President Saxon), which resulted in the difficult political decision to dismiss the controversial director of enrollment, Roberto Rubalcava. He then reorganized the admissions office and created a new position, vice chancellor of student affairs, to oversee this important campus function.
      Taylor addresses the major issues he faced in his efforts to stabilize the campus, including the relationship of colleges and boards of studies, the campus budget, reorganizing the chancellor's office and setting up various committees which improved communication among campus administrators, fundraising, town/gown relations, the role of the colleges, and completing the campus's academic plan. During his tenure he faced two major student political demonstrations-- the first protesting his handling of the Rubalcava affair and then protests over South African apartheid and the University-wide divestiture movement, which pressured the University to sell off its stock holdings in companies doing business with South Africa. He discusses his approach to student trespassing and law-breaking and how his solution (he declined to encourage prosecution) met with some disapproval from administrators at other universities who thought Taylor was setting a poor precedent. He also reflects on the mission of the University of California, his thoughts on affirmative action, the search for a new UCSC chancellor, and his relations with University Hall and with President Saxon.

Long-term English learner experiences : discovering pathways to success
The pervasive gap in achievement between minority and nonminority students is an issue of national importance. Addressing the needs of teachers of minority students, specifically Latino English learners, has received some-- but not sufficient--attention in professional development research. The research regarding teaching practices toward minority students highlights the deficit views and low expectations held by teachers; however, this is seldom accounted for in the development of reform or in the design and outcomes of professional development of teachers of minority and language-minority students. The greatest impact of teacher practices toward minority and language-minority students is how these students experience schooling, in particular how and if they experience success. This student voice research serves as a contributing component toward reform as it presents the barriers and supports that long-term English learners (LTEL) experience. The findings from this study serve to generate a framework of factors that lead to success as revealed by LTEL students. The study's implications are pertinent to school leaders, classroom teachers, and professional development providers. The study suggests areas for future research in student voice

Training discriminative computer vision models with weak supervision
Statistical machine learning techniques have transformed computer vision research in the last two decades, and have led to many breakthroughs in object detection, recognition and tracking. Such data-driven methods extrapolate rules from a set of labeled examples, freeing us from designing and tuning a system by hand for a particular application or domain. Discriminative learning methods, which directly learn to differentiate categories of data rather than modeling the data itself, have been shown to be particularly effective. However, the requirement of a large set of labeled examples becomes prohibitively expensive, especially if we consider scaling to a wide range of domains and applications. In this dissertation we explore weakly supervised methods of training discriminative models for a number of computer vision applications. These methods require weaker forms of annotation that are easier and/or cheaper to obtain, and can learn in situations where the ground truth is inherently ambiguous. Many of the algorithms in this dissertation are based on a particular form of weakly supervised learning called Multiple Instance Learning (MIL). Our final contribution is a theoretical analysis of MIL that takes into account the characteristics of applications in computer vision and related areas

The Impact of Working with Medical Students on Resident Productivity in the Emergency Department
Introduction: Academic emergency departments (ED) strive to balance educational needs of residents and medical students with service requirements that optimize patient care. No study to date has evaluated whether resident precepting of medical students affects residents’ clinical productivity. Understanding the interplay of these variables may allow for ED staffing that maximizes productivity. We sought to determine whether the precepting of medical students impacts resident productivity.Methods: This study was performed at a tertiary care ED with a 70,000 annual patient census. We performed a computer-based (Verinet Systems, Alachua, Fl) retrospective review of patient encounters initiated by second- and third-year emergency medicine residents (PGY2 and PGY3) assigned to medical student precepting shifts and compared these shifts with those of the same residents when not working with students. Data collection over 12 months included shift length from the monthly schedule and number of patients and relative value units (RVUs) from the Verinet System. Patients seen per hour (pt/hr) and relative value unit per hour (RVUs/hr) were calculated. We compared parameters using two-tailed T-tests. The hospital’s institutional review board approved this study.Results: Daily census was 202 on days without medical student rotators and 200 on days with student rotators (P = 0.29). While precepting students, PGY3s saw 1.40 pt/hr versus 1.39 pt/hr without students (P = 0.88) and PGY2s saw 1.28 pt/hr with students compared to 1.28 pt/hr without students (P = 0.94). PGY3s generated 3.97 RVU/hr with students and 4.03 RVU/hr while working independently (P = 0.68) and PGY2s generated 3.82 RVU/hr working with students versus 3.74 RVU/hr without (P = 0.44). There were no productivity differences between resident precepting shifts and regular shifts.Conclusion: In this study, resident productivity was not affected by precepting medical students.

However, it is unclear <italic>how</italic> these factors interact&mdash;as well as <italic>why</italic> they play a role&mdash;in lexical learning.  Through a set of four experiments, this research demonstrated that neither mental imagery nor embodied action directly promotes the acquisition of second language (L2) words.  The results of a fifth experiment provide evidence that both mental imagery and embodied action enhance ASL sign acquisition through enactment.  Taken together, these results indicate that the body plays a more pivotal role in the early stages of sign acquisition than it does in the early stages of spoken L2 word learning.  Overall, the results provide some support for embodied theories of language acquisition and processing and indicate that the saliency of perceptual experiences underlying lexical items and their referents depends on modality of communication.

This paper provides an in-depth analysis of the current issues that affect lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) students of color. Specifically, this research addresses the academic persistence and multiple identities of LGB Latino/a students. The stories captured in this study explores the lives of these unique individuals and how advocating for and creating a positive campus climate on university campuses for LGB students of color generates opportunities for these students to feel safe and comfortable with themselves. LGB Latino/a students, when given the opportunity for increased autonomy in their racial/ethnic and sexual identities, demonstrate healthy and positive lifestyles. LGB students of color afforded with the proper education allow them to explore various identities by having access to the array of resources offered on a university campus. This research can assist university personnel, educators, and advocates for LGB Latino/a students as a tool to better serve this underrepresented population with their multiple identities and learn to understand the cultural aspect that affects LGB students of color with their sexual identity

Homeless education : supporting student and family resilience in the face of poverty hardship
In 2005-2006, close to one million homeless children in our nation faced unprecedented challenges trying to access and succeed in public schools. Fortunately, legislation was enacted to support this special needs population. The types of support mentioned in the McKinney-Vento Act include: transportation to and from school, immediate enrollment in school, and access to supplemental programs and school activities. Research on homeless education identify barriers students encounter and suggestions for effective policy and strategies to support them; however, there is a gap in the literature in terms of research identifying effective program components that might facilitate academic success. The literature on resilience identifies protective components that seem to project children facing adversity onto positive pathways such as, forming meaningful relationships, creating a caring environment, creating a sense of belonging, developing community involvement in school, and developing positive family relationships. This dissertation addresses the gaps in literature by exploring the components of district McKinney-Vento programs serving more than 1,000 homeless students and identifies risk factors that exist in school districts with McKinney-Vento programs. Finally, this study documents protective components that exist in McKinney-Vento programs as well as the unique components that exist in programs with a higher percentage of homeless children scoring proficient on the Language Arts (LA) portion of California's Standardized Testing and Reporting (STAR) test. The goal of this study is to inform school leaders about effective strategies and policies that promote resilience and success in education for students living in poverty and experiencing homelessness. This study finds that district McKinney-Vento programs show evidence of facilitating academic success for homeless students. Components found include the components those identified in resilience literature and are specifically connected to addressing students' socio- emotional, basic and academic needs. Similarly risk factors were identified in all six districts and can be compared to those cited in homeless and resilience literature. Duration of the program also diminished risks and increased positive outcomes. The districts with the greatest academic success as measured by the LA portion of the STAR showed the most evidence of creating positive family connections and focusing on student and family strengths

Exploring English Language Learners (ELL) Experiences with Scientific Language and Inquiry within a Real Life Context
Abstract Exploring English Language Learners (ELL) Experiences with Scientific Language and Inquiry within a Real Life Context                                          Lisa M. Algee  English Language Learners (ELL) are often at a distinct disadvantage from receiving authentic science learning opportunites. This study explored English Language Learners (ELL) learning experiences with scientific language and inquiry within a real life context.  This research was theoretically informed by sociocultural theory and literature on student learning and science teaching for ELL.  A qualitative, case study was used to explore students' learning experiences.  Data from multiple sources was collected:  student interviews, science letters, an assessment in another context, field-notes, student presentations, inquiry assessment, instructional group conversations, parent interviews, parent letters, parent homework, teacher-researcher evaluation, teacher-researcher reflective journal, and student ratings of learning activities.  These data sources informed the following research questions: (1) Does participation in an out-of-school contextualized inquiry science project increase ELL use of scientific language? (2) Does participation in an out-of-school contextualized inquiry science project increase ELL understanding of scientific inquiry and their motivation to learn?  (3) What are parents' funds of knowledge about the local ecology and does this inform students' experiences in the science project?  All data sources concerning students were analyzed for similar patterns and trends and triangulation was sought through the use of these data sources.  The remaining data sources concerning the teacher-researcher were used to inform and assess whether the pedagogical and research practices were in alignment with the proposed theoretical framework.  Data sources concerning parental participation accessed funds of knowledge, which informed the curriculum in order to create continuity and connections between home and school.  To ensure accuracy in the researchers' interpretations of student and parent responses during interviews, member checking was employed.  The findings suggest that participation in an out-of-school contextualized inquiry science project increased ELL use of scientific language and understanding of scientific inquiry and motivation to learn.  In addition, parent' funds of knowledge informed students' experiences in the science project.  These findings suggest that the learning and teaching practices and the real life experiential learning contexts served as an effective means for increasing students' understandings and motivation to learn.

Resegmenting assimilation : analyzing second generation education from a binational perspective
This thesis analyzes the educational aspirations and outcomes among people associated with Tlacuitapa, a small Mexican town with a long history of immigration to the United States. Second generation Tlacuitapenses raised and educated in the United States are compared to similarly aged co-ethnics who grew up in the origin community. Results indicate that Tlacuitapenses set high educational goals for themselves regardless of where they live, though aspirations are slightly higher in the United States. However, despite having similar educational goals as their counterparts in Mexico, respondents educated north of the border finish far more years of school even when controlling for age and parents' education. Follow-up interviews isolate two features of the Tlacuitapa community in the United States that explain this variation. First, high documentation and employment rates among immigrant parents from Tlacuitapa create favorable economic conditions that provide educational opportunities for their children. Second, much of the Tlacuitapa second generation participates in "safe harbors" - high school programs that facilitate student enrollment and advancement. The term "Tlacuitapense exceptionalism" is used to describe the relative economic and legal stability of the Tlacuitapense immigrant generation and the comparatively high college participation and completion rates of the second generation. This exceptionalism challenges the causal mechanisms that undergird the downward assimilation model proposed by Portes and Zhou, who do not consider several key determinants of educational success in articulating segmented assimilation theory. The thesis calls for a "resegmentation" of assimilation theory with a stronger focus on class and documentation distinctions.\

Two Principals in a Policy Environment: Beliefs and Behaviors Concerning Their Role in Instruction
Two Principals in a Policy Environment: Beliefs and Behaviors Concerning Their Role in InstructionInstructional leadership is one of the most frequently discussed educational leadership doctrines, yet the definition of the concept remains imprecise.  This comparative ethnography of two suburban elementary schools develops the precision of the term through consideration of the practice of two particular elementary school principals. The study explores principal beliefs and behaviors in regard to their role in instruction within the school organization.This interpretive research concluded that these two principals constantly navigated between the institutionalized organizational influences of what it meant to be the principal of a US public elementary school and the local cultural and micropolitical demands placed on their roles as building administrators. These findings revealed that internal local sociocultural influences carried importance even though the two schools appeared to be similar to one another in demographic and socioeconomic factors.  This study found that not only were principals working with a set of formal organizational goals related to teaching and learning, but they were also forced to respond to a different set of instrumental organizational goals necessary to keep the school functioning. In answering to these competing demands, the principals responded in two ways - they used their organizational positioning of the principal within the school and they each drew on different constructs of authority with differing degrees of effectiveness. The positioning of the principal within the organization and the ways in which the principals operationalized their authority within the school produced real as well as formal authority, thus impacting their capacity to influence others. Authority constructs defined primarily by principals' competence (expertise and experience) more effectively influenced teachers and thus the attainment of formal and instrumental goals than constructs defined primarily by positional power (hierarchy within the organization) and authority of person (social/human relations with teachers). This study presented an initial inquiry into the convergence of authority structures and instructional leadership.  Additional empirical research will support the efficacy of the use of authority structures by principals to influence teachers and cultivate attainment of formal goals and thus improvement in pedagogical practice.

Identifying with Mathematics : the effects of conceptual understanding, motivation, and communication on the creation of a strong mathematical identity
Many students struggle with understanding the importance of higher-level mathematics to their lives and rarely identify with the math they engage in. In order for students to identify with math, or see themselves as learners of mathematics, it is important to provide students with a curriculum that addresses conceptual understanding, motivation, and communication. Identifying with Mathematics was developed for educators to help students identify with math through investigation, communication, peer discussions, a meaningful project, and student reflections. There were three goals of Identifying with Mathematics. The first goal was to help students see the relationship between mathematics and the real world while increasing their ability to solve problems. The second goal focused on creating a classroom environment that facilitated communication and allowed students to effectively use academic language through meaningful peer discussions. The third goal was for students to create a strong mathematical identity by combining strategies that build conceptual understanding, motivation, and communication. Identifying with Mathematics was implemented in a ninth-grade geometry classroom. Data from interviews, student surveys, student reflections, investigative lessons, a project, and field notes were analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of the curriculum. The results indicate that students' perceptions of themselves as learners of mathematics became stronger. Students gained self-confidence while participation and motivation levels increased. In addition, students increased their use of academic language during classroom discussions and exhibited high-quality work in their projects. Overall, students' mathematical identities became stronger as a result of a curriculum that empowered student to take charge of their education

Like many educators in the field of Deaf Education, improving literacy is an area of high interest. This curriculum addresses more explicit instruction on how to use what deaf and hard-of-hearing students already know in ASL, and help them apply it towards their written English. Students were given the opportunity to practice free expression in ASL on video, followed by writing an English equivalent. Based on these samples of self-expression, the teacher made positive comparisons between English and ASL in order to build upon and strengthen both languages. Throughout the implementation, students demonstrated that they were using metacognitive skills in order to differentiate between English and ASL, and were even able to develop their own methods after being provided with scaffolded instruction

The Impact of Working with Medical Students on  Resident Prouctivity in the Emergency Department
Introduction: Academic emergency departments (ED) strive to balance educational needs of residents and medical students with service requirements that optimize patient care. No study to date has evaluated whether resident precepting of medical students affects residents’ clinical productivity. Understanding the interplay of these variables may allow for ED staffing that maximizes productivity. We sought to determine whether the precepting of medical students impacts resident productivity.
      Methods: This study was performed at a tertiary care ED with a 70,000 annual patient census. We performed a computer-based (Verinet Systems, Alachua, Fl) retrospective review of patient encounters initiated by second- and third-year emergency medicine residents (PGY2 and PGY3) assigned to medical student precepting shifts and compared these shifts with those of the same residents when not working with students. Data collection over 12 months included shift length from the monthly schedule and number of patients and relative value units (RVUs) from the Verinet System. Patients seen per hour (pt/hr) and relative value unit per hour (RVUs/hr) were calculated. We compared parameters using two-tailed T-tests. The hospital’s institutional review board approved this study.
      Results: Daily census was 202 on days without medical student rotators and 200 on days with student rotators (P = 0.29). While precepting students, PGY3s saw 1.40 pt/hr versus 1.39 pt/hr without students (P = 0.88) and PGY2s saw 1.28 pt/hr with students compared to 1.28 pt/hr without students (P = 0.94). PGY3s generated 3.97 RVU/hr with students and 4.03 RVU/hr while working independently (P = 0.68) and PGY2s generated 3.82 RVU/hr working with students versus 3.74 RVU/hr without (P = 0.44). There were no productivity differences between resident precepting shifts and regular shifts.
      Conclusion: In this study, resident productivity was not affected by precepting medical students. West J Emerg Med.

Learning to change, changing to learn : district conditions for organizational learning
A mixed method study was performed to investigate the district and school conditions that cultivate organizational learning, and how that influences the district's response to a 21st Century change initiative. The interdisciplinary approach of the study explored the relationship between potential conditions for sustainable change by drawing on three bodies of literature: districts, organizational learning, and transformational leadership. A literature review of the theoretical foundations, and past research within each field, is provided. The mixed method study included a quantitative phase in which data was collected from an Organizational Learning Conditions survey, and an extant data source. A qualitative phase explored findings obtained through semi-structured private interviews of district and school leaders, teachers, and union members. Document and archival analysis provided additional data for the qualitative phase. The mixed method research design was intended to obtain a deep understanding of what is happening in the district of study with regard to the presence of the conditions for organizational learning, and how those conditions enabled or constrained the adoption of a 21st Century literacy change initiative. Data clearly revealed the presence of four conditions for organizational learning: (a) Collaborative and Harmonious Culture, (b) Congruence of District Mission & Vision with Practices and Beliefs, (c) Leadership, and (d) Policies and Resources for Promoting Learning. A fifth condition, Organizational Communication, emerged through the content analysis of stakeholder interviews and archival data. The district stakeholder's response to a 21st Century change initiative was primarily enabled by the influence of the organizational learning conditions. However, Culture was found to both enable and constrain the stakeholder response. The implications of this study suggest that districts considering the implementation of a 21st Century literacy initiative first inventory the existing conditions and available resources; then build or leverage the communication channels to enlist stakeholder participation in the design and scaffolding of the initiative; and finally, the implementation action should be enacted with shared stakeholder purpose and responsibility

Percent Plans in College Admissions: A Comparative Analysis of Three States’ Experiences
Our public schools are becoming increasingly segregated by race and income and the segregated schools are, on average, strikingly inferior in many important ways, including the quality and experience of teachers and the level of competition from other students. Given these facts, it is clear that students of different races do not receive an equal chance for college.

Teacher profiles and high school mathematics achievement: What do we know about the teachers of Latino and ELL high school students?
<bold>AbstractTeacher Profiles and High School Mathematics Achievement: What Do We Know About the Teachers of Latino and ELL High School Students?</bold>Angela ThompsonEducational researchers have long sought to identify, measure, and explain the pathways to becoming a high-quality teacher, but specifying the precise admixture of preparation, knowledge, and policies remains elusive. Few studies link teacher qualities to student achievement, despite state and national calls for teacher accountability of their students' test scores (Guarino, Hamilton, Lockwood, &amp; Rathbun 2006). Analyzing the characteristics of mathematics teachers whose students are achieving may help to diminish the long-standing opportunity gap in US schools between the large population of underserved students and those of the dominant culture and language. The persistent underperformance of Latino students, many of whom are also English Language Learners, is of particular concern. The present study explored the qualities of teachers whose Latino and ELL students achieve in mathematics, and was guided by the following research questions: a) what are the characteristics of prevailing profiles of US 10<super>th</super> grade mathematics teachers; b) what are the predominant characteristics of students who are assigned to 10<super>th</super>  grade mathematics teacher profiles; c) which teacher profiles, if any, are more likely to have Latinos or ELLs; and d) what combinations of matching students with teachers might predict better success for Latinos and ELLs in high school mathematics?Using the ELS 2002&ndash;2004 longitudinal data set, a cluster analysis revealed five groups of teachers by their survey responses within a data set of over 4000 mathematics teachers. Results indicate that teachers whose students perform best in mathematics are primarily White, female, highly educated, regularly certified, and have many years of experience. Latinos and ELLs are significantly more likely to have newer, alternatively certified teachers who are Latinos themselves. For Latino and ELL students who scored well in mathematics, these newer, seemingly less prepared teachers may be best for them, but only if students are enrolled in high-tracked rigorous courses.The results suggest more than one model of a high&ndash;quality teacher. Teachers should be highly educated in mathematics, but also highly prepared to teach special populations of students and to use the most recent technology in pedagogically appropriate ways. More importantly, students not enrolled in high-tracked, honors, AP, or college preparatory courses struggle in mathematics, regardless of their teachers' background or preparation.

Evaluation of the California Safe Routes to School Construction Program
This report describes the progress made from April, 2002 through January, 2003 in the UC-Irvine evaluation of the California Safe Routes to School construction program. The UC-Irvine research is a pre- and post-evaluation of selected California SR2S sites to determine the effectiveness of physical changes to the local environment in (1) improving the perceived and actual safety of the walk and bicycle trip to school, and (2) enhancing the viability of the walking and bicycling environment. The goal of the research is to assess the impact of the SR2S construction program on pedestrian, bicyclist, and motorist behavior tied to safety, perceived safety, and the amount of non-motorized travel to and from school sites participating in the SR2S program.
      This report describes the selection of sixteen school sites, the methods use to collect data at those school sites, and an initial description of the data at the first twelve schools included in this research.

Making the margin visible : out-of -school literacy practices among Mexican heritage English learners in an English-only district
The Hispanic academic achievement gap in California is often attributed to language difference, low economic status, and assumed cultural deficit within families (Neufeld & Fitzgerald, 2001; Saracho, 2007). When students who fit these descriptors achieve academic scores of proficiency and above, we can benefit from examining their repertoires of family literacy practices. This qualitative study examined the summer literacy practices within the nine Spanish-speaking families of a second grade cohort attending a small Title 1 urban school in Southern California. At home adult support was in Spanish, and material means were limited by low-income status, yet six of the nine achieved above average on state tests in English. In this descriptive, two-phase study I used semi- structured interviews and video elicitation to answer these questions: 1. What do Mexican-heritage children do during the summer vacation? 2. What funds of literacy are available to them? 3. How do home and community ecological and cultural- linguistic contexts influence their engagement with these funds of literacy? The goal was to identify patterns of literacy engagement with local resources as they emerged through daily family routines within an apparently homogeneous sample. I used the framework of ecocultural activity settings to capture literacy events involving adults and children in their naturalistic settings. Inductive analysis of multiple data sources revealed a wide range of practices and an abundance of literacy resources within each home. Four of the six higher achieving children were found to be involved in church or bible study community activities that required literacy in Spanish. Adults in these cases provided structure and engagement to summer practices, with the purpose of moral education. In two of the cases fathers were the dominant agents of literacy. In all cases older siblings mediated practices in English. These findings complicate the deficit assumptions associated with low-income, linguistic minorities by providing illustrating how families leverage local funds of literacy to support their children's overall literacy development. The study claims the need for a new framework of literacy research that integrates the role out-of-school literacy activities in overall literacy development, and the need to acknowledge the literacy resources Mexican-heritage students bring to the classroom

The Impact on Emergency Department Visits for Respiratory Illness During the Southern California Wildfires
Introduction: In 2007 wildfires ravaged Southern California resulting in the largest evacuation due to a wildfire in American history. We report how these wildfires affected emergency department (ED) visits for respiratory illness. 
      
         Methods: We extracted data from a Kaiser Permanente database for a single metropolitan community ED. We compared the number of visits due to respiratory illness at t ime intervals of 2 weeks before and during the time when the fires were burnin g. We counted the total number of patients with chief complaint of dyspnea, cough, and asthma and final international classification of disease 9 coding diagnosis of asthma, bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and respiratory syndrome, and analyzed data for both total number and proportion of ED visits. We evaluated the data using Early Aberration Reporting System software to determine significant single-visit increases compared to expected counts. We also analyzed the average length of ED stay. Data on air quality were extracted from the http:// www.airnow.gov site. 
      
         Results: There were significant differences between pre-fire and fire period average visit counts for the chief complaints of dyspnea and asthma. Dypnea complaints increased by 3.2 visits per day. During the fire the diagnoses of asthma increased significantly by 2.6 patients per day. Air quality reached air quality index values of 300, indicating very unhealthy conditions. Average ED length of stay times remained unchanged during the fire period compared to the pre-fire period.
      
         Conclusion: The 2007 Southern California wildfires caused significant surges in the volume of ED patients seeking treatment for respiratory illness. Disaster plans should prepare for these surges when future wildfires occur. West J Emerg Med 2013;14(2):79-84.

Financing College in Hard Times: Work and Student Aid
These are the third in a series of reports exploring the impact of California's fiscal crisis on the opportunities for underrepresented students in the California State University system. Although the Master Plan for Higher Education called for tuition-free affordable college for all qualified California students, the fiscal reality of California has led to the abandonment of that promise and rapidly rising tuition and other costs of college. Over the last decade, the California State University (CSU) has sustained a substantial decrease in state general funds and has offset these decreases by increasing tuition and fees by over 166 percent. In 1967 the state paid approximately 90% of a student’s education while today it pays approximately 64%. As costs associated with college rise for students, including housing and books, attending and financing college may become too difficult for students with the greatest financial need, the reports find, particularly the state’s majority of Latino and African American youth.    Related Documents    Financing College in Hard Times
      
      
         The first study, by San Jose State University Professor Amy Leisenring, says that due to rising college costs and budget cuts, 86% of students surveyed in the study work for pay while in college, with underrepresented minority students comprising a large majority of students who work while in college.  Leisenring’s study explores the impact of recent budget cuts on Latino, African American and American Indian students, their views on tuition/fee increases and the affects of working in paid employment on their academic success.  
            Higher Tuition, More Work, and Academic Harm:  An Examination of the Impact of Tuition Hikes on the Employment Experiences of Under-represented Minority Students at one CSU campus
          is based on survey data of 163 underrepresented minority students (URM), as well as in-depth interviews with 16 URM students.
      
         The second study, by UCLA Professor Jose Luis Santos, explored the SUG, its effects on underrepresented students, and trends over a 20-year period with inflation. Santos reported that middle-income students are becoming the casualties of fee increases because while the middle-income families are seeing an increase in SUG awards, it isn't enough to keep up with the rising cost of tuition. On the other hand, the lowest income groups have seen a proportional decrease, the report states. The study also finds that students who did not qualify for state or federal financial aid have benefitted the most from SUG.
      By reviewing the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study from 2008 and other publicly available data from the CSU system and the California Postsecondary Education Commission, Santos’ study, 
            The State University Grant Program and Its Effects on Underrepresented Students at the CSU
         , explains that SUG helps to mitigate fee increases, regardless of race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and/or institution attended. The study asserts that SUG only acts to offset fee increases, and instead should become a more targeted, need-based aid program to assist the most underrepresented and neediest students.
      These reports are the third in a series called, THE CSU CRISIS AND CALIFORNIA’S FUTURE, and are designed to analyze the impact of the fiscal cutbacks on opportunity for higher education in the California State University system.  The first report, Squeezed from all Sides documented the struggle of many students to continue their education in the face of soaring tuition, diminished offerings, and a financial crisis seriously hurting them and many of their family members. The students reported essential classes disappearing, rising financial barriers and large delays in finishing their studies. The second reports explored faculty experiences under budget cuts and their inability to deliver the kind of quality education they believe CSU students deserve and need to obtain gainful employment after college.

Implementation of a Multi-Tiered Support System in Schools
This study evaluated the properties of a 37-item survey designed to measure a school's implementation of a multi-tiered support system (MTSS).  Twenty-four elementary schools from one urban school district participated in the study and were grouped based on assigned level of implementation.  Survey responses were collected from 148 different staff members.  Internal consistency was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha which equaled 0.981, 95% CI 0.975, 0.986.  Interrater agreement, as measured by average measure intraclass correlation (ICC), was 0.979, 95% CI 0.973, 0.985 across all schools and raters.  An ANOVA comparing the mean survey score total across groups did not reveal any significant differences F (2, 96) = 0.41, p =0 .67, nor were there any significant correlations between survey score totals and student outcomes as measured by AIMSweb.  Reliability of the survey was strong, but further refinement is needed to improve the survey's ability to discriminate between implementation levels.

The Arizona Home Language Survey and the Identification of Students for ELL Services
Assuring that English language learners (ELLs) receive the services to which they have a right requires accurately identifying those students. Virtually all states identify ELLs in a two-step process: First, parents fill out a home language survey; second, students in whose homes a language other than English is spoken and who therefore might be less than fully proficient in English, are tested for English language proficiency. The home language survey thus plays a gatekeeping role. If it fails to identify potential ELLs, there is a greatly reduced chance these students will be identified and receive services to which they are entitled. The two studies reported in this paper are not about what services ELLs need or receive but only about the process whereby potential ELLs are identified so that they might be tested then receive services if they qualify. More specifically, it addresses the question of whether Arizona's sharp reduction in the home language survey questions can lead to failure to identify students who, by the state's own criterion (i.e., performance on the AZELLA), are entitled to those services. Analyses of data from two Arizona school districts clearly show that use of a single home language survey question will under-identify students. Based on data from these two districts, as many as 11 to 18% of students who are eligible for ELL designation could be denied services to which they are entitled if a single home language survey question is used to identify potential ELLs. Further, it is highly unlikely that a fail safe mechanism established by the state, whereby teachers can nominate potential ELLs for language testing, will in fact successfully identify most students the new procedure fails to identify.

The Education of English Language Learners in Arizona: A Legacy of Persisting Achievement Gaps in a Restrictive Language Policy Climate
This report reviews achievement gaps in both reading and math between ELL and non-ELL students in Arizona over the post-Proposition 203 period 2005-2009 and during the first year of implementation of the 4 hour ELD block, 2008-09. The study finds that Arizona has made little to no progress in closing the achievement gap between ELL and non-ELL students during this period. It also compares achievement gaps in reading and math over the same period between Arizona and Utah and Washington DC, two educational entities with vastly different spending policies. Here, the study argues that, notwithstanding changes in tests and proficiency thresholds in the states over this period of time, the relative position of Arizona vis-a-vis these comparison entities remains very similar, with Arizona continuing to lag behind both in percent of ELL students achieving proficiency in reading and math. The study concludes that Arizona is on the wrong path for closing achievement gaps for its ELL students and that this is due, at least in part, to its highly restrictive language instruction policies.

Student Interviews: 1969, Volume II
A series of interviews with twelve members of the first four-year graduating class at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Among the twelve were two students who had been interviewed in 1967 and four who had transferred into the class at the junior level. As in the 1967 series, the students were asked to comment on the strengths and weaknesses of the University, administration, faculty, classes, and general campus life. This they did very candidly. By happenstance, the interviews were scheduled over a two-week period that included the campus's first serious student strike and first building takeover. Thus the interviews tend to give the anatomy of the student strike as it developed. The philosophy of the students interviewed ranged from conservative to radical and their participation in the strike ranged from inactivity to leadership roles in the strike organization.

The Hopwood Decision in Texas as an Attack on Latino Access to Selective Higher Education Programs
This paper begins with a review of the Hopwood decision which has prohibited Texas colleges and universities from making any consideration of race or Latino origin in admissions or financial aid decisions. One of the immediate effects of the Hopwood decision was to decrease the number of Latino students who applied and were admitted to many of the most selective publicly-funded higher education programs in the state. The amount of financial aid available to Latino students was also drastically decreased because of Hopwood. The next section of the paper argues that the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, the Texas Legislature and the top administrators in the public higher education systems have taken actions that can be seen as largely supportive of increasing Latino access despite Hopwood. Public opinion is generally supportive of diversity but critical of racial preferences. The paper concludes that the strongest opposition to Latino access is found in the legal establishment; i.e., the courts, the Texas Attorney General and some law school faculty.

Let's Stay Together: A Case for Special Education Teacher Retention
The goal of this study is to identify those factors contributing to special education teacher (SET) turnover that can be directly amendable to intervention by the improved policy and practice at school sites.  This study examines the turnover behavior of SETs by including variables clustered as teacher demographics, employment factors, and teacher perceptions of organizational conditions.  The responses of SET stayers (teachers who remain on their school from the base year to year two of the survey), movers (teachers who moved from one school to another), and leavers (teachers who left the teaching profession) were compared to general education teachers (GET) in the same groups to identify variables that separated the subgroups. The data for this research are the teacher reports contained in the Teacher Follow-up Survey (TFS) 2000-2001.  This survey is the complement to the Public and Private School Teacher Questionnaire of the School and Staffing Survey (SASS, 1999-2000).  These surveys are sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education and were conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.  They were analyzed by the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES).  The teacher samples are weighted to produce national estimates.  The sample of this study is 4,048 SETs and GETs (N = 4,080 weighted).                   This study is unique to others whose focus is SET turnover in that it examines the distinct roles of elementary and secondary SETs.  The school levels differ in school organization, academic rigor, and special education law.  This study found that these differences appear to have an impact on retention behavior.

Empathy in Inquiry : supporting middle school science students in developing empathy through group reflections during guided inquiry
Most recent research on science education finds that inquiry-based learning in the middle-school science classroom is the most effective method in preparing students to think critically about scientific concepts. While research has demonstrated the beneficial effects on conceptual understanding for students who learn through inquiry-based methods of instruction at the middle school level, not much research has been done on how inquiry- based learning affects students' empathy, or students' ability to identify with and understand the situation, feelings, and motives of their peers. This research investigates how inquiry based learning can be used to increase students' understanding of what their peers think, why their peers have the views that they do and how these understandings contribute to science learning. The students participating in this study took part in a curriculum entitled What's Your Idea? where they reflected on group processes during a guided inquiry investigation. Participating students generally increased their empathy towards their peers and were likely to use the ideas of their peers during the investigation. This finding implies that inquiry-based learning provides benefits other than conceptual understandings for middle school students

Advertising Emergency Department Wait Times
Advertising emergency department (ED) wait times has become a common practice in the United States. Proponents of this practice state that it is a powerful marketing strategy that can help steer patients to the ED. Opponents worry about the risk to the public health that arises from a patient with an emergent condition self-triaging to a further hospital, problems with inaccuracy and lack of standard definition of the reported time, and directing lower acuity patients to the higher cost ED setting instead to primary care. Three sample cases demonstrating the pitfalls of advertising ED wait times are discussed. Given the lack of rigorous evidence supporting the practice and potential adverse effects to the public health, caution about its use is advised. West J Emerg Med 2013;14(2):77-78.

Tapping on the glass : the intersection of leadership and gender in independent school administration
While independent schools are a small sector of the American school system, they educate a significant cross section of society. Creating equitable models of leadership in their top administrative positions is important as students see those models and equate them with what leaders look and act like. This study examined leadership styles of heads of independent schools, focusing on the spectrum of transformational and transactional leadership. It examined general and specific factors leading to gender inequity in top JK-12 educational administration. It offers a foundation for discussion about education and educational administration by presenting the history of the American educational structure. The literature review includes research about educational administration and leadership, as well as the explanation of three theories emerging from the study of leadership differences between men and women. A discussion of leadership styles follows, highlighting literature focusing on the barriers women encounter in attaining leadership roles. The voices and stories of those women who have attained top educational leadership positions conclude the literature review, providing a full spectrum of issues ranging from the inception of the educational system to the reasons for the current disparity of women at the head of school level. This study presents a national study of independent school leadership. Using a mixed methods approach, the study includes quantitative data about leadership styles of heads of school, as well as other demographic indicators that highlight their paths and leadership roles. The qualitative portion of the study culminates in one-on-one interviews with eight female heads of schools to examine their experiences in achieving top educational administration positions. The study results demonstrate that heads of independent schools are generally transformational leaders in their styles. Further, it illuminates the fact that female heads demonstrate more transformational leadership styles than their male counterparts. It also indicates that male heads of school ascended to headship faster than women. Finally, it outlines how the individual voices of female heads collectively indicate that female heads' natural styles of leadership, which are based in relationships, lend themselves to the characteristics of transformational leadership

An examination of improvement paths taken by two previously underperforming schools to improve student outcomes
Effectiveness in education has become a national focus and reform efforts continue with the hope of increasing student achievement and more effectively meet the needs of all students. This need to focus on the achievement of all students has been driven by the sanctions school face if they do not make gains for all identified subgroups. This study investigated two schools restructured under NCLB sanctions. The primary concern was the pathways developed by each school that contributed to the distribution of leadership and the development of the characteristics of a high reliability organization. In addition, the role of data driven decision making as a part of that move to high reliability was explored. Both schools received additional state funding from the Quality Education Investment Act (QEIA). A comparative case study methodology was used with data drawn from three sources, a survey, assessing distributed leadership practices and high reliability organizational characteristics, interviews, and document analysis. The purpose of the data collection was to determine the perception of leadership distribution and the role of data driven decision-making in increasing student achievement. Teachers and administrators at both schools participated in the survey and members of the leadership team were interviewed individually. The data analysis revealed that both schools achieved considerable gains in student achievement during the process of restructuring, and they varied considerably in their pattern of distributing leadership practices. In one school, leadership practices, especially data analysis and improvement strategizing, were widely distributed to teacher leaders and whole grade level teams. The other school's pattern of distributed leadership practice remained primarily in the hands of key administrators and two coaches. The study showed there are advantages and drawbacks to each approach. While a pattern of widely distributing leadership practice served to increase accountability and led to a more collaborative culture, by the third year practices faltered when key teacher leader positions shifted within grade levels or they left the school entirely. The findings indicate that maintaining the effectiveness of the distribution of leadership practice may require more careful consideration of hiring practices and placement of teachers on grade level teams. The more concentrated approach to distributed leadership practice had the benefit of increasing the consistency of implementation of reform initiatives, which led to gradual but consistent gains over a three-year period. This more limited distribution of leadership practices, however, provided few opportunities or structures for teachers to own the change effort. The data revealed a lower sense of teacher efficacy and feelings of responsibility for the change effort. This lack of collective responsibility, which is critical in the development of high reliability organizations, may have long-term consequences of reform sustainability. Examination of data at both a school and team level seemed to be a critical component of student improvement at both schools. Assisting teachers in both data analysis and use to change classroom practice was undertaken in both patterns of leadership distribution. This formative use of the data can result in dramatic effects in student outcomes as evidenced by one of the fifth grade teams using their data to design a program that enabled 98% of students to become proficient or advanced in math. Educational leaders must be cognizant of the multiple components involved developing high reliability and in the distribution of leadership to turn around schools. This study showed that enhancing collective responsibility and engaging in building the capacity of a staff to use data were critical leadership practices in the improvement process regardless of the pattern of leadership distribution. Multiple factors must be considered when deciding which leadership structures and practices if distributed will enable the school to move forward and sustain the progress

Think for yourself : a writing- based chemistry curriculum
Colleges and universities require applicants to have completed chemistry because students develop scientific literacy and critical thinking skills by learning and applying chemistry content. Due to the factual nature of standards assessments, chemistry curriculum is focused on student memorization of facts. As a result, many high school chemistry students are learning chemistry test facts rather than critical thinking skills. Students at Orange County high school, in southern California, participated in a critical thinking chemistry curriculum called Think for Yourself. Students learn to think critically by constructing scientific theories and analyzing problem solving methods. Through a conceptual writing activity, implemented in this curriculum, students constructed scientific theories from common observations by applying their prior knowledge to explaining those observations. Through group and classroom discussions students tested, reaffirmed, and analyzed individual ideas to develop group theories and then scientific theories; applying the scientific method rather than learning about it. I collected conceptual writing and discussion data during the six week implementation and examined the effect of the curriculum on student's scientific literacy development. I analyzed student essays for the use of academic vocabulary and level of conceptual reasoning. Additionally, I analyzed discussions for participation and conceptual change. Collected data supports a development in critical thinking. Students developed their ability to apply prior knowledge to an observation, analyze rationale to adjust ideas and explanations, and derive accurate scientific concepts. Student development in these three areas supports the overall project goal of developing high school student's' ability to think critically by approaching problems scientifically

School Integration Efforts Three Years After "Parents Involved"
Three years ago this week, the U.S. Supreme Court released its 5-4 decision overturning Louisville and Seattle’s voluntarily implemented integration plans and threatening many voluntary plans across the country, the type of plans courts had encouraged for many years.  The Parents Involved decision, issued on June 28, 2007, reflected a divided Supreme Court with four justices strongly supporting these voluntary plans and four justices strongly opposed. Justice Kennedy’s opinion decided the issues and explicitly accepted some kinds of desegregation efforts. The divided decision confused many educators and it was somewhat unclear what did remain legal.  In 2008, the Bush Administration sent a letter to school districts misguidedly interpreting the Parents Involved decision in a way that suggested only race-neutral means of pursuing integration would be legal. This was an inaccurate description of Kennedy’s controlling opinion and suggested that school authorities should abandon all efforts to intentionally pursue integration. As President Barack Obama took office, civil rights groups and other stakeholders anticipated that his administration would be more supportive of integration efforts, including issuing new guidance to replace that from 2008.  Yet, well into the second year of the Obama Administration (which announced earlier this year that it would reinvigorate the Office of Civil Rights) no such guidance about voluntary integration has been issued. From our contacts with school districts across the country, we believe that this guidance is much needed. In addition to these legal and policy constraints and the opportunities and challenges presented by rapidly shifting demographics in the nation’s public schools, school districts, like other governmental bodies, face significant financial pressure in the wake of declining revenues stemming from the economic crisis.  This economic pressure is forcing school districts to make deep cuts in services, which is another potential constraint for integration efforts.

Morning meeting as a tool for community-building and developing literacy skills in ASL and English
For academic learning to occur, students must have the social skills necessary for communicating, expressing ideas, and working with peers. Too often, more emphasis is placed on academic learning before these necessary social skills are highlighted in the classroom. When students feel they have ownership of their classroom, they are apt to take more personal responsibility for their learning and peers. Roxann Kriete's (2002) design for the Morning Meeting is used as a tool for learning and practicing the social skills necessary for academic learning. In the case of Deaf education classrooms, these social skills are important for developing both ASL and English, a sense of community, and a cultural identity. The Morning Meeting was adapted for a first grade classroom in the setting of a residential school for the Deaf. The classroom had an existing form of Morning Meeting that was modified to focus on a set of goals. The Morning Meeting, with some adaptations to meet Deaf students' needs, provided students with opportunities not only to practice specific social skills, but also to improve their reading and writing through the use of the Morning Message in both ASL and English. The findings suggest the curriculum was effective in enhancing students' social and cultural behaviors, developing the classroom as a community, and improving literacy skills in ASL and English

Cowan is the only professor in UCSC’s history to serve two (widely separated) terms as chair of the Santa Cruz Division of the Academic Senate, from 1979 to 1980 and again from 1994 to 1996. In 1997, he received the first Dean McHenry Award for Distinguished Leadership, given by the UCSC Academic Senate to acknowledge outstanding service.
      Cowan was also the founding chair of the American studies department and a national leader in that field, serving as president of the American Studies Association from 1984 to 1986. In addition, Cowan served as vice chair and then chair of the (UC Systemwide) Academic Council and Assembly from 1999 to 2001. In 2006, Cowan received the Oliver Johnson Award, which biennially recognizes a member of the UC faculty who has performed outstanding service to the Academic Senate, an honor he shared with former UCSC Chancellor Karl Pister.

The hunting of the learning organization - A paradoxical journey
<p>This article addresses the epistemology of learning, as reflected in some discourses of the learning organization. The article is inspired by, and draws substantially from, Lewis Carroll’s ‘Hunting of the Snark’. It employs a broadly systemic theoretical perspective. The article highlights relevant characteristics of Carroll’s fiction and argues for the importance of differentiation between orders of learning, following Bateson’s model of levels of learning. Building on this differentiation of orders of learning, and on the notion of the inevitable paradoxical nature of organizations, the article explores a possible conceptual integration of ‘learning’ and ‘politics’, which Easterby-Smith et al. consider desirable. A question raised is of whether experiences cited as paradigmatic of ‘the learning organization’ are most likely to be transient and emergent. The analysis questions the extent to which such states can be produced through intention and design, and therefore to what extent the wish for these to become permanent states may parallel the hunt for the Snark.</p>

High Speed Rail in Japan: A Review and Evaluation of the Shinkansen Train
This is one of a series of reports now being produced as the first output of our study of the potential for a high-speed passenger train service in California. Each report deals with a specific high-speed train technology; it attempts an evaluation, standardized as far as available data permit, of its technical and economic viability.
      Specifically, each report assesses the particular high-speed technology against a number of criteria:
      1. Technical Performance: configuration of roadbed in terms of gradients, curvature, and construction cost; power sources; capacity and speed; capacity to integrate with existing transportation facilities.
      2. Economic performance: traffic levels; revenues; financial appraisal and overall cost-benefit analysis; level of public subsidy required, if any.
      3. Resource consumption and environmental performance: type and amount of energy required; impact on non-renewable resources; environmental impact, including emissions, noise, visual intrusion and effect on local communities.
      The present series includes five studies. Two companion studies, on British Rail's InterCity 125 and 225 services and on Tilting Trains (the Italian Pendolino and the Swedish X-2000 service), will follow shortly. Thereafter, a systematic comparative analysis will be published.
      The CalSpeed study will continue with preliminary route alignments, also to be produced shortly, followed by market assessments, to be completed in Fall 1992. These will bring to a close the present phase of work, which will be the subject of an overall report also to be completed in Fall 1992.

      and faculty body, and the core curriculum focused on cultural pluralism. Much of the core curriculum focused on teaching writing and science skills, both of which were neglected in the education of historically marginalized students. The idea was that students would take these acquired skills back to their home communities.
      These oral history interviews were conducted in 1982, ten years after Oakes College opened, by Roseanne Shensa, a UCSC student under the mentorship of then- Regional History Project director Randall Jarrell. Publication was delayed due to lack of resources for transcription.

School Culture and Performance at Different Middle Level Structures
American educators and researchers have spent decades attempting to determine the most effective middle level school configuration.  Although various models have been conceptualized in order to resolve one of our most extensive educational reform movements, a recent nationwide increase in K-8 schools suggest interested parties have accepted the K-8 concept for its favorable results as compared to middle schools.  Some of the positives of the K-8 concept include: greater involvement of parents and staff, higher achievement, higher student self-esteem, and fewer incidents of student misconduct reflecting a more positive school climate.  Other research, however, has shown that grade level organization does not directly correlate to higher achievement and that school climate, organizational values, and teacher attitudes are more significant in explaining school performance.  The purpose of this dissertation was to investigate the inconsistencies of past middle level research and determine if K-8 school configurations outperform middle schools in California.    Findings partially support the construct validity of the originally-proposed Heck and Marcoulides model (1996b) across K-8 and MS structures and, demonstrate that K-8s outperform MS at the 8th grade level.  Moreover, the study identified educationally important aspects of teacher-perceived cultural variables and how these perceptions collectively and specifically impact school performance in K-8 schools but not in middle schools.  In order to develop higher achieving middle level schools, school leaders are encouraged to (1) prioritize team building strategies to empower staff, bolster collegiality, and allow the principal to focus on school performance, (2) connect parents to the school via meetings and workshops designed to improve parental support at home, and (3) dedicate time and resources for teachers to participate in decision-making and to discuss best teaching practices with their peers.  These recommendations may apply to most school settings regardless of configuration.  One problem with the MS structure may be that staff members have less time to develop relationships with students and their parents compared to the K-8 structure.  Further, disparity in school performance can be attributed mostly to teacher perception differences of the school climate, teacher attitudes, and organizational values.

Comparing Training Approaches for Technological Skill Development in Introductory Statistics Courses
Technology has transformed the modern introductory statistics course, but little is known about how students develop the skills required to use this technology. This study compares two different training approaches for learning to operate statistical software packages. Guided training (GT) uses direct instruction and explicit guidance during training, whereas active-exploratory training types, such as error-management training (EMT), promote self-directed exploration. Previous studies in general software training suggest that EMT outperforms GT at promoting adaptive skill transfer. This study recruited a sample of 115 psychology students enrolled in introductory statistics courses that ran concurrently across two campuses. These students completed weekly, one-hour training sessions learning to use the statistical package SPSS. In the final week of the semester, students completed an SPSS certification task to measure adaptive skill transfer. The EMT and GT approach was implemented in Campus A and B respectively. Due to non-random allocation, the covariates of gender, personal access, statistical knowledge, and training progress were taken into account when modeling adaptive transfer between training approaches. After controlling for these covariates, no difference in adaptive transfer was found between training approaches. The results suggest that improving access to statistical packages may provide a more powerful way to improve the development of technological skills over using different training approaches.

Process adequacy : successful school districts model
The purpose of this study was to examine how three successful high schools and districts in California allocate human and fiscal resources. This study sought to understand how successful high schools and districts serving a diverse student population link financial decisions to student achievement data. Three successful high schools and districts serving students enrolled in the Free and Reduced Price Lunch Program, the English Language Development (ELD) program, and minorities were the focus of this multiple case study. The three high schools and respective districts were systematically selected using multiple criteria including student achievement data from AYP and API reports, and student demographic information. In order to be deemed "successful" for this study, the districts and high schools needed to meet all criteria for AYP and demonstrate API growth for all subgroups. The primary sources of data collection were twelve interviews with school administrators and school board officials. The Superintendent, Chief Business Officer, a School Board Official, and a High School Principal from each of the three successful school districts were interviewed using a semi structured interview protocol developed by the authors of the project "Getting Down to Facts". The interview protocols were grounded on effective schools and educational adequacy frameworks

Factors Influencing Emergency Department Preference for Access to Health Care
Introduction: African-Americans are more likely than Caucasians to access healthcare through the emergency department (ED); however, the reasons behind this pattern are unclear. The objective is to investigate the effect of race, insurance, socioeconomic status, and perceived health on the preference for ED use.
      Methods: This is a prospective study at a tertiary care ED from June to July 2009. Patients were surveyed to capture demographics, healthcare utilization, and baseline health status. The primary outcome of interest was patient-reported routine place of healthcare. Other outcomes included frequency of ED visits in the previous 6 months, barriers to primary care and patient perception of health using select questions from the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36).
      Results: Two hundred and ninety-two patients completed the survey of whom 58% were African-American and 44% were uninsured. African-Americans were equally likely to report 3 or more visits to the ED, but more likely to state a preference for the ED for their usual place of care (24% vs. 13%, p < 0.01). No significant differences between groups were found for barriers to primary care, including insurance. African-Americans less often reported comorbidities or hospitalization within the previous 6 months (23% vs. 34%, p = 0.04). On logistic regression modeling, African-Americans were more than 2 times as likely to select the ED as their usual place of healthcare (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.22 - 4.08).
       
      Conclusion: African-Americans, independent of health insurance, are more likely than Caucasians to designate the ED as their routine place of healthcare. West J Emerg Med. 2012;13(5):410-415.

Teaching English Learners: Toward an Understanding of What it Means to Teachers
This study addresses the challenges teachers face in teaching English Learners, who are learning English as a second language while they are learning academic content in English. Many educational reforms have focused on how to teach them, including Proposition 227 in California in 1998. This study was conducted five years hence, as teachers interpreted, adapted, and implemented policies regarding the education of English Learners. To explore these topics, this study draws upon social and cultural theory, which considers the meaning that is made by humans and the context within which that meaning is made. As context also includes participants' identities, the study also draws upon theories of teacher identity. Thus, the questions that guided this study were: a) what effect, if any, does teaching English Learners have on a teacher's identity and social status in the school, b) what are the challenges teachers perceive in teaching them, c) how do teachers interpret, adapt, and implement English Learner policy, d) what, ultimately, does it mean to teachers to teach English Learners and how is this meaning connected to both the classroom and school and the wider social and political context.Using an ethnographic case-study approach, the researcher explored how teaching English Learners impacted teachers' identity and social status, the challenges teachers faced in doing so, and how teachers interpreted, adapted, and implemented English Learner policy, all within the social and political context of their local district and schools. Data included field notes from participant-observation and interviews along with institutional documents. Data analysis revealed that having an identity as a teacher of English Learners had the greatest impact on teachers' social status, yet not all teachers with English Learners were ascribed this identity. Each teacher also had to navigate challenges related to teaching English Learners, which also contributed to the meaning they made. This study suggests that their teacher identity and social status, intertwined with being deemed capable of meeting parental educational expectations regarding the education of their children, influenced the meaning they made of teaching English Learners and how teachers interpreted, adapted, and implemented English Learner policy in their classrooms.

Exploring Factors that Lead to Participation in Study Abroad
Despite the many demonstrated benefits of a study abroad experience, trends in campus internationalization, and large-scale governmental initiatives to promote international education, participation of U.S. students in study abroad remains relatively low.  The purpose of this study was to address the disparity between high levels of student interest and low levels of participation by exploring factors that lead to student participation.Previous studies have explored how participation may relate to intent, motivation, or other characteristics and have also identified a number of barriers, both real and perceived, that prevent more students from studying abroad.  Prior research has focused mainly on the student; an overlooked resource throughout the literature is the study abroad professional.  The current study sought to identify participation factors by gathering the perspectives of professionals who work in the field of international education and have experience working with or at institutions with high or increasing rates of student participation in study abroad.  Using a mixed methods triangulation design with a convergence model, results from the 2010 IIE-Forum Snapshot survey of study abroad professionals (n=219) were compared with findings from a focus group and interviews conducted with a total of 17 study abroad professionals from colleges/universities and from third-party program providers / International Education Organizations (IEO).  Findings indicate that faculty support and curriculum/academic integration are the key factors that lead to student participation in study abroad.  While these factors are not new to the field of international education, their prioritization above the perceived role of funding represents a potential new area of focus.  Efforts to address low student participation rates typically involve increased marketing to students and requests to the institution for more funding and staffing.  The current study suggests that given the role of faculty support in encouraging higher rates of student participation at successful institutions, outreach efforts aimed directly at faculty may be more effective than trying to convince students to study abroad or trying to target the many barriers individually.  Furthermore, working towards curriculum/academic integration can more effectively build an institutional culture that supports study abroad, eliminates barriers, and leads to greater rates of student participation.

Missing Messages: The Influences of Class and Culture on Educational Achievement in First Generation Immigrant Families
In response to cultural and institutional beliefs about the necessity of an education and the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) that has increased academic accountability on schools and teachers, research on predictors of academic achievement has expanded over the past decade.  Classically, research on achievement has noted the significance of demographic factors and the positive relationship between socioeconomic status (SES), parental involvement and academic achievement.  As such, research on achievement within low SES populations has taken center stage.  Along these lines, scholars have focused on how cultural and environmental factors also affect achievement in disadvantaged minority populations.  Finally, as schools reorganize to meet NCLB mandates and as the teaching-learning-evaluation process is altered in the response to these shifts, scholars have begun to examine how NCLB has affected teaching, learning and achievement in the classroom.  Unfortunately, less attention has been paid towards understanding how NCLB alters the significance of parent involvement on the achievement process.  This dissertation identifies relevant dimensions of parent involvement in first generation Mexican families and considers how changes to the U.S. educational system affect opportunities for relevant forms of involvement and assessments of student achievement.Using a sample of 54 first generation Mexican families with an eighth-grade child, I examine parent involvement and student success through exploring how these parents conceptualize meanings of education and understand their utility within their child's schooling.  The findings from this project highlight how academically, linguistically, economically disadvantaged parents involve themselves in their child's education and how their children perceive and are affected by these interactions.  Contrary to classic understandings about the linear relationships between SES, parental involvement, and academic aspirations, I discuss the counterintuitive effects of income on children's perceptions of their parents' utility, as tempered by the cultural histories and linguistic boundaries of their parents.  Following this discussion, I consider how NCLB has affected the structure of schooling and culture of learning in U.S. schools and how these shifts diminish the ways in which first generation Mexican families are able to remain involved in their child's educational success.  Finally, suggestions for future research and policy development that have the potential for meeting the needs of a rapidly changing educational environment and growing Latino student population are offered.

A Return to the "Mexican Room": The Segregation of Arizona's English Learners
This paper reviews the research on the impact of segregation on Latino and English learner students, including new empirical research conducted in Arizona. It also reviews court decisions regarding students' rights to be integrated with their mainstream peers, and provides data on the increasing segregation of Arizona's Latino and English learner students. Given that the great majority (over 80%) of Arizona's English language learners are Spanish speakers, there is considerable overlap between ELL and Latino students. The paper also reviews the extant literature on the impact of segregation at both the school and classroom levels and pays special attention to the particularly deleterious effects of linguistic isolation for English learners. The paper concludes that the excessive segregation of Arizona's Latino and EL students is most probably harmful to these students' achievement and social and emotional development and that there are alternative strategies that the state could use to ameliorate these harms and provide a more effective education for these students.

Economic Crisis and the California State Public University: The Institutional, Professional and Personal Effects on Faculty and Students
From the foreward by Gary Orfield:
      As we face the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, college opportunity has been negatively impacted by drastic cuts and the rising cost of education. In California specifically, higher education opportunity seems to be nearly out of reach for low-income students, academically unprepared students, and students of color. Historically, higher education has been considered a mechanism of upward mobility. Considered part of the “American Dream,” parents encourage their children to strive for this goal, even if parents themselves never attended college.Academically underprepared students, or this lacking the basic skills of math ad/or English to be at college-level, represent over half of entering freshmen at the CSU. What these startling numbers really represent is a growing number of underprepared students graduating California high schools, often with excellent grades, yet being denied admission of the state’s public institutions. Despite California’s commitment to universal access to all who can benefit and tuition-free education, what we are seeing is an inability to uphold this social contract at the cost of student’s futures.The negative impact of budget cuts has been felt beyond the students and their families. Recent pay cuts, furloughs, and other declines in financial support have also impacted faculty and staff at the CSU campuses. Increasingly, faculty and staff have feelings of unfairness, as they struggle to provide services and quality education to students, yet experience enormous cut after cut. Morale continues to plummet as faculty and staff are expected to perform the duties of educating the stat’s youth, ye the value of education seems practically non-existent within the state’s budget priorities.

Many of the restructuring models of the last two decades have stressed the need to increase teacher professional expertise as a means of fostering student achievement. One of these models, professional learning communities, proposes a redefinition of the role of teachers through collaborative practices. This research highlights the most salient characteristics of professional learning communities (PLCs) as practiced in a newly restructured public elementary school and considers its impact on the creation of shared technical expertise. It explores how two teams of teachers involved in PLCs acquire and articulate technical knowledge together and the nature of this knowledge. This study used an interpretative approach concerned with the specifics of meaning and action in the interaction of teachers in PLCs. This research defines the specific structure of teacher collaboration and the meaning-perspectives of the participants as they developed this shared learning system of interaction. The investigation highlights the central importance of the allocation and use of non-instructional time for the purpose of collaboration as a precursor to the production of both teacher technical expertise and organic teacher accountability systems. Two main themes developed: first, the highly local nature of the technical knowledge about teaching and learning that is produced through effective teacher collaboration; and, second, the evolving state of accountability within PLC within which formal and informal systems develop that hold members accountable to the group and students. Last, this study discusses the fundamental role that relationships play in fostering dialectic practices about student learning and strengthening collective agreements within collaborative endeavors in the teaching profession. The findings offer insights into the evolving state of teachers as professionals and how PLCs are affecting the way schools view teaching and learning.

Design and baseline characteristics of the Short bouTs of Exercise for Preschoolers (STEP) study
AbstractBackgroundMost preschool centers provide two 30-min sessions of gross-motor/outdoor playtime per preschool day. Within this time frame, children accumulate most of their activity within the first 10&#8201;min. This paper describes the design and baseline participant characteristics of the Short bouTs of Exercise for Preschoolers (STEP) study. The STEP study is a cluster randomized controlled study designed to examine the effects of short bouts of structured physical activity (SBS-PA) implemented within the classroom setting as part of designated gross-motor playtime on during-school physical activity (PA) in preschoolers.Methods/DesignTen preschool centers serving low-income families were randomized into SBS-PA versus unstructured PA (UPA). SBS-PA schools were asked to implement age-appropriate 10&#8201;min structured PA routines within the classroom setting, twice daily, followed by 20&#8201;min of usual unstructured playtime. UPA intervention consisted of 30&#8201;min of supervised unstructured free playtime twice daily. Interventions were implemented during the morning and afternoon designated gross-motor playtime for 30&#8201;min/session, five days/week for six months. Outcome measures were between group difference in during-preschool PA (accelerometers and direct observation) over six-months. Ten preschool centers, representing 34 classrooms and 315 children, enrolled in the study. The average age and BMI percentile for the participants was 4.1&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.8&#8201;years and 69th percentile, respectively. Participants spent 74% and 6% of their preschool day engaged in sedentary and MVPA, respectively.DiscussionResults from the STEP intervention could provide evidence that a PA policy that exposes preschoolers to shorter bouts of structured PA throughout the preschool day could potentially increase preschoolers&#8217; PA levels.Trial registrationClinicaltrials.gov, NCT01588392

Student Trust: Impacting High School Outcomes
There has been growing recognition of the importance of trust in efforts to reform schools, improve learning, and positively impact student achievement. Previous research has focused on trust between adult actors--teachers, parents and principals--typically in elementary school settings. This dissertation shifts the focus to student trust, asking whether and how student trust in high schools matters. Trust is conceptualized as a multi-faceted construct involving the discernment of benevolence, competence and integrity in school organizations and staff. Structural Equation Modeling is used to measure student trust as a second order factor with benevolence, competence and integrity as first order factors; and to determine the effect of trust on high school outcomes such as graduation and post-secondary plans, controlling for prior achievement and student background.Data for this study is drawn from the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS). ELS provides a nationally representative sample of over 14,000 students attending more than 750 public, private and Catholic schools,  representing 3.2 million students in the U.S. who were high school sophomores in 2002, with follow-up studies in 2004 and 2006.Results show that student trust has a significant measureable effect on high school outcomes. Students with high levels of trust have more positive high school outcomes than students low in trust. Trusting students are more likely to graduate, have more ambitious postsecondary plans and higher grade point averages. Additionally, this research demonstrates that while all three facets of trust are important, student estimation of benevolence is the most important, followed by equal amounts of competence and integrity.

The Impact of Short-Term Science Teacher Professional Development on the Evaluation of Student Understanding and Errors Related to Natural Selection
This study evaluated the effects of a short-term professional development session. Forty volunteer high school biology teachers were randomly assigned to one of two professional development conditions: (a) developing deep content knowledge (i.e., control condition) or (b) evaluating student errors and understanding in writing samples (i.e., experimental condition). A pretest of content knowledge was administered, and then the participants in both conditions watched two hours of online videos about natural selection and attended different types of professional development sessions lasting four hours. The dependent variable measured teacher knowledge and skill related to evaluating student errors and understanding of natural selection. Significant differences between conditions in favor of the experimental condition were found on participant identification of critical elements of student understanding of natural selection and content knowledge related to natural selection. Results suggest that short-term professional development sessions focused on evaluating student errors and understanding can be effective at focusing a participant's evaluation of student work on particularly important elements of student understanding. Results have implications for understanding the types of knowledge necessary to effectively evaluate student work and for the design of professional development.

Information and incentives in stochastic games, social learning and crowdsourcing
My dissertation utilizes tools from game theory to derive novel economic insights in a variety of settings, including social learning with biased information processing beliefs, repeated games with persistent actions and contract design in crowdsourcing labor markets. The first chapter explores how individuals learn from their predecessors when they are subject to biased beliefs about the information processing capabilities of others. I consider a social learning environment in which individuals observe private signals, and learning is asymptotically efficient in the absence of information processing biases. Either underestimating or overestimating others' information processing capabilities can have important implications for the asymptotic efficiency of learning. The second chapter studies a new class of stochastic games in which the actions of a long- run player have a persistent effect on payoffs. The setting is a continuous time game of imperfect monitoring between a long-run and a short-run player. The main result of this paper is to establish general conditions for the existence of Markovian equilibria and conditions for the uniqueness of a Markovian equilibrium in the class of all Perfect Public Equilibria. The existence proof is constructive and characterizes, for any discount rate, the explicit form of equilibrium payoffs, continuation values, and actions in Markovian equilibria. Action persistence creates a channel to provide intertemporal incentives, and offers a new and different framework for thinking about the reputations of firms, governments, and other long-run agents. The final chapter examines information and incentive issues in a novel labor market setting : crowdsourcing. Our research focuses on how to optimally design labor contracts and the marketplace in a crowdsourcing setting to facilitate efficient information transmission between workers and firms. The structure of such contracts will depend on the institutional features of the specific job, including how costly it is for a worker to acquire information or how likely it is for the firm to observe when a worker incorrectly completes a task

Developing our human capital : a mixed-method study of teacher use of online communities
This study examines teacher use of online communities and the effects they have on teaching and learning in the classroom. Research suggests that different types of communities positively influence organizational and individual learning for professional practice. The Internet has made available many types of online communities connecting an ever increasing number of individuals through more specialized interests. At the same time little is known about the depth of the individual experience in gaining knowledge and learning new skills in this online venue, and particularly what transfers to practice. The purpose of this study was to examine the use of online communities, through the perceptions of the user, as an important tool to improve and support professional practice. This study used two research themes to identify and describe this experience through the lens of the individual teacher experience. First, two existing models of organizational learning (Professional Learning Communities and Communities of Practice) were used to frame the value of communities to professional learning. Second, three theories of human development (self-efficacy, social, and human capital) were used to uniquely situate the individual teacher experience. Convenience samples of teachers in one large urban school district who use online communities were surveyed about their online community use (n=44). From this sample, a select group of teachers completed an open- ended semi structured electronic text based interview (n=10), and of these teachers some participated in a semi structured open-ended one on one interview (n=7). Additionally (11) online community sites identified by study participants were observed. The mixed method approach allowed for the collection and analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data. Analysis of the data shows teachers do perceive that using online community contributes to practice. This was particularly evident for building human capital in the form of increased knowledge and skills, and building a more student centered practice. Self-efficacy and social capital were also increased as a result of using online communities. A model is provided to show the cycle of online community use and points of benefit to the individual user of online communities

Peter Scott, Professor of Physics: Recollections of UCSC, 1966-1994
Peter Scott, Professor of Physics: Recollections of UCSC, 1966-1994, is the edited transcript of a single interview conducted by Randall Jarrell on June 27, 1994. Scott received his B.A. from the University of California, Berkeley, his M.A. from the University of Michigan, and his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley. He then taught as an assistant professor for three years at Stanford University. Attracted to UCSC because it represented an alternative to what he characterized as the machine-like educational atmosphere of UC Berkeley, Scott arrived at UCSC in 1966.
      In this oral history, Scott describes his early history at UCSC, both in the physics board of studies and at Stevenson College. He relates a delightful opportunity to teach innovative seminars for sophomores at Stevenson College, among other anecdotes. He discusses the groundbreaking research undertaken by UCSC undergraduate and graduate students in physics, particularly the "Dynamical Systems Collective". Finally, he offers brief assessments of controversial issues within the University of California, such as the UC management of Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos Laboratories, the narrative evaluation system, and tenure review. Above all, Professor Scott is a proponent of UCSC's interdisciplinary approach to education, remarking that, "You can't really write a thesis or write a story or create something that is not about something else."
      Scott's research interests have included experimental work on the optical and microwave spectra of impurity ions in crystals. In the late 1970s he became interested in dynamical systems, especially those exhibiting chaotic behavior, such as dripping faucets and various types of mechanical systems. Although he retired in 1994, Scott continues to teach courses for the physics board of studies on occasion. He also remains interested in nonlinear dynamical systems.
      Peter Scott is also well-known in the UCSC and Santa Cruz community as an environmental activist, becoming involved over the years in efforts, along with his wife Celia, to preserve open space lands (the Santa Cruz North Coast, the Pogonip, the Gray Whale Ranch) and to work to facilitate the awareness of our remarkable natural surroundings by members of our community. In recent years he has focused on transportation issues, with particular efforts toward reducing our dependence on the automobile. His other creative interests include songwriting, singing in choral groups and woodworking.

The French Train a Grande Vitesse: Focusing on the TGV-Atlantique
This is one of a series of reports now being produced s the first output of our study of the potential for a high-speed passenger train service in California. Each report deals with a specific high-speed train technology; it attempts an evaluation, standardized as far as available data permit, or its technical and economic viability.
      Specifically, each report assesses the particular high-speed technology against a number of criteria:
      1. Technical Performance: configuration of roadbed in terms of gradients, curvature, and construction cost; power sources; capacity and speed; capacity to integrate with existing transportation facilities.
      2. Economic performance: traffic levels; revenues; financial appraisal and overall cost-benefit analysis; level of public subsidy required, if any.
      3. Resource consumption and environmental performance: type and amount of energy required; impact on non-renewable resources; environmental impact, including emissions, noise, visual intrusion and effect on local communities.
      The present series includes five studies. Two companion studies, on British Rail's InterCity 125 and 225 services and on Tilting Trains (the Italian Pendolino and the Swedish X-2000 service), will follow shortly. Thereafter, a systematic comparative analysis will be published.
      The CalSpeed study will continue with preliminary route alignments, also to be produced shortly, followed by market assessments, to be completed in Fall 1992. These will bring to a close the present phase of work, which will be the subject of an overall report also to be completed in Fall 1992.

Google your math : sustaining a sociocultural environment through collaborative online participation in algebra
This curricular project explores how students used Google online environments to sustain the aspects of sociocultural learning through student collaboration and dialogue instrumental in the math classroom. The students in this project were from two tenth-grade Algebra 1 classes in a culturally diverse San Diego public high school. Using knowledge-building principles, online dialogue and collaborative activities were created to increase student practice of algebra at home and to increase both conceptual understanding and procedural fluency. Theories of motivation regarding student choice, flexible environments, and receiving feedback were integral factors in this project design. The research found the online Google environments equitably accessed by all students - particularly students with learning disabilities and students from minority populations. Additionally, more students practiced algebra at home during implementation. The data showed that students used Google activities for knowledge sharing and problem solving in math. The results from pre and post- implementation assessments found the greatest overall improvement from students who participated online as well as evidence of narrowing achievement gaps in mathematical performances between student populations. While Google was not a substitute for classroom instruction, it did promote student peripheral participation (Lave and Wenger, 1991) in a learning community for algebra. The activities described in this project are not specific to algebra but can be applied to other math class as well as to different subject areas

Assessment of self-directed learning in an online context in the community college setting
Online learning in higher education has increased substantially over the past five years with community colleges in the forefront of most of this growth. The California Community Colleges System, the nation's largest higher education system, has increased its online offerings among its 110 colleges. But student success rates for online learning have not matched up to that of the traditional face-to-face class. This study was conducted at a southern California community college with a student population of about 18,000. This study is based on the theoretical framework of adult learning principles. The application of two assumptions of adult learning principles--self-directedness and intrinsic motivation--to online courses is studied in two social science courses. Using the Adult Learning Inventory developed by Colton (2002), instructional methods based on adult learning principles have been investigated to understand the intrinsic motivation and self-directedness of online learners in the community college setting. This is a multiple-case study design with embedded units of analysis. The study intends to inform online course developers of components toward an online pedagogical construct that addresses adult learners in the community college context

Schooling La Raza : a Chicana/o cultural history of education, 1968-2008
My dissertation, "Schooling La Raza : A Chicana/o Cultural History of Education, 1968-2008," interrogates the function of memory, the politics of representation, and the educational formation of subjectivity in the creation of what I am calling a Chicana/o cultural history of schooling. I focus on the integral role that schooling and educational processes play in the formation of Chicana/o subjectivity as expressed in various forms of cultural production that emerged in the decades after the Movimiento era. I synthesize theories of gender, sexuality, racial formation, multiculturalism, and critical pedagogy in my analyses of Chicana/o cultural production of schooling and education. I argue that formal and informal educational spaces and pedagogical relationships play a central role in activating the emergence and articulation of racialized, gendered, and non-normative or queer identity formations in an array of recent cultural production by Chicanas/os. The artistic and cultural expressions I examine in this project provide an avenue for understanding how Chicanas/os remember and recreate moments of individual and collective educational struggle in the post-Movimiento, 'multicultural' decades of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. These works of Chicana and Chicano cultural production, I argue, attest to the simultaneous oppression and potential liberation of schooling and education in this country for Chicanas/os and other racialized and subjugated groups. In short, "Schooling La Raza" analyzes historical shifts in ideologies of and relationships to education and schooling, while opening up space to imagine alternative possibilities for the liberation of the educated Chicana/o subject

A cultural communities approach to teacher early literacy practices
Increased awareness of the school readiness gap, particularly for students from ethnic and linguistically diverse backgrounds, has led policy makers, researchers, and practitioners to examine the quality of language and literacy experiences of low income preschoolers. This nested case study used a mixed methods design to describe teacher language and literacy practices in a Head Start program serving predominantly dual language Mexican heritage children. Adopting a sociocultural perspective on literacy development, the research used the construct of cultural communities to examine the role of teacher beliefs, values and goals for children on espoused and enacted early literacy practices. Findings indicated a complex relationship between espoused and enacted practices that could be traced to teachers' participation in various and overlapping cultural communities. Teachers in the study struggled to name research based practices and while effective strategies were observed, they did not occur with sufficient frequency or duration to lead to improved educational outcomes for children at risk. Physical, cultural, and linguistic context mediated teacher practices in complex and multifaceted ways, which emerged as a major finding of the study. In addition, data pointed to a lack of intentional teaching and deep understanding of early childhood development in general and early language and literacy in particular. Important implication for practice emerged, including the need to continue to explore pre-service education, the role of leadership in early childhood education, and the affect of teacher beliefs on practices, including those for dual language learners

Edward J. Wickson's Quiet Voice for Change: The Origins of California's Secondary Agricultural Education Curriculum in the Early Twentieth Century
This study examines Edward J. Wickson's involvement in the origins of California's secondary agricultural education curriculum.  Wickson held a variety of positions in the College of Agriculture at the University of California from 1876 through 1915.  Additionally, he was the editor of the Pacific Rural Press, an influential publication popular in the agricultural community.  During this same time period, agricultural education in California's secondary schools took root and spread rapidly.  Within eleven years, agricultural education grew from non-existence in California's high schools to being included in nearly one-third of them.  The purpose of this study is to understand the socio-historical context of the tension between California's academic and agricultural communities and Wickson's involvement in mediating this conflict, while quietly advancing his educational agenda.  Additionally, this study explores the various changes in the agricultural education curriculum within California's educational institutions prior to the passage of the Smith-Hughes Act of 1917.  By investigating the origins of agricultural education within California's secondary schools, this study offers a portrayal of the rural community during a period of tension and transition and an agricultural education community that struggled with self-identity during the early twentieth century. The data for this study includes a variety of primary sources, including personal correspondence, local and national newspaper articles, secondary agricultural education textbooks, and California's Agricultural Experiment Station bulletins.

Johnny Walks to School - Does Jane? Sex Differences in Children's Active Travel to School
Communities are traditionally built with one transportation mode and user in mind—the adult automobile driver. Recently, however, there has been an international focus on the trip to school as an opportunity to enhance children’s independent active travel. Several factors must be considered when designing programs to promote walking and bicycling. This paper examined the influence of child sex on caregivers’ decisions about travel mode choice to school.
      Caregivers of children in grades three to five from ten California Safe Routes to School communities were surveyed on their child’s normal travel mode to school and factors that determined travel decisions. Results indicate that the odds of walking and bicycling to school are 40 percent lower in girls than boys; however, this relationship is significantly moderated by the caregiver’s own walking behavior. The findings suggest that programs that focus on increasing children’s active travel to school should consider multiple influences on health behavior, including the neighborhood physical activity of parents.

Squeezed from All Sides: The CSU Crisis and California's Future
This report is the first in a series called "The CSU Crisis and California’s Future." These reports are designed to analyze the impact of the fiscal cutbacks on opportunity for higher education in the California State University system, the huge network of 23 universities that provide the greatest amount of BA level of education in the state. The CSU has a much larger undergraduate student body than the University of California system and educates a much larger group of Latino and African American students. Many CSU students are first generation college students struggling to get an education in difficult times. This first report looks at how students are impacted by the fiscal crisis and budget cuts to CSUs. When the state of California adopted the Master Plan for Higher Education in 1960 it made a social contract with the young people of the state to provide them with a higher education. But the state has broken that social contract for many of its students. California has great wealth, but it also has many millions living in poverty with very low levels of education.

You Will Have To Work Ten Times as Hard at the CSU: Reducing Outreach and Recruitment in Times of Economic Crisis
From the foreward by Gary Orfield:
      As we face the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, college opportunity has been negatively impacted by drastic cuts and the rising cost of education. In California specifically, higher education opportunity seems to be nearly out of reach for low-income students, academically unprepared students, and students of color. Historically, higher education has been considered a mechanism of upward mobility. Considered part of the “American Dream,” parents encourage their children to strive for this goal, even if parents themselves never attended college.Academically underprepared students, or this lacking the basic skills of math ad/or English to be at college-level, represent over half of entering freshmen at the CSU. What these startling numbers really represent is a growing number of underprepared students graduating California high schools, often with excellent grades, yet being denied admission of the state’s public institutions. Despite California’s commitment to universal access to all who can benefit and tuition-free education, what we are seeing is an inability to uphold this social contract at the cost of student’s futures.The negative impact of budget cuts has been felt beyond the students and their families. Recent pay cuts, furloughs, and other declines in financial support have also impacted faculty and staff at the CSU campuses. Increasingly, faculty and staff have feelings of unfairness, as they struggle to provide services and quality education to students, yet experience enormous cut after cut. Morale continues to plummet as faculty and staff are expected to perform the duties of educating the stat’s youth, ye the value of education seems practically non-existent within the state’s budget priorities.

Kenneth V. Thimann: Early UCSC History and the Founding of Crown College
The late scientist's oral history memoir is published posthumously. Thimann died at his home in Haverford, Pennsylvania, on January 15, 1997. Founding Chancellor Dean E. McHenry made an inspired and imaginative appointment when he invited Thimann in 1965 to head what would become Crown College and to build the science faculty at UCSC. Prior to coming to Santa Cruz, Thimann was an internationally renowned plant physiologist and held the Higgins Chair in Biology at Harvard University. He was the first UCSC faculty member who was a member of the National Academy of Sciences. During his tenure at UCSC his illustrious reputation and intellectual distinction enabled him to attract to the fledgling campus top-notch scientists who would perhaps not have come here were it not for his presence. The scientists he recruited created what has become in only three decades one of the country's most distinguished group of science departments at a public university.
      Thimann's narration focuses on three major areas--building and developing Crown College, the campus's first science-oriented college; recruiting science faculty and creating graduate programs in the sciences; and his views on UCSC's evolution, including the narrative evaluation system, McHenry's chancellorship, and the founding of the Crown Chamber Players. Other subjects in his commentary include the decline of the college system in the 1970s, the founding of the Arboretum, and the Chicano Pre-Med Summer Program.

The role of organizational learning and social networks in school improvement : a case study of corrective action schools
Much research has been conducted on effective schools and school reform efforts. However, many schools are failing to meet the NCLB demands and an increasing number of schools are falling under the "in needs of improvement" sanctions, especially in the corrective action phase. The schools in the corrective action phase are those that have not met Yearly Adequate Progress (AYP) for three consecutive years. Current research suggests there may be more to school reform than intellectual and human capital investment. Reform efforts may require a shift in the way that change strategies are conceptualized and enacted within schools and the districts in which they reside. This shift would involve a move from a spotlight on individualized segments of the organization to engaging the entire system in a connected network. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the processes school staff used to diagnose problems, define solutions, and access effective strategies in corrective action schools. It also investigated how these schools implemented these reforms; determined in what ways and to what extent these reform efforts were diffused through the schools using the social networks of information, innovation, trust, knowledge, and communication; and the district's role in supporting reform. The study utilized a mixed methods case study design and analyzed results through the lens of organizational learning and social network analysis theories.

Established and Novel Initiatives to Reduce Crowding in Emergency Departments
Introduction: The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) Task Force on Boarding described high-impact initiatives to decrease crowding. Furthermore, some emergency departments (EDs) have implemented a novel initiative we term “vertical patient flow,” i.e. segmenting patients who can be safely evaluated, managed, admitted or discharged without occupying a traditional ED room. We sought to determine the degree that ACEP-identified high-impact initiatives for ED crowding and vertical patient flow have been implemented in academic EDs in the United States (U.S.). 
      
         Methods: We surveyed the physician leadership of all U.S. academic EDs from March to May 2010 using a 2-minute online survey. Academic ED was defined by the primary site of an emergency residency program. 
      
         Results: We had a response rate of 73% (106/145) and a completion rate of 71% (103/145). The most prevalent hospital-based initiative was inpatient discharge coordination (46% 47/103 of respondents) while the least fully initiated was surgical schedule smoothing (11% 11/103). The most prevalent ED-based initiative was fast track (79% 81/103) while the least initiated was physician triage (12% 12/103). Vertical patient flow had been implemented in 29% (30/103) of responding EDs while an additional 41% (42/103) reported partial/in progress implementation. 
      
         Conclusion: We found great variability in the extent academic EDs have implemented ACEP’s established high-impact ED crowding initiatives, yet most (70%) have adopted to some extent the novel initiative vertical patient flow. Future studies should examine barriers to implementing these crowding initiatives and how they affect outcomes such as patient safety, ED throughput and patient/provider satisfaction.

[teacher, performance, policy]

Teacher Quality Policy When Supply Matters
Recent proposals would strengthen the dependence of teacher pay and retention on performance, in order to attract those who will be effective teachers and repel those who will not. I model the teacher labor market, incorporating dynamic self-selection, noisy performance measurement, and Bayesian learning. Simulations indicate that labor market interactions are important to the evaluation of alternative teacher contracts. Typical bonus policies have very small effects on selection. Firing policies can have larger effects, if accompanied by substantial salary increases. However, misalignment between productivity and measured performance nearly eliminates the benefits while preserving most of the costs.

Rainwater Harvesting in San Francisco Schools
Since 2009, one in eight San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) elementary schools has received a rainwater cistern or barrels and increased garden space under the Tap the Sky initiative.  A quarter of San Francisco elementary schools and two of the city's nine alternative configured schools are planned to have received a cistern system by the end of next year.
      This report seeks to identify the impacts and key components of this rainwater capture initiative, both in terms of sustainable water management and environmental education goals, while also suggesting recommendations for the ongoing implementation and expansion of this practice in San Francisco elementary schools.

Flesh and Blood and Action: Organisations, Learning and Aesthetics
<p>This paper uses a modified version of Gregory Bateson’s levels of learning (Bateson, 2000) to review data from a case study of an arts organisation, in order to contemplate a multimodal understanding of organisational learning; one that sees emotions, aesthetics and learning as complex, interactive and interdependent. Tosey and Mathison (2008) argue that this requires a framework such as Bateson’s, which differentiates between logical types, and (in its modified form) between embodied, analytic and aesthetic modes of knowing. Such a proposition starts to explode the myth of rationality in organisations and approaches which ‘propound an objective and universal interpretative key to organisational life’ (Strati, 2000: 14). `Bateson… distinguishes between process and description of process, because “our description will be in words or figures or pictures but that what we describe is going to be in flesh and blood and action”.’ (Roach &amp; Bednar, 1997).</p>

Independent Interactive Inquiry-Based Learning Modules Using Audio-Visual Instruction In Statistics
Simulations can make complex ideas easier for students to visualize and understand. It has been shown that guidance in the use of these simulations enhances students’ learning. This paper describes the implementation and evaluation of the Independent Interactive Inquiry-based (I3) Learning Modules, which use existing open-source Java applets, combined with audio-visual instruction. Students are guided to discover and visualize important concepts in post-calculus and algebra-based courses in probability and statistics. Topics include the binomial distribution, confidence intervals, significance testing, and randomization. We show that this format can be used independently by students at the introductory and advanced levels. The percentage of students answering correctly on posttests was larger than that for pretests for three of the four modules described.

Optimizing the orchestration of resemiotization with teacher "talk moves" : a model of guided-inquiry instruction in middle school science
The current conceptualization of science set forth by the National Research Council (2008) is one of science as a social activity, rather than a view of science as a fixed body of knowledge. This requires teachers to consider how communication, processing, and meaning-making contribute to science learning. It also requires teachers to think deeply about what constitutes knowledge and understanding in science, and what types of instruction are most conducive to preparing students to participate meaningfully in the society of tomorrow. Because argumentation is the prominent form of productive talk leading to the building of new scientific knowledge, one indicator of successful inquiry lies in students' abilities to communicate their scientific understandings in scientific argumentation structures. The overarching goal of this study is to identify factors that promote effective inquiry-based instruction in middle school science classrooms, as evidenced in students' abilities to engage in quality argumentation with their peers. Three specific research questions were investigated: 1) What factors do teachers identify in their practice as significant to the teaching and learning of science? 2) What factors do students identify as significant to their learning of science? and 3) What factors affect students' opportunities and abilities to achieve sophisticated levels of argumentation in the classroom? Two teachers and forty students participated in this study. Four principle sources of data were collected over a three-month period of time. These included individual teacher interviews, student focus group interviews, fieldnotes, and approximately 85 hours of classroom videotape. From this sample, four pathways for guided-inquiry instruction are identified. Opportunities for student talk were influenced by a combination of factors located in the domains of "teacher practice," "classroom systems," and "physical structures." Combinations of elements from these three dimensions also affected the quality of student argumentation, as measured on a five-point rubric developed for analysis. Of the four pathways, one in particular is identified as a model of "best practice," leading to the highest levels of argumentation resulting from opportunities for student resemiotization mediated by teacher "talk moves."

Landscapes of Dance: the 1960 Summer Workshop of Anna Halprin
This thesis explores Bay Area choreographer Anna Halprin's 1960 summer workshop and affiliations with workshop participants such as Trisha Brown, Yvonne Rainer, Simone Forti, La Monte Young, and Robert Morris. I selected these particular participants because of  their roles in shaping overarching fields of dance, visual arts and music. Through articulating the significance of the workshop as influential on artistic process, I frame the 1960 workshop as in concert with the larger world of the avant-garde, including Allan Kaprow's Happenings, Fluxus performances, Judson Dance Theater, Minimalist sculpture and post-war experimental music.  In addition, I extend the concerns of event-based performance into the lexicon of landscape architecture by acknowledging Lawrence Halprin's role in the workshop as the architect of the deck and marital collaboration with Halprin. Eventually, he adopted scores into his architectural practice, designed scores for Halprin's dances and focused on pedestrian activities in his designs of public spaces.

Excerpt from Stubborn Roots: Race, Culture, and Inequality in U.S. and South African Schools
Prudence L. Carter takes on the formidable task of assessing the impact of race on the culture of public schools, among both students and faculty, in two nations marked by histories of extreme racial inequality: the United States and South Africa. Through school visits, interviews, and patient compilation of statistics, she examines the salience, and in some cases the slippery role, of race in interpersonal and professional relations. In the process, she bravely attempts to bring out the voices and subjectivities of the people on all sides of the color line(s) with whom she interacts.

Making Sense of Tourism Teaching
<p>This paper gives details about a study into the evaluation of tourism teaching in higher education.  Although there has been a rapid growth in research into tourism education, little has focused on teaching or its evaluation.  The work draws on literature from the field of education more generally to arrive at a set of dimensions.  Based on these it explains a study conducted in the United Kingdom.  Findings suggest that the important dimensions relate to the extent to which teaching is linked both to the vocational aspects as well as to deeper sets of experiences.</p>
