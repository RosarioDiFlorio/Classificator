RESPONDING TO STUDENT DIVERSITY: TWO CASES IN CYPRUS
This study set out to examine how the Cypriot educational context is structuredto promote inclusive education to cater for the needs of the increasingly diversestudent population in Greek-Cypriot public schools. Emphasis was given toidentifying barriers to the inclusive education of non-Greek-Cypriot students.Ways of addressing these barriers, and therefore ways to promote an inclusiveand essentially a multicultural education in schools in Cyprus, were explored.The research design involved the evaluation of two cases: a primary school inLimassol and a secondary school in Nicosia. Both schools catered for anethnically diverse student population. The use of a multi-method techniqueallowed primarily for the exploration of the “voices” of pupils in these schools, onthe topic of inclusive educational provision present in their schools. Teachers’interviews extended the image of the inclusive & multicultural education as itexisted in the schools studied.During the study the most significant barrier to non-Greek-Cypriot students’inclusion appeared to be the lack of Greek language skills, which affects theirsocialization, participation and achievement at school. Other barriers lie with thenegative attitudes of classmates and teaching staff in schools. It is recommendedthat a unified governmental attempt to provide assistance with learning the Greeklanguage in both Primary and Secondary education, and in eliminating negativeattitudes towards non-Greek-Cypriot students could greatly improve theirlearning experiences and inclusion in schools.

Learning in Multiobjective Optimization (Dagstuhl Seminar 12041)
This report documents the programme and outcomes of the Dagstuhl Seminar 12041 "Learning in Multiobjective Optimization". The purpose of the seminar was to bring together researchers from the two main communities studying multiobjective optimization, Multiple Criteria Decision Making and Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization, to take part in a wide-ranging discussion of what constitutes learning in multiobjective optimization, how it can be facilitated, and how it can be measured. The outcome was a deeper, more integrated understanding of the whole problem-solving process in multiobjective optimization from the viewpoint of learning, and several concrete research projects directly addressing different aspects of learning.

Internationalisation of the curriculum and the support of international students: a review of the literature
The aim of this review was to identify existing published literature and current practices of direct relevance to two priority areas for the Higher Education Academy in relation to internationalisation, namely internationalisation of the curriculum and the experiences of international students in UK universities (to include home/international student relations)This Project was commissioned by the Higher Education Academy (HEA) in March 2006. It developed from the HEA Internationalisation Forum on 5th December 2005 that focused on ‘Internationalising the Curriculum’ and ‘The Support of International Students’. One outcome from the Forum was the recognition that further research into these areas was required. To usefully build on existing work and support emerging policy and practice a bibliographic search and literature review was a necessary first step.Viv Caruana and Nicola Spurling in the Education Development Unit at the University of Salford were commissioned to conduct this work.

Research into literacy and technology in primary classrooms: an exploration of understandings generated by recent studies
Whilst much has been written about the implications for ‘literacy’ for practices surrounding digital technologies (Gee, 2000a; Luke and Carrington, 2002; Snyder, 1998), there has been surprisingly little research investigating new literacies in primary classrooms (Andrews, 2003; Labbo and Reinking, 2003: Lankshear and Knobel, 2003). This review examines the kinds of understandings that have been generated through studies of primary literacy and technology reported during the period 2000-2006. It uses Green’s distinction between ‘operational’, ‘cultural’ and ‘critical’ dimensions of primary literacy (Lankshear and Bigum, 1999; Snyder, 2001) to investigate the focus and methodology of 38 empirical studies. It explores ways in which research may be informed by assumptions and practices associated with print literacy, but also highlights the kinds of studies which are beginning to investigate the implications of digital texts for primary education. The paper concludes by arguing for further ethnographic and phenomenological studies of classroom literacy practices in order to explore the complex contexts which surround and are mediated by digital texts.

How can the concepts of habitus and field help us to understand the engagement of educational workers in higher Education?
In ‘Making a European area of lifelong learning a reality’, the EU stressed the role of universities in relation to lifelong learning, a role that entails a need for widening access to universities, particularly for those not coming through the traditional direct route of upper secondary education. As teachers play a significant role in the quality of the lifelong learning as well as in motivating future generations to take part in lifelong learning, education and training for teachers becomes important; not only in relation to initial teacher education, but also in relation to a continuous development of knowledge and skills. 
This paper represents the first stage of a larger comparative project intended to examine and compare educational workers’ (i.e. professionals involved in teaching in the class room) participation in higher education in England and Denmark, their access and interest. In particular, the paper relates participation and engagement to national and international educational policies and frames this work within an examination of the social background of the professional groups. The key research questions at this stage of the work are methodological and can be summed up by the overarching question, “How can the concepts of habitus and field help us to understand levels of engagement of educational workers in Higher Education”?
The paper reports the results of our review of current policies and our efforts to identify the structural relations within the educational professional fields in each country. To do so we are developing a theoretical model using the relational analytical approach advocated by Bourdieu. As such, our work is an early stage attempt at operationalising Bourdieu’s observations regarding the dynamics of field. This seems to us to provide an important conceptual approach to understanding the habitus of educational workers in the context of the dynamics of a fast changing policy arena and the complexities of the backgrounds of individuals working in the educational field. The model attempts to build in the reflexivity that Bourdieu demands for a ‘science’ that is not weakened by over-emphasis on either the objective structural relations or the subjective phenomenology of experience. 
Thus, the paper presents a preliminary contextual analysis of the factors that enable an understanding of engagement or lack of engagement in higher level learning among school-based education workers in the two EU countries and is related to a larger research project that explores habitus (both individual and collective) among these groups of education workers.

Theoretical and Empirical Analysis of Diversity in Non-Stationary Learning
In non-stationary learning, we require a predictive model to learn over time, adapting to changes in the concept if necessary. A major concern in any algorithm for non-stationary learning is its rate of adaptation to new concepts. When tackling such problems with ensembles, the concept of \emph{diversity} appears to be of significance. In this paper, we discuss how we expect diversity to impact the rate of adaptation in non-stationary ensemble learning. We then analyse the relation between voting margins and a popular measure of diversity, KW variance, and use the similarities between them to draw some useful conclusions regarding ensemble adaptivity.

A climate for change
<p>This paper reports on the findings of a research project investigating the nature of participation of secondary school students in a collaborative research programme. Four groups of students, aged 14 to 15 years old, from a secondary school in the United Kingdom (UK) participated in the study. The students involved in the programme took the role of researchers investigating their peers’ perceptions of climate change using video to visually record their findings. University researchers worked collaboratively with the school students and a teacher from the school through an approach that empowered the students within the research process. Drawing from the ideas and issues raised from an initial briefing session, each group of students developed a short interview schedule to be used whilst investigating the views of their peers. Although the project was on a small scale, the data gathered from the brainstorming activity, video reports and reflective discussions provided a useful snap shot of how the participating students perceived their experience and the nature of their involvement in the research process. The research approach enabled students to take on the role of investigator when interviewing their peers and to offer a voice for both themselves and their peers. Introduction</p>

Qualities of life, educational level and human development: an international investigation of health.
INTRODUCTION AND METHODS: This study investigated the relationship between health-related quality of life (QoL), educational level and culture, using a high quality cross-cultural generic measure (WHOQOL-BREF) containing 25 international dimensions organised in physical, psychological, social and environmental domains. RESULTS: Cross-cultural data from 9,404 sick and well adults in 13 countries showed that environmental QoL increased positively and sequentially from no education to tertiary education. The other three domains increased only up to secondary school level. These MANCOVA results were significantly influenced by health status, age, culture and economic development level. More positive feelings, less dependence on medication and treatment, better perceptions of financial resources, physical environment, and opportunities for information and skills, represent adult QoL advantages to those who received tertiary education compared with secondary schooling. Developing countries reported poorer environmental, psychological and physical QoL than developed countries, although social QoL was good, and no different for the two development bands. Only psychological QoL distinguished between every educational level, in developing countries. Increased positive feelings serve to link better mental health with more education. Across each domain, secondary and tertiary education was associated with better QoL in developing countries. CONCLUSION: The results support a QoL case for universal secondary education on which better health and health care may be built.

Academic Literacy Practices: plausibility in the essays of a diverse social science cohort
This thesis addresses academic writing using two practice-led disciplines, academic literacies and ethnomethodology. It is first concerned to evaluate the possibilities of cooperation between these cognate endeavours, and concludes that where academic literacies provides a locus and set of topics for academic writing studies, ethnomethodology can contribute a sharpening of focus and of analytic tools. Ethnomethodology provides a reassuring message in that it confirms the value of detailed local studies, in this case of literacy. However, it is also the source of critique for those literacy scholars who have tried to site their studies in dualisms. This is seen as a rejection of situated studies. There is therefore a prominent methodological focus in this thesis. These methodological issues are then discussed in regard to how they translate into agendas and technologies for the study of social literacies. It is shown that ethnographic-type methods are necessary for such studies, even where they do not qualify as ‘full’ ethnographies by traditional standards. This study itself took on a quasi-ethnographic or ethnographic-type approach, using a longitudinal method to track the academic writing practices of eight undergraduate students with the aim of ascertaining the social and collaborative ways in which their work is accorded plausibility. Material from the study is presented in the form of interview analysis, and in a series of ethnographic case studies that use a variety of material, including interviews with students and staff, student essays, and various other materials that were accrued throughout the administrative life of the essays. Various methods for achieving or according plausibility, on the part of both students and staff, are discussed and analysed. Although all protagonists involved in essay writing and marking looked for and dealt in conventions wherever possible, the material presented here demonstrates that participants were generally aware of the limits to the possibilities of phenomena, and that there may be cause to locate, challenge, change, and adapt to the things that can acceptably be said and done in essay writing.

Rethinking partnership in initial teacher education – developing professional identities for a new subject specialist team which includes a joint school-university appointment – a case study in mathematics
A new team of mathematics educators is establishing at the University of Manchester. One member of the team is a joint school-university appointment. A former local authority consultant she now works 50% in a partnership training school where she mentors four students and 50% as a PGCE tutor contributing to all elements of the PGCE course including subject specific and professional studies sessions, tutoring a number of students including school visits.What are the affordances of a joint school-university appointment? What are the personal challenges for the appointee and colleagues working with the appointee – in school and in university?Evidence for the paper is through personal reflective accounts, and focus group discussions with school and university colleagues. There will also be an anonymous questionnaire of student teachers to find out whether the joint school-university appointee’s support is qualitatively different to that of other tutors.Becoming a teacher educator is challenging at the best of times (Berry, 2007; Swennen & van der Klink, 2009), as is establishing yourself as a teacher in a new school (Day et al. 2007). To do both at once is novel, but given current government priorities something that is likely to become more commonplace, with initiatives such as School Direct (TDA, 2011).Professional identity provides a means of interpreting the way practitioners conduct their work (Day et al, 2005) and the development needs they prioritise. In school there are priorities of learning systems and policies and establishing oneself as a member of the adult community. In higher education this often includes embarking on Masters level study as a requirement for becoming a higher education lecturer (HE academy n.d.). The outcomes of this early experience have implications for the developing practice of the University of Manchester PGCE mathematics team and the way in which university and school based colleagues work together to optimise learning for beginning teachers, as new models of ITE are adopted within a well-established partnership. These implications may provide areas for consideration by institutions rethinking partnership in initial teacher education.

A description and evaluation of a challenging behaviour workshop.
BACKGROUND: Ensuring good quality staff and patient relationships are key goals of long-stay inpatient services. It is therefore essential that staff have a good understanding of patients' needs and how to work with the challenges that can present in these environments. AIMS: We evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a workshop to help psychiatric staff with challenging behaviours. DESIGN: We used a quasi experimental design with assessments carried out at baseline and post intervention. We provided the training to staff on one low secure psychiatric unit and recorded the uptake of outcome assessments and the workshop itself. We assessed staff-patient relationships, burnout and ward atmosphere and staff also completed satisfaction questionnaires. RESULTS: Sixty-six percent of staff (n = 25) who were eligible to participate in the project completed initial outcome measures, but only 42% (n = 16) attended the workshop and only 34% (n = 13) completed follow-up measures. The workshop had no predicted effects on any of the outcomes assessed, but staff satisfaction with the training was generally positive. CONCLUSIONS: Building up positive relationships with staff, addressing negative expectations and seeking support from all levels of management are essential in terms of reducing barriers to training in psychiatric settings.

School staff perceptions of well-being and experience of an intervention to promote mental well-being
AbstractEducational Psychologists (EPs) spend much of their time working with school staff to solve problems. Staff often report perceptions of high levels of stress, overwork and lack of time to plan and implement changes indicating frequent experience of poor mental well-being. There has been a recent increase in awareness of promoting the well-being of children and young people, however, little attention appears to have been focused as yet upon the school staff who will promote and support this agenda.Research in schools has tended to focus on teachers rather than including all staff. There is a preponderance of research clarifying contributors to teachers’ stress and, to a lesser extent describing interventions in schools. However, little research has focused on school staff understanding and value of well-being and about perceptions of interventions carried out in schools. This study aimed to obtain a greater understanding of the perceptions of school staff about well-being, the value they placed upon it and the experience and perceived impact of taking part in a study aiming to promote staff well-being. An 8 week intervention was carried out in a primary school with weekly sessions of a project which was known as ‘Chill and Chat’. Data was gathered via questionnaires completed before and after the project and 3 focus groups held before, during and after the project. Data was analysed using thematic analysis.It was found that well-being was seen as important, however, colleagues with poor mental well-being were ‘pathologised’. ‘Learning’ to cope and maintain positive well-being was perceived as a responsibility of the staff member. Staff perceived the informality of provision to support their well-being as important and valued the time to develop better relationships with colleagues rather than ‘working relationships’ and also feeling valued and cared for. Staff reported perceptions of greater efficacy in the classroom, increased job satisfaction and feeling calmer in the classroom. The most significant limitation of the study was the continuation of provision to support staff mental well-being which requires commitment and understanding from school senior management teams and local authority members regarding the impact that increased well being can have on teaching and learning and a shift of thought towards focusing on positive well-being promotion rather than managing poor well-being.There are implications for EP practice and research in helping school staff reflect on their well-being and actions that they can take as a team to promote well-being in school. EPs can also be instrumental in disseminating research findings highlighting the impact of staff mental well being on teaching and learning.

3D virtual worlds as environments for literacy learning
<b>Background:</b> Although much has been written about the ways in which new technology might transform educational practice, particularly in the area of literacy learning, there is relatively little empirical work that explores the possibilities and problems - or even what such a transformation might look like in the classroom. 3D virtual worlds offer a range of opportunities for children to use digital literacies in school, and suggest one way in which we might explore changing literacy practices in a playful, yet meaningful context.<p></p> <b>Purpose:</b> This paper identifies some of the key issues that emerged in designing and implementing virtual world work in a small number of primary schools in the UK. It examines the tensions between different discourses about literacy and literacy learning and shows how these were played out by teachers and pupils in classroom settings.<p></p><b>Sources of evidence:</b> Case study data are used as a basis for exploring and illustrating key aspects of design and implementation. The case study material includes views from a number of perspectives including classroom observations, chatlogs, in-world avatar interviews with teachers and also pupils, as well as the author’s field notes of the planning process with accompanying minutes and meeting documents.<p></p><b>Main argument:</b> From a Foucauldian perspective, the article suggests that social control of pedagogical practice through the regulation of curriculum time, the normalisation of teaching routines and the regimes of individual assessment restricts teachers’ and pupils’ conceptions of what constitutes literacy. The counternarrative, found in recent work in new litearcies (Lankshear & Knobel, 2006) provides an attractive alternative, but a movement in this direction requires a fundamental shift of emphasis and a re-conceptualisation of what counts as learning.<p></p><b>Conclusions:</b> This work on 3D virtual worlds questions the notion of how transformative practice can be achieved with the use of new technologies. It suggests that changes in teacher preparation, continuing professional development as well as wider educational reform may be needed.

Using online assessment to provide instant feedback
For the past five years we have been using a method inspired by the just-in-time-teachingapproach to teach our first year Newtonian mechanics class, which typically contains 240-280 students. This replaced a standard course, that did not engage the students sufficiently.With such a large cohort, it is difficult to mark students' assessments quickly, and give therequired feedback in a timely manner. We discuss how we capture students‟ marks andcommon difficulties in a short period, so we can plan an example class addressing these.We explain why we have chosen a commercial e-assessment tool. We discuss the types ofassignments available, especially those which allow for algebraic answers, and show whichtypes of assessments were found most effective, and describe the underlying reasons. Wewill specifically discuss the steps that were needed to take to create a positive experiencefor the students—our initial experience was quite negative, and influenced the students'engagement.We discuss in detail the important lessons we have learned about the mechanisms of qualitycontrol that underlie the use of online mathematical assessments. The core step in ourmethod is to use student answers to test the quality of questions. The way of performingquality tests is highly non-trivial and time-consuming, but is crucially important. Finally, weshall discuss further developments that would make this type of rich assessment more usefulto the students.

Secondary teachers' perceptions of the effectiveness of their pre-service education and strategies to improve pre-service education for teachers: A school based training route in England
This study aims to provide a deeper understanding of the impact of an EBITT course on teachers' early professional development, identify strengths of the course and also the ways in which the training could be improved. Data collected was recorded during individual face- to- face interviews using a structured interview schedule. In devising our approach we utilised the model suggested by Sharon Feiman-Nemser in her article How do Teachers Learn to Teach?  in Cochran - Smith et. al.  (2008) Handbook of Research on Teacher Education
The data was analysed to explore (after 2-4 years reflection):
•	which elements of initial training were valuable and less valuable 
•	what they have learned since the course
•	which aspects of the course the teachers feel should be improved
It was cross referenced against findings from national surveys of teachers in their post qualifying year of teaching (induction year) and early years of teaching conducted by the TDA. These findings were presented as part of a common wider international study on the same theme in four countries (UK, Spain, Australia, and Ireland).

Duckworth, V., Ingle, S., and Lord, J. (2012).  Shifting sands and teacher education: preparing future lifelong learning teachers for their first years in professional teaching practice, or preparing them to keep their heads above water?
This collaborative study explores the transitions of three former further education teachers, at different points in their academic careers, into Higher Education teaching.   We suggest that this transition inevitably brings a number of personal and professional challenges. With an increasing move towards performativity via target setting, results and accountability, a great deal of academics’ time and energy is governed by a managerial-driven system based on close scrutiny of paperwork, and increasing emotional labour (e.g. Bathmaker and Avis, 2006) in work environments where job security is unstable due to redundancies and restructuring. This often leaves academics fearful of their job security, exhausted and reluctant to challenge the hegemony based on quantifiable outcomes whereby notions of critical autonomy are side-lined for compliance. The data draws on life history methodology and narrative enquiry.   It explores our stories and the process of what Clough and Nutbrown (2002, p.81) describe as ‘focused conversations’. It moves from viewing society as a disembodied structure, and instead sets our narratives against the backdrop of cultural, historical and political landscape, providing a life history methodology that allows us to make sense of our transitions through our connections.  The intertwining of our narratives provides an insight into how university lecturers engage in shaping a professional identity, and leads us to suggest that communities of practice (Lave and Wenger, 1991, Wenger, 1998, Wenger et al., 2002) can support teachers’ critical autonomy in their early career.

The role of the educational psychologist; perspectives on learning.
This thesis is a collation of three research papers, each of which explores an area of professional relevance to the practitioner educational psychologist.  The research is undertaken in the context of a large, rural Local Authority and is related to the broad theme of cognition and learning in children and young people.   The researcher adopts a Q-methodology to consider the subjective and collective viewpoints of educational psychologists in the Local Authority with regard to dyslexia and using factor analysis to process the data, three distinct viewpoints emerged.  The literature review included in the thesis seeks to provide an overview of the research base which underpins formative assessment practices in educational settings in the UK.  The importance of the role of teacher feedback in classroom learning is illustrated through meta-analyses research and studies.  Formative assessment is considered in the review within the conceptual framework of constructivist learning theory.  The role of pupil feedback in a junior classroom is then explored in a qualitative research study using a collaborative action research methodology.  Thematic analysis is used to analyse the textual data from interviews with the participant teacher.  The action research methodology was an effective model to enable the teacher to effect change in her practice.  The three papers are set within an organisational context in the thesis, current challenges for the profession are summarised and many examples are given of the role and importance of research in the work of an educational psychologist.    Implications for further research within the profession of educational psychology are suggested.

Ecologies of participation in school classrooms
The concept of legitimate peripheral participation was developed by considering informal learning contexts. However, its applicability to school classrooms is problematic. This is particularly so when teacher centred and decontextualised procedural practices predominate as they do in usual school mathematics classrooms. Different meanings of participation in community of practice theory are identified. The applicability of legitimate peripheral participation to school mathematics classrooms is critiqued by considering: the nature of social practice, learning relationships, power, agency, and identity.

It is mediation, not the medium that matters
At a time when teachers have access to a very broad range of technologies for use in their classrooms, it is the choices that teachers make and the way that these choices are deployed and understood that matter most for the outcomes of learners. Introducing a new technology into a classroom involves a number of actions on the part of the teacher, including an assessment of the needs of the learners; a desire to keep the course up-to-date and reflect current industry practice; a decision about the value of a new tool and its final choice; a curriculum that introduces and develops the key issues and skills for using the tool; an on-going dialogue about the assessment process; a set of informed pedagogical processes; and an engagement with other actors within the institution who set up and administer the tool. This is a very complex activity system and if the introduction of this new tool is to be successful, then the teacher needs to expect that there are going to be regular changes to keep the system working effectively and for the learners to keep buying into the process. This paper will explore this system through the case study of a teacher educator making use of WordPress as a Content Management System in a web design course aimed at language and other teachers on an MA module at the University of Manchester.

The use of research to improve professional practice: a systematic review of the literature
<p>In a keynote address to the Teacher Training Agency Annual Conference, Professor David Hargreaves suggested that teaching could become an evidence-based profession if educational researchers were made more accountable to teachers. This systematic literature review set out to explore: how teachers use research; which features of research encourage teachers to use research findings in their own practice; whether medical practitioners make greater use of research findings than teachers; and approaches to dissemination. Two key ideas emerge from this review. First, there appear to be common barriers to research use in both medicine and in education. Findings suggest that there is a need to create a culture in the public sector which supports and values research. There are, however, a number of factors, which appear to be more specific to the education field. Key differences in the way that research knowledge is constructed in the social sciences has led to researchers being challenged about their findings, particularly in relation to the context, generalisability and validity of the research. For these reasons the development of communication networks, links between researchers and practitioners, and greater involvement of practitioners in the research process, have emerged as strategies for improving research impact.</p>

WIRELESS RAY TRACING EDUCATIONAL LAND
Technology has a great impact and influence on the educational process in classroom environments. Students can use the advanced computing and telecommunication technologies, to access different types of information and to communicate with their teachers and colleagues using several types of media. Among the new emerging technologies are online three dimensional virtual worlds (3D VWs). This technology can aid students in understanding and predicting physical behaviour, which would otherwise require interactive simulations and laboratories that may be expensive, time consuming and dangerous. Traditional simulations can help carry out virtual experiments but they are often not very interactive, and are frequently complex and slow. 3D VWs provide a natural interactive exploration environment, where individuals and groups can interact and learn. The prototype Wireless Ray-Tracing Educational Land (WRTEL) was built using the OpenSimulator VWs technology, to improve the learning experience for electrical engineering and physics students studying electromagnetic wireless systems. Instead of using textbooks, pictures, equations and paper examples to understand how wireless signals propagate, signals are visualized in an interactive 3D virtual environment. This paper presents the prototype WRTEL, where invisible wireless signal propagation is made visible using the VW technology. Students are able to visualize signal behaviour (reflection, refraction, diffraction and scattering) in either two dimensions (2D) or three dimensions (3D), and information about each interaction between signals and the surrounding environment can be displayed. The WRTEL consists of three main regions. In the first region, three educational tools have been implemented to explore the relationship between wavelength and frequency, the electromagnetic spectrum and antennas. In the second region, a free space laboratory had been designed in simulated outer space to allow students to visualize line of sight signal propagation between the transmitter and the receiver antennas. In the third region, students are provided with a selectable two or three dimensional ray-tracing laboratory, to create environments using obstacles made from different materials. Students will be able to visualize how signal behaviour (reflection, refraction, diffraction and scattering) is affected by the surrounding environment. Path loss calculations, received power, angle of incidence and many other values will be provided at any point in space until the signal is received by the receiver antenna. The transmitted wireless signals will be visualized by mapping them into the visual spectrum for display; this makes the invisible rays visible. A brief technical and educational evaluation indicated that the prototype educational land was both usable and would support student learning activities in laboratories.

SCHOOL CHOICE-MAKING, MOTHERS’ INVOLVEMENT IN CHILDREN’S EDUCATION AND SOCIAL REPRODUCTION IN THE EDUCATION MARKET IN HONG KONG
This study examines the mechanisms of class disadvantage in educational processes in Hong Kong by focusing on mothers’ secondary school choice-making and everyday educational involvement. My study is located within the context of local neoliberal education reforms in which parents are expected to rely on their own resources to support their children’s learning and all-round development and to exercise school choice. I have drawn upon cultural capital theory and applied to the local context in order to explore how patterns of persistent class differentials in educational outcomes despite expanded educational opportunities are produced in micro-level processes in the local school market. I have also drawn on the insights of the Western literature about how ‘ethnicity’ and gender complicate class processes, and used these to address these issues in the local Hong Kong context. To achieve this, I interviewed 34 local-born and mainland Chinese immigrant mothers, with children aged 11-15, who mostly come from working class and intermediate class backgrounds. My findings about mothers’ educational practices show that class mechanisms generate disadvantage by restricting the access of more disadvantaged mothers to the ‘right’ cultural capital as stipulated by the particular ‘rules of the game’ of the local educational ‘field’. At the same time, my study sheds light on the diversity of the structural and moral contexts in which cultural capital mobilization is embedded and the myriad ways that ‘ethnicity’ and gender interact to aggravate, mitigate, or ameliorate class disadvantage. I underline the need for local researchers to spell out and problematize the institutionalization of class privilege and disadvantage within the education system. At the same time, the study makes a novel contribution to the wider literature by offering an account of class reproduction in Hong Kong which is different in important respects to that found in many other generic accounts which take as their focus advanced ‘Western’ capitalist societies. My findings also highlight the importance of examining the contextual contingency of how cultural capital ‘works’ and so stress the indeterminacy of class processes.

How are doctoral students supervised? Concepts of doctoral research supervision.
<p>Literature about doctoral supervision has concentrated on describing the ever lengthening lists of functions that must be carried out. This functional approach is necessary but there has been little exploration of a different paradigm, a conceptual approach towards research supervision. This paper, based on interviews with supervisors from a range of disciplines, aims to fill this a gap. The main concepts identified are: Functional: where the issue is one of project management; enculturation: where the student is encouraged to become a member of the disciplinary community; critical thinking: where the student is encouraged to question and analyse their work; emancipation: where the student is encouraged to question and develop themselves; and developing a quality relationship: where the student is enthused, inspired and cared for. Supervisors of doctoral students are also trying to reconcile the tensions between their professional role as an academic and their personal self as well as encouraging students to move a long a path towards increasing independence. The concepts are examined in the light of each of these tensions. Finally the research illuminates the power of the supervisor’s own experience as a student and the paper suggests that supervisors need to be aware of both the positive and negative aspects of each of these conceptual approaches.</p>

INTEGRATING INDIGENOUS SKILLS AS PANACEA FOR IMPROVING VOCATIONAL AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN NIGERIA
The paper focused on the need to integrate indigenous skills as panacea for improving Vocational and Technical Education (VTE) in secondary schools in Nigeria. The purposive population was used which comprises of teachers, students and artisans. A random sampling technique was used to select 200 respondents for the study. Descriptive survey research design was used for the study. A twenty- item questionnaire was used to elicit responses from the respondents. Standard deviation and means scores were used to analyze the data. The result shows that the integration of indigenous skills in the teaching and learning of Vocational and Technical Education will improve the quality of skills acquired in schools to a greater extent. The level of acceptability of the infusion of indigenous skills by the stakeholders is very high in the area of exposing students of VTE to practical skills and collaborative efforts. Based on the results of the study, it is recommended among others that Government should provide enabling environment for the integration of indigenous skills for improving vocational and technical education in secondary schools in Nigeria. &nbsp; KEYWORDS: Indigenous skills, Vocational and Technical Education, Collaborative efforts and Enabling Environment.

Sandwich placements in law: academic tourism or a form of clinical legal education?
<p>Whether or not education at the higher level can be integrated with practical experience has preoccupied educationalists in Europe and North America for a considerable time. There are some disciplines in which the existence of laboratory practice or simulated work experience can be used to assist the process of learning-by-doing quite efficiently. In other areas, learning from experience may be best carried out in the employment environment itself. Historically, in the UK this was the pattern for the traditional professions of law, accountancy, medicine and architecture. More recently in the UK, sandwich courses, predominantly a 'new' university contribution to higher education, have been developed to give students a balance between academic theory and practical professional experience. This article attempts a re-evaluation of the sandwich placement model of legal education in law in the light of the skills debate, and the clinical legal education movement.</p>

The impact of an improvised social work method in a school: aspirations, encouragement, realism and openness
A high school in the English West Midlands reduces annual school exclusions from 251 to 6 in three years. A social worker is employed by the school to join the student support services. A new method of brief intervention is introduced by the social worker based on 'aspirations, encouragement, realism and openness' (AERO), summarised by one teacher as helping a conversation develop in which the young people can discuss problems that they would otherwise find difficult. All of this is established with no special pilot project status or resources.<p></p>This article considers the relationship between these factors and evaluates the impact of the AERO method through interviews with key participants — 12 students currently in school and one parent, all of whom had direct experience of the method, and six professionals who experienced the impact of the model. The findings suggest that the philosophy of social inclusion introduced by a new head teacher is sustained by a systematic approach to providing social and personal support to students, and by the use of an effective and efficient practice method. The article discusses the possibilities of transferring the lessons from this study and also the possible limitations of the social work method and the study itself.

Capturing complexities of student leadership: knowledge, power and practicalities
Over the past decade student participation in school leadership has gained prominence in the field of education. However, the concept of ‘student leadership’ remains broad and elusive, allowing many school leaders to misuse it in ways that serve their own needs. Student leadership is defined here as student participation in activities which promote self-advocacy (Lansdown, 2000: 16). There are very few studies which actually examine the relationship between student leadership and school decision-making. This paper reports on a case study of student-led project at an independent high school in England. The students lead a consortium of teachers and administrators at the school to draw up policy recommendation on learning with ICT at the school, which are forwarded to the school’s senior management team. Using the case study as reference, this paper argues that student leadership although full of hopes and aspirations for the future of education, is at present fraught with complexities. These include issues of knowledge: when the roles of learner and teacher are reversed, power: based on who decided what is included in the agendas, and practicalities such as time and resources.Lansdown, G.

Learning strategies in interpreting text: From comprehension to illustration
<p>Learning strategies can be described as behaviours and thoughts a learner engages in during learning that are aimed at gaining knowledge. Learners are, to use Mayer’s (1996) constructivist definition, ‘sense makers’. We can therefore position this to mean that, if learners are sense makers, then learning strategies are essentially cognitive processes used when learners are striving to make sense out of newly presented material. This paper intends to demonstrate that such thoughts and behaviours can be made explicit and that students can co-ordinate the basic cognitive processes of selecting, organising and integrating. I will discuss two learning strategies which were developed during three cycles of an action research enquiry with a group of illustration students. While each cycle had its own particular structure and aims, the main task, that of illustrating a passage of expository text into an illustration was a constant factor. The first learning strategy involved assisting students develop ‘macropropositions’—personal understandings of the gist or essence of a text (Louwerse and Graesser, 2006; Armbruster, Anderson and Ostertag,  1987; Van Dijk & Kintsch, 1983). The second learning strategy used a form of induction categorised as analogical reasoning (Holyoak, 2005; Sloman and Lagnado, 2005). Both strategies were combined to illustrate the expository text extract. The data suggests that design students benefit from a structured approach to learning, where thinking processes and approaches can be identified and accessible for other learning situations.  The research methodology is based on semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, developmental design (including student notes) and final design output. All student names used are pseudonyms. The text extract from ‘Through the Magic Door’ an essay Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, (1907) has been included as it provides context to analysis outcomes, student comments and design outputs.

A description and evaluation of a challenging behaviour workshop.
BACKGROUND: Ensuring good quality staff and patient relationships are key goals of long-stay inpatient services. It is therefore essential that staff have a good understanding of patients' needs and how to work with the challenges that can present in these environments. AIMS: We evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a workshop to help psychiatric staff with challenging behaviours. DESIGN: We used a quasi experimental design with assessments carried out at baseline and post intervention. We provided the training to staff on one low secure psychiatric unit and recorded the uptake of outcome assessments and the workshop itself. We assessed staff-patient relationships, burnout and ward atmosphere and staff also completed satisfaction questionnaires. RESULTS: Sixty-six percent of staff (n = 25) who were eligible to participate in the project completed initial outcome measures, but only 42% (n = 16) attended the workshop and only 34% (n = 13) completed follow-up measures. The workshop had no predicted effects on any of the outcomes assessed, but staff satisfaction with the training was generally positive. CONCLUSIONS: Building up positive relationships with staff, addressing negative expectations and seeking support from all levels of management are essential in terms of reducing barriers to training in psychiatric settings.

The new journeyman:  The role of an expert learner in eliciting and transmitting skilled knowledge
<p>This paper presents interim research findings of a project which seeks to elicit the skilled knowledge of master craftsmen through use of an expert learner (Horne) acting as intermediary between the craftsmen and a designer (Wood) creating a multimedia resource to support those wishing to learn the skill. It builds on previous research that evolved a set of principles for the design of multimedia learning materials (Wood & Rust 2003) and moved on to develop techniques for elicitation of expert knowledge from craft masters (Wood 2006). </p>
<p>
The skills involved in undertaking such craft practice involve a high degree of tacit knowledge which is internalised and frequently difficult for the craft expert to articulate. The expert learner has the ability to learn new skills with minimal instruction then articulate those skills before they become too internalised. The role of designer is to assist with this articulation and develop interpretation suitable for transmitting the knowledge to novice learners.</p>
<p>
This research focuses on the skills of traditional custom knife makers in Sheffield; Horne has worked alongside two traditional craftsmen, video recorded by Wood. Together they have collaborated to analyse the recordings and develop learning materials to disseminate the craft skill. These are currently being developed and tested using a small group of learners with some one-to-one teaching followed by self-directed development work using an on-line resource. </p>
<p>
The main finding for this stage of the research was that, as Horne had relatively recently acquired this knowledge, it had not become too internalised and she was able to rapidly adapt her understanding of it to improve transmission to the learners in a manner that had not been demonstrated by more experienced craft practitioners. The interactions between Horne and the learners were mediated by Wood, facilitating reciprocal reflection between the them and designing ‘bridges’ to help transmit the knowledge to future generations of learners.

The role of school and individual differences in the academic attainment of learners with special educational needs and disabilities: a multi-level analysis.
Students with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) are at a greatly increased risk of poor academic outcomes. Understanding the factors that influence their attainment is a crucial first step towards developing more effective provision. In the current study we present a multi-level, natural variation analysis which highlights important determinants at school and individual levels in two core academic subjects (English and Maths) using a nationally representative sample of over 15,000 students with SEND attending more than 400 schools across England. We found that at the school level, inclusivity, attainment, free school meal (FSM) eligibility, behaviour (in primary schools) and linguistic diversity (secondary schools), and at the student level, age, sex, FSM eligibility, SEND provision, SEND primary need, attendance, behaviour and positive relationships each contributed to the distribution of academic attainment. Implications of these findings are discussed and study limitations are noted.

Digital or didactic: Using learning technology to confront the challenge of large cohort teaching
This paper investigates whether the selective use of technology can begin to overcome the challenge of large cohort teaching and deliver an enhanced student learning experience. It describes the initial development and evaluation of a campus-based management course taught to 270 third year engineering undergraduates at The University of Manchester. The course is structured around weekly keynote lectures, supplemented with extensive use of a virtual learning environment (VLE) and key Web 2.0 applications.The preliminary findings are that technology is not a panacea: face-to-face contact with teaching staff remains the priority for most students. Nevertheless, the VLE was found to improve the student learning experience provided that    •     Use of technology does not reduce face-to-face teaching time;    •     Teaching faculty acknowledges that students are, for the most part, highly strategic learners, engaging deeper with those technology tools that help them achieve their desired course outcomes;    •     Close attention is paid to learning design, aligning technology tools with the desired learning outcomes.Further work is now required to explore more effectively the use of the VLE and Web 2.0 as a vehicle for promoting collaborative learning. In addition, the authors will be redesigning course activities, both assessed and unassessed, to start to address the more lofty ambition of moving students from an acquisitive to a participative model of learning.Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic    •     There is an ongoing debate about the effectiveness of learning technology in enhancing the student learning experience.    •     There are a number of published case studies describing and evaluating the effectiveness of VLEs in enhancing student learning across a range of disciplines, the majority of which involve small- to medium-sized cohorts.    •     Learning technology can be used to achieve more constructivist pedagogical principles.What this paper adds    •     A well-conducted case study of the use of learning technology to enhance large cohort teaching.    •     A critical review of the literature on the use of learning technology to enhance student learning.    •     An empirical contribution to the debate on whether learning technology can enhance the student learning experience.Implications for practice and/or policy    •     Technology is not a panacea to enable higher education institutions to do more with less.    •     Technology can enhance the student learning experience provided that it does not reduce face-to-face teaching time.    •     In utilising learning technology, close attention should be paid to learning design, aligning technology tools with the desired learning outcomes.

Using The Views Of Marginalised Students About Effective Teaching
Schools often find problem behaviour difficult to address due to an overabundance of research and methods in this area.  For a variety of reasons, wavering on this matter is based on multiple reform initiatives that compete and intersect.  A solution to this indecisiveness finds a high proportion of adolescents, who are considered to be deviant by their teachers, excluded from mainstream classes and placed in alternative learning environments. These placements promise academic intervention, but tend to only address issues of self‐esteem through behaviour modification.  As a result, these students remain in a skills‐deficit position that threatens their self‐esteem and provokes their original deviance.  The study reported in this thesis considers this issue and its relationship to student voice.  In so doing, it challenges exclusion as a way of addressing negative behaviour by looking at school experiences from the perspectives of students considered to be deviant to discover and examine the common places where they have found success.Bearing this argument in mind, this one-year study set out to find areas in a school in the United States that students labeled with a behaviour difficulty might identify as positive learning environments. The specific focus was designing and implementing a methodology that used action research to more accurately identify literature to address the specific needs and concerns of the students under scrutiny. It used school tours to help participants identify areas of success, as a basis for interviews, and as a direction for teacher observations. The voices of these marginalized students produced common categories that identified possible paths to reform. They were able to identify several successful components of lesson planning and general concerns that challenged the school’s culture. The implications of these findings are a significant step forward to what we know about the workings of inclusive classrooms, the teachers who find success in them, and how students come to be labeled with a behaviour difficulty.

Orthodontic teaching practice and undergraduate knowledge in British dental schools.
AIM: The aim was to survey current orthodontic teaching practice in the undergraduate syllabus at British dental schools and to test the abilities of undergraduate students according to the requirements of the GDC regulations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Information collected by means of a questionnaire sent to each dental school in 1998 was compared with similar data from 1994. The orthodontic knowledge and treatment planning ability of students was assessed by a multiple-choice examination paper completed by a random 10% sample of students from each dental school. RESULTS: In 1998 on average 195 curriculum hours were devoted to orthodontics and each student treated five patients. The teaching of fixed appliances had increased considerably between 1994 and 1998. The average MCQ score was 58% (range 39-72%). Students scored well on questions that tested basic knowledge but much less well when they were required to apply that knowledge. Only three schools felt that it was realistic to expect undergraduates to formulate orthodontic treatment plans, as they are required to do by the GDC. CONCLUSION: Results support the view that undergraduate orthodontic training should concentrate on diagnosis and recognition of problems rather than on providing limited exposure to treatment techniques.

Student as researchers: student leadership of school ICT policymaking
While the body of research on student voice focusing mainly on the rights of students as espoused in the UN (1989) Convention on the Rights of the Child has grown, little work has been done on the relationship between students and leadership (Mitra and Gross, 2009). The impetus for this study are arguments of Smyth (2006), which suggest that it is time for schools to move away from old regimes to a different kind of educational leadership that encourages authentic forms of student participation. He proposes ‘learner-centred policy generation’ as a more inclusive, more democratic way of generating school policies.   Such arguments are akin to Luckin’s (2008) plea for the development of learner-generated contexts in educational technology, which she argues is a ‘more democratic learning economy ... where the balance between learner and teacher or mentor control is constantly changing’ (p 461). Her arguments hinge on the fact that we are now faced with the situation in schools where many students know more than their teachers about digital learning tools. Democracy itself has been described as fragile (Osler and Starkey, 2006 p 433) partly because there is much variation in its scope, and in its interpretation, and also because democratic practice needs continual validation if it is to be successful. But undoubtedly the essence of democracy is the exposure of different perspectives, which makes it worth aspiring for in the school setting.In this presentation I report on a study that examines the extent to which an ethos of shared planning and decision-making might be developed through student leadership, to improve learning with ICT at an independent secondary school in England. 25 students (referred to as student researchers) aged between 14 and 19 at the school participate in an action research project to develop policy recommendations on how to improve teaching and learning with ICT, which they present to the school’s senior management team. I give an account of the process of organising these students as researchers and on some of the consequences of their involvement. Methodology, Methods, Research Instruments or Sources UsedThe student researchers were volunteers from three sections of my computer applications course. During 2009–2010 they designed questionnaires used to survey teachers and students at the school. Using action research methodology they met regularly with the High School Technology Consortium—a group consisting of administrators, teachers and student council representatives—to reflect on the data collected. There were four cycles in the action research project, during which they gathered and discussed the opinions of students and teachers at the school, and the ICT practices at other international schools. The consortium, which served as ‘critical friends’, worked with the student researchers to develop the policy recommendations. As a researching professional, I conducted a case study of the action research project in order to gather a range of perceptions about involving students in school ICT policymaking, and to understand the willingness of students and staff at the school to work together to improve ICT for the beneficiaries. Data collection for took place between 2009 and 2012. Three rounds of semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants of the project. In addition, observations conducted during meetings and relevant documents, including media coverage, internal publications and pages from group and school websites, were analysed. Conclusions, Expected Outcomes or FindingsInitial findings indicate that (a) students have a desire to play a leading role in ICT for learning, (b) teachers and administrators are willing to share power with them in the process of developing school ICT policy, and (c) there is need for an atmosphere of shared planning and decision-making about teaching and learning with ICT in school. It is suggested that this project also has implications for the ways in which educational professionals understand and work to include students as active citizens within the school community.

Technology and literacy in early childhood educational settings: a review of research
This literature review provides an overview of research into technology and literacy for children aged 0-8 in educational settings from 2003-2009. The paper begins by exploring the different assumptions about the role of digital texts that underpin the studies considered, identifying three loose categories of studies which position technology as: deliverer of literacy; site for interaction around texts; and medium for meaning-making. Following this, actor-network theory (Latour, 2005) is used to consider other ways that technology and children may be ‘acting upon’ literacy in educational settings through recontexualising meanings from other domains. The paper concludes by arguing that there is a need for more extensive exploratory research in this field, which considers how digital practices within educational settings relate to other dimensions of children’s literacy learning, in order to better understand how new technologies are and could be contributing to children’s literacy within educational settings.  It also suggests that actor-network theory may offer a way of destabilising the assumptions that frame research into young children’s engagement with new technologies in order to conceptualise this in new ways.

ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION AT THE UNIVERSAL BASIC EDUCATION (UBE) IN NIGERIA: IMPACT ON ATTITUDE OF PRIMARY SCHOOL PUPILS TOWARDS ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION AND PROTECTION
The nine-year basic education curriculum was reviewed to incorporate environmental education (though infused into several subjects) in line with the ideals of National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS), the millennium development goals (MDG) and the goals of Education for All (EFA).This study investigates the level of knowledge and understanding of basic environmental issues as presented in the Universal Basic Education (UBE) curriculum and the attitude of pupils towards the environment. Four hundred (400) primary school pupils from twenty schools were randomly selected from Port Harcourt metropolis. Simple means and percentages were applied in making inferences about the group under study and findings show that 56.18% have clearer understanding of environmental issues by disagreeing with the negative statements on environment presented to them. On the contrary, as low as 39.3% have positive attitude towards the environment against 60.7% with negative attitude and only 5% accepted that there is environmental conservation club in their school. Appropriate recommendations were made to improve on the existing situation and make our children who are tomorrow's leaders, develop positive attitude towards the environment and then encourage friends and family to do same.&nbsp; &nbsp; KEYWORDS: The millennium development goals (MDG), National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS), Universal Basic Education (UBE), Education for All (EFA), Nigeria

Web 2.0, new literacies, and the idea of learning through participation
In this paper I identify some current elaborations on the theme of participation and digital literacy in order to open further debate on the relationship between interaction, collaboration, and learning in online environments. Motivated by an interest in using new technologies in the context of formal learning (Merchant, 2009), I draw on in-school and out-of-school work in Web 2.0 spaces. This work is inflected by the new literacies approach (Lankshear and Knobel, 2006a), and here I provide an overview of the ways in which learning through participation is characterised by those adopting this and other related perspectives. I include a critical examination of the idea of ‘participatory’ culture as articulated in the field of media studies, focusing particularly on the influential work of Jenkins (2006a; 2006b). In order to draw these threads together around conceptualizations of learning, I summarise ways in which participation is described in the literature on socially-situated cognition. This is used to generate some tentative suggestions about how learning and literacy in Web 2.0 spaces might be envisioned and how ideas about participation might inform curriculum planning and design.

Rank and File: managing individual performance in university research
League tables are a common way for various competitive sports to judge team quality and identify winners and are also making increasingly frequent appearances in higher education globally. In this paper, we argue that this compilation of league tables is a product of the global hegemony of market-driven systems of higher education in which universities compete with each other for declining resources and students-as-customers. We explore why and how such exercises shape and define conceptualisations of the relative strength of organisations, and what the consequences of this are likely to be. Our analysis is grounded in a conceptualisation of universities, particularly in the UK, as marketised, neo-liberal institutions for which rankings are essential to organisational transformation. We provide empirical data to support our argument via an exploration of the UK Association of Business Schools' Academic Journal Quality Guide.

Student help seeking from pastoral care in UK high schools: a qualitative study
Background Little is known about high school students' perceptions of school-based pastoral support. This study aimed to explore this in the context of a high school–based emotional support project. Methods Qualitative interviews explored perspectives on help seeking of students (N = 23) and staff (N = 27) in three UK high schools where a pastoral project was introduced. Data were analysed thematically. Results Student peer groups perceived help seeking as a sign of weakness. However, students valued learning skills in managing emotions and friendships. Staff expressed concerns about students' ability to help seek proactively, and highlighted organisational influences on pastoral support. Conclusions Increasing student control over the process, and involving trusted staff, could encourage help seeking in high school. It is possible to access the views of students who do not help seek, to improve understanding of help-seeking behaviour.

Designing for tacit learning: an investigation of design strategies for multimedia supported learning in the crafts
<p>There is an increasing interest and activity in the design of interactive multimedia to support learning in all fields of education and training. However, most of the theory to support such developments is concerned with learning explicit knowledge and there is little guidance available to designers of material for learning in areas with an element of tacit knowledge such as craft skills. </p>
<p>This paper describes the foundation work for a long-term project concerned with learning in traditional rural crafts but with the intention to provide a methodological framework for the design of multimedia-based learning in all areas of craft knowledge. </p>
<p>A review of established theory of learning and the use of multimedia for learning in areas of explicit knowledge indicates some important basic principles, for example the need to understand the interaction between the teacher and learner in the context of the subject being taught and the need for clear narrative structures to avoid students becoming "lost" in the multiple pathways of interactive media. </p>
<p>Observational studies of learning using educational video in a craft context and a study of an experienced craftsman/teacher teaching a group of learners, complemented by study of learning in related contexts, have allowed problems and issues to be identified and design strategies to be developed. While these are provisional they provide an overview of the design problems and have been used to plan a programme of experimental design and evaluation to test and develop principles of effective multimedia design for craft learning. </p>

A discourse analysis of trainee teacher identity in online discussion forums
Teacher education involves an identity transformation for trainees from being a student to being a teacher. This discourse analysis examined the online discussion board communications of a cohort of trainee teachers to better understand the situated identities of the trainees and how they were presented online. Their discussion board posts were the primary method of communication during placement periods and, as such, provided insight into how the trainees situated their identities in terms of being a student or being a teacher. During the analysis, the community boundaries, language and culture were explored along with the tutor's power and role in the identity transformation process. This involved looking at the lexis used by the students, the use of pronouns to refer to themselves and others such as teachers and pupils, the types of messages allowed in the community and the effect of the tutor's messages on their communication. The research found that the trainees felt comfortable with teaching but did not feel like teachers during the course. Tutors and school teachers need to develop an awareness of the dual nature of trainees' identities and help promote the transition from student to teacher. In the beginning of the course, trainees should be familiarised with teacher vocabulary and practical concepts in addition to pedagogical theory. Towards the end of the course, trainee identity as teachers could be promoted through the use of authentic assessments that mirror real teacher tasks and requirements.

Introduction of student initiated and themed multi-student projects
We present the background to a change in the delivery and supervision of third year projects for students majoring in electrical and electronic engineering at Manchester University and an evaluation of our experience with this new system. One of the recent changes in the delivery of projects has been to task a smaller number of staff dedicated to the supervision of third year projects. Balancing the increased demand on staff supervising third year individual projects with increasing the quality of supervision has prompted us to change the delivery mode of third year projects. One of the main initiatives is to group individual projects under a ‘theme’ that will offer places for approximately six to ten students working under supervision of an academic member of staff usually with assistance of a research group member. Although students still perform an individual piece of work they benefit from joint training on (for example) software tools, the use of equipment, key techniques and higher levels of peer support. We will reflect on the organization of the themed projects, project allocation, their delivery, supervision and support structures that we have put in place. An evaluation of demands on staff time, student experience and preparation overhead will also be presented.

Computational Support for Learners of Arabic
This thesis documents the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) and its contribution to the learning experience of students studying Arabic as a foreign language. The goal of this project is to build an Intelligent Computer Assisted Language Learning (ICALL) system that provides computational assistance to learners of Arabic by teaching grammar, producing homework and issuing students with immediate feedback. To produce this system we use the Parasite system, which produces morphological, syntactic and semantic analysis of textual input, and extend it to provide error detection and diagnosis. The methodology we adopt  involves relaxing constraints on unification so that correct information contained in a badly formed sentence may still be used to obtain a coherent overall analysis. We look at a range of errors, drawn from experience with learners at various levels, covering word internal problems (addition of inappropriate affixes, failure to apply morphotactic rules properly) and problems with relations between words (local constraints on features, and word order problems). As feedback is an important factor in learning, we look into different types of feedback that can be used to evaluate which is  the most appropriate for the aim of our system.

A description and evaluation of a challenging behaviour workshop.
Background Ensuring good quality staff and patient relationships are key goals of long-stay inpatient services. It is therefore essential that staff have a good understanding of patients' needs and how to work with the challenges that can present in these environments. Aims We evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a workshop to help psychiatric staff with challenging behaviours. Design We used a quasi experimental design with assessments carried out at baseline and post intervention. We provided the training to staff on one low secure psychiatric unit and recorded the uptake of outcome assessments and the workshop itself. We assessed staff-patient relationships, burnout and ward atmosphere and staff also completed satisfaction questionnaires. Results Sixty-six percent of staff (n = 25) who were eligible to participate in the project completed initial outcome measures, but only 42% (n = 16) attended the workshop and only 34% (n = 13) completed follow-up measures. The workshop had no predicted effects on any of the outcomes assessed, but staff satisfaction with the training was generally positive. Conclusions Building up positive relationships with staff, addressing negative expectations and seeking support from all levels of management are essential in terms of reducing barriers to training in psychiatric settings.

Why, what, and how? case study on law, risk, and decision making as necessary themes in built environment teaching
<p>The paper considers (and defends) the necessity of including legal studies as a core part of built environment undergraduate and postgraduate curricula. The writer reflects upon his own experience as a lawyer working alongside and advising built environment professionals in complex land remediation and site safety management situations in the United Kingdom and explains how themes of liability, risk, and decision making can be integrated into a practical simulation in order to underpin more traditional lecture-based law teaching. Through reflection upon the writer's experiments with simulation-based teaching, the paper suggests some innovations that may better orientate law teaching to engage these themes and, thereby, enhance the relevance of law studies to the future needs of built environment professionals in practice.</p>

The views of five participating undergraduate students of the Student Associates Scheme in England
This paper reports findings from a study which explored undergraduate perceptions of the Student Associates Scheme in England (SAS). The scheme was established by the Training and Development Agency for Schools in an attempt to increase the number of graduates entering the teaching profession, particularly in shortage subjects such as the physical sciences and mathematics. The scheme places undergraduate students on short-term placements in secondary schools throughout England to provide them with experiences that may encourage them to consider teaching as a career option. Findings show that the SAS school placements were a positive experience for the students participating in this study. However, a question emerged as to whether or not the scheme is targeting students who have yet to decide upon teaching as a career or just reinforcing the existing aspirations of students who have already decided to teach. As the scheme is attempting to increase the number of teachers entering the profession this question has important implications for this study and further work which will focus on undergraduates who think that their career ambitions would not be fulfilled by teaching.

Controlling the Discipline: Education, Intention, Assumption, Prejudice
<p>This paper explores, from a philosophical and speculative rather than empirical perspective, and within the design disciplines in general, the complex relationships, between practice and education, and their respective assumptions and prejudices. The paper begins by characterising design education from three perspectives: first, education 'about' the discipline, in the sense of providing information that explicates the general disciplinary ‘content’ and focus; second, education 'for' the discipline, which usually accords to notions of training; and third, education as the ‘instilling’ of discipline itself, the elucidation and establishment of rigour and control. It then explores the nature of disciplinary 'for practice' education and sets out the extensive range of presumptions which often underlies the relationship between education and practice. Examining the current relationship between disciplinary education and tertiary studies, the paper looks at critical inquiry and disciplinary research, before focusing on competing institutional values and their operational and material consequences.  The paper concludes with the example of architectural education's response to the demise of modernism, and at the lessons that might be learned from such educational change.

Medium for empowerment or a 'centre for everything': students’ experience of control in digital environments within a university context
In maximising opportunities to nurture rich and productive learning communities, there is a need to know more about the cultures and sub-cultures that surround virtual learning environments (VLEs). Drawing from a small-scale interview study of students’ digital practices, this paper explores how different discourses may have patterned a group of students’ experiences of VLEs. Unlike studies which have focused upon evaluations of specific projects or interventions, this study investigated their experience across their course. It explores the student identities they associated with digital environments and the power relationships which seemed to pattern how they positioned themselves (or felt positioned) as learners. Whilst none were intimidated by technical aspects, the student identities available to them seemed to vary, as did their perceptions of the student identities associated with university-sponsored digital environments. The analysis considers three aspects of their experience:  how they related to the VLE itself, how they related to others through this, and the alternative communities they created to attempt to manage their engagement with the VLE. The paper concludes by arguing for further research which focuses on the broader student experience across courses in order to explore how university-based digital environments intersect with students’ identities as learners.

Primary Teachers’ Attitudes and Knowledge Regarding Gifted Pupils and Their Education in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
For many years, concern has been expressed about the quality of gifted education offered around the world. In response to these concerns, many countries, including Saudi Arabia, have introduced gifted education programmes in primary, intermediate and secondary schools. Current international research suggests that the attitude and knowledge of teachers regarding gifted pupils and their education is a key factor that determines the success of such programmes. However, little is known about the success of the Saudi government initiative as there is a dearth of studies that focus on teacher attitudes and knowledge of gifted pupils and their education. The aim of this study is to investigate the attitudes and knowledge, training needs and attitudes towards in-service gifted training programmes of regular teachers (RTs) and gifted programme teachers (GPTs) towards gifted pupils and their education in primary schools in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The researcher has used mixed methods for collecting data obtained from questionnaires distributed to, and semi-structured interviews with, a sample of 233 GPTs and 700 RTs for the questionnaire and 20 GPTs and 20 RTs for the semi-structured interview, both based on a multi-stage sampling technique.The overall findings indicated that both groups of primary teachers held overall ‘slightly’ positive attitudes towards gifted pupils and their education, with higher positive attitudes among GPTs than RTs. However, there were significant differences between RTs and GPTs in overall knowledge and training needs regarding the gifted and gifted education, with higher knowledge in all topics for GPTs and high training needs for RTs in most gifted knowledge topics. In addition, there were significant differences between RTs and GPTs in their attitudes regarding in-service gifted training programmes, with an ‘ambivalent’ attitude level from GPTs and a ‘very negative’ attitude level from RTs. There were significant positive relationships between teacher attitudes and teacher knowledge regarding the gifted and gifted education. The analysis of semi-structured interview data provided evidence of the validity of the questionnaire results and illustrated the reasons behind positive or negative teacher attitudes and high or low teacher knowledge.Based on the findings, the researcher makes several recommendations and offers possible directions for future research.
