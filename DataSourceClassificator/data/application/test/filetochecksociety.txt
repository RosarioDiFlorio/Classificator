Shared Immigrant Journeys and Inspirational Life Lessons: Critical Reflections on Immigrant Punjabi Sikh Mothers' Participation in Their Children's Schooling
By 2040, one out of three children in the United States will come from immigrant households (Suárez-Orozco et al, 2008). It is imperative to understand how immigrant parents participate in their children's schooling.  This study examined the dynamic ways immigrant parents participated in schools, which did not conform to conventional notions of parental involvement. Previous research studies showed that immigrant parents used their knowledge and skills to participate in effective ways in order to maintain high educational expectations. However, more research was needed to illuminate how immigrant parents transmitted social values regarding the importance of education. This qualitative study utilized the immigrant Punjabi Sikh community in California as a case study for immigrant parental participation.  Ethnographic interviews were conducted with immigrant mothers and their children from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds in order to describe how Punjabi Sikh mothers from three migration periods in California participated in their children's schooling by transmuting obstacles and triumphs into educational messages. These messages were saturated with human and social capital acquired through a shared immigrant journey with their children. Knowledge and skills gained through difficult experiences of integrating into American society, such as English language issues, domestic violence, and navigating the job market, were used as fulcrums for developing positive messages containing the value of education. Theoretical frameworks and methods of inquiry such as, "funds of knowledge," "community cultural wealth," "standpoint theory," and "grounded theory" were used. The significance of this project lies in conceptualizing immigrant women's experiences in more dynamic terms that do not re-victimize women, but, instead, highlight their agency. Immigrant parental participation can be better understood as a social process through which human and social capital within Communities of Color is cultivated and leveraged in order to achieve educational goals through a collective familial effort. This does not mean that immigrant parents do not participate in traditional activities within schools, but that these activities are not their primary ways of participating in their children's schooling. Therefore, focusing only on traditional notions of parental involvement do a disservice by overlooking the inherent strengths within these families, which can be maximized to build a more equitable American educational system.

Salsa Epistemology: Negotiating the Present and the Utopic in the Work of Erika Lopez
Queer theory has been at the forefront of theorizations of utopia in the past ten years, with theorists such as José Esteban Muñoz and Jack Halberstam articulating how utopic creations—such as theatre, art, or even children’s animated films—can have an important function in social change. The field has been reluctant, however, to articulate the relationship between utopia and the vast majority of queer and feminist scholarship, which looks at social activism as a matter of resisting oppression in the present. This paper argues that articulating this link—between the present and utopia—is neither a simple nor a trivial matter, nor is it sufficient to just assume it exists. If, as queer theory has suggested, creating utopias is important for queer subjects, then how do these utopias engage with the everyday business of resisting oppressive social norms?
      This paper seeks to answer this question by close-reading theories of utopianism in the works of José Esteban Muñoz, María Lugones and Chela Sandoval. It then turns to Puerto Rican-American writer/performer/graphic novelist, Erika Lopez, whose a-typical use of humor inThe Girl Must Die(2010) exemplifies a negotiation of both the present and utopia to deal with issues of queer Latinidad. Lopez’s work reveals a way of knowing rooted specifically in Spanish Caribbean cultural texts, which combines present-based resistance and utopic creation dialectically. I term this way of knowing “salsa epistemology”—a reference to salsa as a Caribbean dance form embodied in the present but simultaneously accessing the utopic dimensions of performance.

The Making and the Unmaking of the Modern Subject in British Literature of the Long Eighteenth Century
The individual who first emerges in eighteenth-century England is new, but the subjectivity he or she bears is not. My dissertation returns to the work of John Dryden, Eliza Haywood, Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, and Maria Edgeworth in order to recover the royal prehistory of a model of individuality that has progressed from its origins in eighteenth-century England to become a central element of global commercial life in the twenty-first century. I celebrate the progression of this consumer society as the means through which the divine sovereignty of kings has become a popular right of humanity. I criticize consumer society and its subjects only for failing to affirm the sovereign potential that lies at their foundation. As I demonstrate in my readings of poetry and novels from the long eighteenth century, British literature simultaneously helped to democratize this royal form of being and to construct the ideologies of domesticity that continue to encourage modern individuals to pretend that that they were never made sovereign, that is severed from the stable selves and communities of mere things. My first chapter reads Dryden's "To My Honour'd Kinsman" (1700) alongside "Astraea Redux" (1660) and "To His Sacred Majesty" (1661) in order to argue that Dryden models his late figure of the "patriot" after his earlier image of the king as an at once mortal and immortal entity. While Dryden develops the patriot in the hopes of achieving social unity, my second chapter argues that the heroines of Defoe's Moll Flanders (1722) and Haywood's Fantomina (1725) demonstrate the subversive potential of bodies endowed with the wholly unnecessary and abstract aura of a sovereign individual. In my central third chapter on Clarissa (1747-8), I hail the struggle of Richardson's heroine to masochistically dissolve her modern self and withdraw from society as a Protestant-inspired campaign to achieve the truly sovereign feat of self-dissolution. Though my project ultimately affirms modernity, my final chapter celebrates the pre-modern multitude's interruption of the culminating moment of Edgeworth's The Absentee (1812) as an expression of the inevitable opposition that modernization will meet as it continues to subsume the globe.

Democracy and Economic Demands in Russia and Ukraine: Lessons for Democratic Theory
My dissertation makes the case that learning from and critically engaging with lay political thinking should be an integral part of democratic theory. Specifically, I explore how democratic theory can engage critically with lay Ukrainian and Russian beliefs about democracy that feature a strong emphasis on economic demands, which is unusual from the standpoint of leading scholarly conceptions.  I suggest that such lay expectations are about gaining what T.H. Marshall called social citizenship and autonomy.  These economic demands are democratic because they encompass attempts to gain power and collective control over crucial social institutions and forces in the economy that affect people's lives.  I highlight several aspects of democratic theory that point to the need to take seriously lay people's own ideas about politics. Democratic theorists should take the rational and deliberative capacity of lay actors seriously because democracy involves collective popular control over crucial social institutions and forces, inclusion, full citizenship, the free exchange of ideas, and equality among listeners and speakers.  In a democracy, rights and laws should not be an imposition but rather authorized by the people themselves.  As a form of government that rests on popular power, democracy broadly encompasses a principle of participation of constituents in the direction of political life. One way to understand participation, I argue, is by thinking about it as an opportunity for individual and collective self-expression, where lay actors contribute to interpreting their social world by stating their grievances, demands, hopes, or aspirations. Moreover, historically democracy has been contested and redefined not only by experts and elites, but often by lay actors themselves through social movements.

Evolution of the suborder Blennioidei : phylogeny and phylogeography of a shallow water fish clade
The perciform suborder Blennioidei comprises six families, 151 genera and 883 species. In Chapter 1, I analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of 160 blennioids and ten gobiesocids as the outgroup with one mitochondrial and four nuclear DNA markers. According to the consensus of Bayesian, Maximum Likelihood, and Maximum Parsimony analyses, the monophylies of the six families are supported except for the Labrisomidae and Chaenopsidae. The globally distributed families Tripterygiidae and Blenniidae, are the basal clades branched out of the blennioids. Relationships of the remaining families are partially resolved with the two temperate lineages, the tribe Cryptotremini (Labrisomidae) and the family Clinidae, positioned at the base. Our data suggest that the three Labrisomus subgenera Brockius, Gobioclinus, and Labrisomus should be recognized as separate genera. The recent expansion of the Chaenopsidae with the inclusion of Neoclinus, Mccoskerichthys, and Stathmonotus is not supported. Relationships of the mostly New World family Chaenopsidae are further investigated with additional 145 morphological characters in Chapter 2. The phylogeny based on the combined molecular and morphological dataset supports the monophyly of the subfamily Chaenopsinae and all included genera, but partially agrees with the formerly hypothesized inter-generic relationships based on morphology. Four major clades were identified. The genus Coralliozetus is sister to the remaining three clades which have unresolved relationships. Chaenopsids show higher-than-average genetic variation, therefore are ideal models for studying evolutionary mechanisms. In Chapter 3, a Gulf of California endemic chaenopsid Acanthemblemaria crockeri is shown to have a species-level divergence with subsequent differentiation based on two mitochondrial markers (COI and d-loop). The geographical boundary between the northern "Gulf" and southern "Cape" species roughly corresponds to a hypothetical Pliocene seaway north of the La Paz. Surprisingly, this pattern is not congruent with the well-recognized northern melanic and southern red color morphs. Another speciation event is confirmed from the A. hancocki species group. In Chapter 4, two mitochondrial and one nuclear intron markers were used to discover a new species endemic to the Gulf of California. Acanthemblemaria hastingsi sp. nov. is separated from its sister species A. macrospilus, by the Sinaloan Gap and differ in head and dorsal-fin color pattern

Essential Dimension of Finite Groups
In this thesis we study the essential dimension of the first Galois cohomology functors of finite groups. Following the result by N. A. Karpenko and A. S. Merkurjev about the essential dimension of finite p-groups over a field containing a primitive p-th root of unity, we compute the essential dimension of finite cyclic groups and finite abelian groups over a field containing all primitive p-th roots of unity for all prime divisors p of the order of the group. For the computation of the upper bound of the essential dimension we apply the techniques about affine group schemes, and for the lower bound we make use of the tools of canonical dimension and fibered categories. We also compute the essential dimension of small groups over the field of rational numbers to illustrate the behavior of essential dimension when the base field does not contain all relevant primitive roots of unity.

Why Working Women Drive Alone: Implications for Travel Reduction Programs
A study was funded by the U.S. Department of Labor to analyze the differential impact of mandatory trip reduction programs on employed men and women in different family situations. Travel demand management (TDM) programs can be expected to have a direct impact on working women with young children, who compose the largest component of the growth in the use of the car in the last two decades. The study found that in Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona, men and women had different travel patterns, even when controlling for marital status and the presence of children of various ages, as well as income and occupation. Having children had far more impact on working mothers than on comparable working fathers. Women with children were more likely to drive to work at all income levels than were comparable men or other women. The younger their children and the more children they had, the more likely women were to drive to work alone. Conversely, the more and the younger their children, the less likely working women were to use alternate modes. The findings indicate how dependent working mothers are on the car to balance their domestic and child care obligations and the need to identify the equity consequences of specific TDM requirements, to develop sets of TDM measures that respond to the time and cost constraints of working women, and to develop ways to offset the negative impacts on working mothers.

Assessing California's workers' compensation policy : welfare implications for injured workers
This paper examines the reforms made to California's Workers' Compensation (WC) law between 2002 and 2004. During the pre-reform period employers in California faced the largest average WC premiums in the nation, whereas the post-reform period saw decreases in injuries, cost per claim and premiums. We assess the impact of the reforms on employees by examining the propensity to seek care for minor injuries before and after the reforms and reveal who bore the incidence of reforms. We test for a change in propensity to seek care via the ̀M̀onday effect" often documented in the literature and examine if the prevalence of Monday claims changed after the reform years. We also examine the incidence of the reforms by revealing if reductions in Workers' Compensation insurance premiums were passed-through to the worker in the form of higher real wages. We use a control state and apply the difference-in-differences method to measure the effects in California relative to the counter-factual. We control for occupational risk by creating an index of relative risk by occupation for each state and find that wages in California increased during the post-reform period relative to our control group. In our intra-state comparison, we find that relative to low-risk industries, workers in high risk industries experienced decreases in their wages despite a decrease in the average WC premium

Time Inconsistency, Expectations and Technology Adoption: The Case of Insecticide Treated Nets
Economists have recently argued that time inconsistency may play a central role in explaining intertemporal behavior, particularly among poor households. However, time-preference parameters are typically not identified in standard dynamic choice models and little is known about the fraction of inconsistent agents in the population. We formulate a dynamic discrete choice model in an unobservedly heterogeneous population of possibly time-inconsistent agents motivated by specifically collected information combined with a field intervention in rural India. We identify and estimate all time-preference parameters as well as the population fractions of time-consistent and “naive" and “sophisticated" time-inconsistent agents. We estimate that time-inconsistent agents account for more than half of the population and that “sophisticated" inconsistent agents are considerably more present-biased than their “naive" counterparts. We also examine whether there are other differences across types (e.g. in risk and cost preferences) and find that these differences are small relative to the differences in time preferences.

Ten years of Frequent Users in an Urban Emergency Department
Introduction: The purpose of this study was to determine if differences could be detected in the presentation patterns and admission rates among frequent emergency department users (FEDU) of an urban emergency department over a 10-year period.
      Methods: This was an IRB approved, retrospective review of all patients who presented to the ED 5 or more times for 3 distinct time periods: “year 0” 11/98-10/99, “year 5” 11/03–10/04, and “year 10” 11/08–10/9. FEDU were grouped into those with 5–9, 10–14, 15–19, and ≥ 20 visits per year. Variables analyzed included number of visits, disposition, and insurance status. We performed comparisons using Kolmogorov-Smirnov and chi-square tests. AP< 0.05 was considered significant.
      Results: We found a a 66% increase in FEDU patients over the decade studied, with a significant increase in both the number of FEDU in each visit frequency category over the 3 time periods (P< 0.0001), as well as the total number of visits by each group of FEDU (P< 0.0001). The proportion of FEDU visits for the 5–9 group resulting in admission increased from 25.9% to 29% from year 0 to year 10 (P< 0.001), but not for the other visit groups. In comparing admission rates between FEDU groups, the admission rate for the 5–9 group was significantly higher than the ≥ 20 group for the year 5 time period (P< 0.001) and the year 10 time period (P< 0.001) and showed a similar trend, but not significant, at year 0 (P= 0.052). The overall hospital admission rate for emergency patients over the same time span remained stable at 22-24%. The overall proportion of uninsured FEDU was stable over the decade studied, while the uninsured rate for the overall ED population for the same time periods increased.
      Conclusion: The results demonstrate the FEDU population is not a homogeneous group of patients. Increased attention to differences among FEDU groups is necessary in order to plan more effective interventions. West J Emerg Med.

Final Solutions: Biology, Prejudice, and Genocide by Richard M.

Lerner traces genetic explanations for human behaviour from Darwin, through scientists of the Nazi era to contemporary sociobiologists. He finds a continuous thread of ideas and alerts us to the political dangers of the impactof such thinking on social attitudes and policies.

When Finance Leads to Planning: Urban Planning, Highway Planning, and Metropolitan Freeways in California
Freeways have profoundly influenced the form and function of U.S. cities, yet urban planners generally played only a peripheral role in their development. This article traces the history of freeway development in California to show how political negotiations between local and state governments over street and highway finance resulted in urban freeways financed, designed, and built by the state highway department. To fund their ambitious transportation plans, local officials and planners in cities like Los Angeles turned over control of the planning and development of urban freeways in the 1940s and 1950s to state departments of transportation. This shift in control led to, among other things, the construction of freeways too large to fit easily into cities and freeway networks too sparse to adequately disperse urban traffic. While federal surface transportation legislation returned significant control over metropolitan freeways to regions and planners in the 1990s, the influence of modern freeways on urban life endures.

The coverage of mass media on the 2008 and 2009 indigenous mobilizations in Colombia
This thesis explores the portrayal of the Colombian Indigenous mobilizations - or Mingas - in 2008 and 2009 by domestic mass media outlets, specifically news paper and television news reports. This analysis is done in four main parts. First the paper provides a background on the Colombian indigenous movements in the years leading up to these protests. It illustrates some of the challenges and achieves of the Indigenous movement in Colombia, one of the most successful grassroots movements in Colombian history. The second part of this thesis shows three structural problems of mass media that affect the coverage of the Indigenous political process in mass media : the monopolization of mass media, the problems endure by journalists, and the racist and Eurocentric hegemonic ideology embedded in mass media structure. The third part explains the most important events of the 2008 and 2009 Mingas. This part evidences the violence and the unfounded accusation of the government against the Indigenous people, some of the conflicts of the indigenous movement with illegal groups, and some of the internal challenges of the Indigenous movement. The final chapter is the content analysis of the coverage of the 2008 and 2009 Mingas in the most important newspapers and television news in Colombia: El Tiempo, El Espectador, Caracol News, and RCN News

Can using a global perspective help control migration? : Ecuador and Spain's Proyecto Codesarrollo Canñar-Murcia
Current trends in immigration policy suggest that international cooperation policies are becoming increasingly common as a means for nation-states to attain their immigration policy objectives. This thesis aims to analyze the impacts of these policies on the communities and individuals involved by examining the micro-level effects of bilateral agreements and co-development projects between Ecuador and Spain through a study of the communities involved in the Cañar-Murcia Co-development Project (CMCP). The CMCP is a co-government funded pilot model designed to facilitate the economic and social development in the migrants' community of origin and their community of residence. It is comprised of a large number of state and non-state actors - including the migrants themselves - at the national, provincial and local level of both countries. The specific aim of this thesis is to determine the degree to which the CMCP has been implemented, present the obstacles it has faced, and to then analyze its effect on the members of the Cañari populations in both Cañar and Murcia. I then look at the impacts of the project on social networks, transnational activities, migration patterns, and integration. I find that the success of these types of projects depends largely on the existing political, social and cultural situations in both communities, as conflicts can be created or exacerbated with the power and money introduced by these projects

Examining Vicarious Guilt and Shame Through Corporate and Categoric Dimensions of Social Identities
This study examines the group-based emotions of vicarious shame and vicarious guilt using an elaboration of the perceptual control focus of identity theory. The concept of social identity is refined through incorporating categorical and corporate dimensions. This extends identity theory by including new dimensions of meaning, which have not been examined in the existing literature as well as by testing the predictive power of specific emotions as outcomes of the identity verification process. Moreover, the role of culture via interdependent self-construals is also considered within these processes. To empirically test these relationships, two surveys are administered to over three hundred students at a large Southwestern university. The survey contains a series of hypothetical scenarios measuring two social identities: ethnic and classmate. The purpose of the scenarios is to create the conditions in which vicarious shame and guilt are thought to occur in addition to activating the respondent's social identity. After respondents read each scenario, they are queried regarding their social identities, reflected appraisals, extent to which they saw the act as a violation, motivation to change how others perceive them and emotional responses among other things. Results are mixed; showing that while ethnic and classmate identities do not significantly predict shame and guilt, reflected appraisals do across all scenarios. In certain contexts degree of violation, degree of self-reported interdependence, and identity prominence are also shown to be significant predictors. Implications of the study findings and recommendations for future research are discussed.

The validity of partition as a solution to ethnic conflict
This paper examines the effectiveness of partition in ceasing violence during ethnic conflict. Wigmore-Shepherd’s 2012 study argued that ethnic conflict is often due to the congruence between ethnic and political identity, allowing political conflicts to become ‘ethnicised’ and ethnic conflict to eclipse the original political dispute. Therefore this paper hypothesises that ethnic homogenisation via partition can allow the original political conflict to re-emerge in a potentially violent manner. The hypothesis is tested by an agent based model adapted from the model used in the 2012 study. The model finds that in the instances where there is not a perfect congruence between ethnic and political identity, politically motivated violence does persist in the ethnic enclaves.  It was found that a lower level of congruence would result in a higher level of post-partition violence. Furthermore the act of migration itself can encourage spikes of ethnically motivated violence and agents of different ethnicity cross paths to reach their enclave.

Co-evolutionary Dynamics of Culture, Parochial Cooperation, and Networks
Theoretically informed by recent computational and mathematical studies highlighting the importance of signals and networks in the evolution of cooperation, the present research undertakes simulation experiments to investigate socio-psychological bases and structural foundations of cooperation as institutional order. Simulated societies consist of three groups of agents with markers and tolerance: altruists, defectors, and parochial egoists. They simultaneously play a one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma game with neighbors by helping tolerably similar ones and by declining to help otherwise. They either imitate markers and tolerance of more successful neighbors or switch partners by breaking the old ones to out-group neighbors after creating new ties to others if both sides accept each other as in-group.Our study furthers understanding of the dynamics of cooperation in human societies facing the Prisoner's Dilemma: altruists alone are less likely to defeat defectors regardless of network topology as cooperation becomes costly and the average number of interaction partners increases; under these conditions, parochialism is necessary for the institutionalization of cooperation; agents adapt themselves to increasingly homogenized environments by learning intolerance; emergent cooperative societies in the presence of imitation errors are vulnerable to free-riders with tolerably similar markers; either persistent cultural diversity or highly clustered networks with long paths stabilize cooperation; and even if markers are completely mutable, society-wide and robust cooperation is achievable with increased diversity as hierarchical networks of cultural groups self-organize where less tolerant agents in the periphery shield more tolerant ones in the core from emerging free-riders.The current study provides sociologists with theoretical and methodological resources for a game-theoretical approach to institutional analysis. Socio-psychological research maintains that group identity enhances cooperation either because human subjects in pre-assigned groups maximize group-level rewards or when they expect continuing benefits from in-group favoritism. We rather demonstrate the evolution of cooperation without expectations of in-group reciprocity. Cultural groups emerge as arbitrary markers become salient together with stratification driven by parochial interactions. Our study also contributes to understanding of how stable markets can evolve out of repeated plays of a social dilemma game among parochial agents locally embedded in on-going exchange networks with limited knowledge about costs and opportunities.

Immigrants, Immigrant Policy, and Foundation of the Next Century's Latino Politics: The Declining Salience of the Civil Rights Agenda in an Era of High Immigration
The fundamental question that we ask in this paper is whether the public policy needs of immigrant Latinos can be understood as part of the civil rights agenda. Our tentative answer is that they are distinct. If this is the case, we indicate that the policy needs of immigrants will steadily eclipse the civil rights issues that have galvanized Latino elites and, to a lesser extent, Latinos as a whole from the 1960s to the present.

Development of a Data Collection Instrument for Violent Patient Encounters against Healthcare Workers
Introduction: Healthcare and social workers have the highest incidence of workplace violence of any industry. Assaults toward healthcare workers account for nearly half of all nonfatal injuries from occupational violence. Our goal was to develop and evaluate an instrument for prospective collection of data relevant to emergency department (ED) violence against healthcare workers.
      Methods: Participants at a high-volume tertiary care center were shown 11 vignettes portraying verbal and physical assaults and responded to a survey developed by the research team and piloted by ED personnel addressing the type and severity of violence portrayed. Demographic and employment groups were compared using the independent-samples Mann-Whitney U Test.
      Results: There were 193 participants (91 male). We found few statistical differences when comparing occupational and gender groups. Males assigned higher severity scores to acts of verbal violence versus females (mean M,F=3.08, 2.70; p<0.001). While not achieving statistical significance, subgroup analysis revealed that attending physicians rated acts of verbal violence higher than resident physicians, and nurses assigned higher severity scores to acts of sexual, verbal, and physical violence versus their physician counterparts.
      Conclusion: This survey instrument is the first tool shown to be accurate and reliable in characterizing acts of violence in the ED across all demographic and employment groups using filmed vignettes of violent acts. Gender and occupation of ED workers does not appear to play a significant role in perception of severity workplace violence. West J Emerg Med. 2012;13(5):429-433.

The US 19th and 20th Century Experiences: Lessons for the Eurozone Crisis
The evolution of institutions in the US and other unions provides clear lessons. There are large gains from buffering currency unions with a union-wide deposit insurance, and partial debt mutualisation. The credibility of a union deposit insurance scheme requires transparent funding and supervision, with a reliable backstopping mechanism. Establishing the credibility of such a scheme benefits from partial debt mutualisation and the formation of a dedicated union-level tax collection needed to serve these liabilities. Limited debt mutualisation does not preclude the existence of a vibrant independent debt market for the union’s states, restricted by each state’stax revenue.

When You're 64: Publics, Aging and Community in San Francisco
This dissertation investigates the politics of aging in the contemporary United States vis-à-vis welfare work, public spheres and everyday life.  As a quick glance at any recent news headline will reveal, the demographic realities of an aging population has become a pressing concern for policymakers, families and communities throughout the United States.  From documentaries about Alzheimer's disease to debates around pension reform, old age has captured the collective imaginary with uncanny zeal.  A city often identified with its bohemian youth culture, San Francisco is home to the largest urban older adult population in the state of California, approximately 14% of who are over the age of 65.  For many residents, migration to retirement communities is either financially out of reach or socially undesirable, creating a new set of realities whereby seniors opt to "age in place."  Based on a year and a half of ethnographic fieldwork from 2009 to 2010 with a coalition of organizations focusing on queer aging, a group of seniors forming a nascent care network amongst one another as well as interviews with older San Franciscans, I examine the aging publics and lifeworlds coming into being in one American city.  Throughout, I argue that aging offers a lens through which to analyze competing visions of American modernity--one vision focusing on individuality and independence, another stressing the importance of community and connection.

Transpacific Identities in Film and Literature
In her vital 2003 work,<italic> Imagine Otherwise</italic>, Kandace Chuh argues for an intervention in Asian American studies using a transnational analytic.  As globalization increases in the twenty-first century, the continued movement of peoples, capital, and cultures across the Pacific Rim in myriad forms ranging from traditional immigration to new global digital networks demonstrates the importance of continuing the use of a transnational paradigm in Asian American studies.  Moreover, within this specifically transpacific framework, this study specifically focuses on the role of visual culture, in the form of the global circulation of film and film images.  As Stuart Hall and Paul Gilroy have argued for African American cultural identity, it is within this global circuit of film that minority communities and individuals have constructed their myriad cultural identities.  Thus, this study considers the ways in which Asian American minority subjects interact within this transpacific network of global circulation of film.  In other words, this project sits squarely at this intersection of these three theoretical strands:  the transpacific, the role of visual culture, and the creation of an Asian American identity.    Specifically, this study explores the various ways in which different works film and literature articulate both the realities and possibilities of new transpacific identities constructed within this web of global economic, political, and cultural exchanges.  Moreover, in thinking about the role of movies and film is to also think about the distance between the spectacular nature of filmic imagery and the everyday lived reality of minority subjects.  Furthermore, filmic imagery, especially the Hollywood film product that is the subject of this study, is often highly ideological, offering imagery and representations that both reflect and establish white hegemonic power and control.  To this end, the novels of Jessica Hagedorn, <italic>Dogeaters</italic>, <italic>The Gangster of Love</italic>, and <italic>Dream Jungle</italic> serve to establish a paradigm for the relationship between film and its spectacular nature and the individual living in her quotidian reality.  Thus, the different works in this study offer different ways in which individual identities are created both because of, and often in spite of, the spectacular constructions of Asians and Asian Americans.

Companionship and Altruism in Daily Activity Time Allocation and Travel by Men and Women in the Same Households
In this paper, using data from 366 households we study human interaction within and outside the household. In the analysis altruism and companionship between men and women are explored using path analysis to identify gender-roles and mutual influences. Men and women have very different templates of time allocation characterized by lack of symmetry in relationships between men and women. Although women's time allocation has some influence on men's time allocation, it may function as a constraint only when women engage in activities for a considerable amount of time in a day. In contrast, men's influence is significant and substantial at any level of time allocation. Regarding the relationship between altruism and companionship, men appear to be "rationing" their time and allocate time either to relatives or to others. Women appear to be more fully engaged with relatives and with others (presumably functioning as the social network hubs of the household). Finally, travel is not emerging as a cause but as an outcome supporting once again the practice in activity-based models of considering travel demand as derived from the need to participate in activities. It should also be noted that travel is a very small fraction of the total daily time allocation and does not function as a constraint in budgeting time for activities with and for relatives and other persons. A clear hierarchy also emerges from the path model developed here with blocks of variables determining other blocks of variables in a sequence.

Examining life's origins : history and epistemic principles in the search for the origins of life
My dissertation provides a novel philosophical and historical analysis of origins of life research, a scientific field that poses significant conceptual challenges to evolutionary theory, standard experimental methodology, and theory integration across disciplines. The origin of life is sometimes considered "the most fundamental problem in biology." Despite its theoretical significance, the field of study is fraught with fundamental disagreements over theories, methods and approaches. The origin of life presents a boundary problem for central biological processes, including natural selection, which presupposes the existence of an enormously complex physical system of replication that must have been absent in the emergence of life. Without natural selection, other forces must have driven the origin of life, and I illustrate which alternative explanations are may be involved in explaining life's origin. Such explanations have sometimes been associated with critical receptions of standard neo-Darwinian theory, so far from being independent of evolutionary principles, they have been connected with evolutionary theory in complex ways. I further investigate the heuristics used to evaluate the new discoveries in the origin of life. One of the most important such heuristics is continuity : an insistence that transformations in the path to life display no saltatory transitions. I use case studies to show how the principle of continuity is not used consistently across research groups in origin of life research, and how its invocation depends on background assumptions about the likelihood of success of alternative research programs. I conclude that the principle of continuity has been, in practice, either unhelpful or even positively harmful to research into life's origins. The topic of the origin of life underwent a remarkable transformation in the 20th century, from a question disparaged as speculative metaphysics to a legitimate field of scientific inquiry. Central to this transition was the British polymath J.B.S. Haldane. Haldane brought the question of life's origin into mainstream scientific investigation with his 1929 hypothesis of life's emergence from the "hot dilute soup" of Earth's early environment. This theory arose in the context of a protracted debate on holism and mechanism. I show how that philosophical debate figured in Haldane's philosophy and science, and what intellectual and social forces were acting on Haldane's novel chemical-evolutionary proposal for life's genesis

Race, Ethnic, and Nativity Differences in Intergenerational Relationships
International migration over the past half century has increased the racial and ethnic diversity of countries in North America and Western Europe. My dissertation highlights two ways in which intergenerational relationships can be studied in light of increasing population heterogeneity. One approach is to assess whether immigrants and their descendants adopt "mainstream" attitudes, norms and behaviors related to parent-child relationships over time.  A second approach is to explore ways in which increasing population diversity changes the influence that parents and offspring have over one another and the ways in which they interact.   In my first chapter, I adopt the first approach and ask how social contexts influence immigrants' attitudes towards family obligation and in particular, the difference between attitudes of immigrants and the native born towards family support. This chapter examines nativity differences in intergenerational obligation across two social contexts: Germany and the Netherlands. Intergenerational obligation is defined as the extent to which parents and children feel a sense of duty to assist one another and to take into account the needs and wishes of each other when making decisions. The paper focuses on first- and second-generation Turkish immigrants only and compares them to their native counterparts in Germany and the Netherlands.  By comparing immigrants and their descendents from the same sending country to the "native" population of two countries, a main obstacle that commonly hinders cross-national migration research - comparing immigrants from different countries across contexts - is addressed.  I use data from the Generations and Gender Survey and apply structural equation models in the main analysis. After demonstrating consistency in the measurement and meaning of intergenerational obligation across groups, I find that immigrants have stronger family ties than natives in both countries. However, the nativity gap is much smaller in Germany compared to the Netherlands. In addition, the overall level of family obligation is lower among Turkish immigrants in the Netherlands compared to their counterparts Germany. I explain these differences from a policy perspective: More generous social welfare supports for families as well as multicultural policies that help immigrants retain their cultural identity in the Netherlands, compared to Germany, shed light on these findings. Importantly, the results suggest that attitudes towards family obligation are not fixed upon arrival; rather, they vary depending on the contexts into which immigrants settle. The findings speak to previous research that often describe differences between immigrants and natives as if immigrants' characteristics are fixed, ignoring the role that the receiving country context plays in altering immigrants' behaviors and attitudes.My second chapter asks how increasing population diversity affects the type of partner individuals choose to marry and whether parent-child relationships influence these decisions. I apply a linked lives approach by exploring the connection between parent-child ties and when and whom offspring marry. Parental resources and parent-child relationships are well-known factors influencing children's family formation behaviors. Parents shape when offspring marry, whether they cohabit before marriage, when they have children and the number of children they have. However, far less is known about how parent-child relationships affect who children marry. Growing population diversity and changing patterns of race/ethnic segregation provide individuals with more opportunities to meet partners of a different race/ethnic background than their own. Although recent research asserts that parental influence on children's marital behaviors is waning, parents may still influence who children choose to marry.   In this chapter, I use data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to investigate how parent-child relationships during adolescence affect the timing and type of marriage young adults choose. I ask whether strong parent-child relationships are more likely to lead to marriage, rather than remaining single and whether they are positively associated with entry into a same-race, rather than cross-race exogamous unions. Finally, I ask whether the association between parent-child ties and offspring's union formation vary across race/ethnic and nativity groups. The results from this chapter suggest that individuals with closer ties to the family of origin start families of their own at younger ages. Yet the effect of parent-child relationships on offspring's marital timing is moderated somewhat by the respondent's background. In addition to influencing when children marry, strong emotional support across generations tends to increase the probability of entering into a same-race union, rather than a racially exogamous union. The third and final chapter of my dissertation examines how marriage and intermarriage in particular affects young adults' ties to parents. Family scholars today argue that modern marriage privileges self-fulfillment and a reliance on partners to fulfill emotional and social needs that did not characterize marriage among earlier generations. An emphasis on couple quality and the time and resources needed to maintain such partnerships may have negative consequences for ties to parents. I use data from the most recent wave of National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and ask how marriage, and exogamous versus endogamous marriage in particular, are associated with ties to mothers. I also ask whether the association between offspring's union type and intergenerational ties are stronger for some groups compared to others, and whether the specific race of the partner matters. Findings from this chapter suggest that married children are not completely detached from mothers; rather, they occupy a middle ground. Married children tend to live nearby, but not close to mothers and tend to visit weekly, but not daily compared to those who are single. Who offspring marry also affects relationships with mothers. Children who married across race/ethnic lines are less likely to live near mothers compared to those who married within race/ethnic lines. Because of the geographic distance, these individuals are also less likely to visit or talk to mothers frequently compared to those who married within race/ethnic boundaries. However, the consequences of intermarriage are particularly detrimental for some groups compared to others. Hispanics, Asians and children of immigrants tended to have worse relationships with mothers following intermarriage compared to Whites and children of U.S. natives. These results highlight how intermarriage - a commonly understood mechanism that at the population level decreases the distance between groups - may in fact detrimentally affect ties among family members involved.

Implicit Formality:  Keesing’s Challenge and Its  Significance for European Kinship
During the 1960s and 1970s, students of kinship became increasingly uneasy about the gap between formal terminology-and-genealogy-based models and data on actual behaviour. This gap–sometimes described as the problem of relating ‘prescriptive’ and ‘statistical’ models–was an important factor in Schneider’s rejection of the structural and cognitive traditions, and their subsequent near abandonment by Anglo-American anthropology. However, these developments did not resolve the problem so much as simply refuse to address it. The need for a better understanding of the relation between terminology and behaviour is still there, nowhere more so than in Europe, where quantitative historians and sociologists have revealed major macro-regional differences in kinship practices, which are associated with distinct patterns of kinship terminology. 
        
      This is where Keesing comes in. In his contribution to a 1972 volume celebrating the centenary of Morgan’s “Systems”, he, too criticized the existing work on formal models–but did not advocate abandoning it. On the contrary, he argued that it should be extended and deepened–setting aside simplistic assumptions of a direct correspondence between terms and roles in order to model the complex social and semantic processes that integrate kinship with the rest of social life. In this article, I return to Keesing’s agenda and propose a modeling approach that would fit some of the European data.

Presentation of social identity and language use among bilingual Korean English speakers
The aim of this research study was to better understand how bilingual Korean English speakers use language in face -to-face interaction as well as in online social networks relates to their social identities. The study was grounded in social theory of language and social identity theory. The social theory of language views language as a form of social practice and suggests that language is meaningful within social contexts. Social identity theory defines social identity as an individual's self-definition or perception in relation to other associates in the social group to which one belongs. The existing research on language use among bilingual Korean English speakers and a review of literature regarding online social networks and Korean immigrants' online literacy practice also served as a larger context for this study. The research was conducted using a mixed-method approach. An online questionnaire collected demographic data as well as information about the bilingual Korean English speakers' self-assessed language proficiencies, language uses, and their social identities. The survey participants included 78 bilingual Korean English speakers in southern California. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted to gather in-depth explanation from the bilingual participants in terms of their use of languages and their presentation of social identities. Among the 78 survey participants, 16 were chosen to participant in the interviews. There were six major findings about bilingual Korean English speakers. First, bilingual Korean English speakers with different levels of self-assessed language proficiency use the languages differently based on their conversational partners or the social contexts of the conversation. Secondly, their self-assessed language proficiency does not relate to their social identity construction. Third, they select a specific language based on the language skills of their conversational partners. Fourth, they intentionally use Korean when talking about topics specifically related to Korean life or addressing others in ways that reflect cultural norms. Fifth, their social identities are shaped by the shared idea about typical Korean-American. Lastly, they use both Korean and English differently online depending on their social identities. These findings have implications both for research on language use and identity formation and for language teaching and learning

The Recuperation of Historic Memory: Recognizing Suppressed Female Voices From the Spanish Civil War and Francoist Repression
During the Spanish civil war and ensuing epoch ofrepression, female voices were suppressed and as a result,stripped of agency. Francoist historiographers legitimizedthis discrimination by excluding female perspectives of thepast. Grounded in the sociology of memory and the theoryof trauma, this dissertation investigates various plays,films and novels that attempt to revise Spain's officialhistory by engaging the past through the memory of others.In chapter one, this dissertation examines earlier attemptsto fracture patriarchal thought in the play Las arrecogíasdel beaterio de Santa María Egipcíaca (1970) by José MartínRecuerda and the film Cría cuervos (1975) written anddirected by Carlos Saura. Chapters two through fourinvestigate more contemporary works. These are the novelLa voz dormida (2002) by Dulce Chacón, the documentaryMuerte en El Valle (2005) by C.M. Hardt, Josefina Aldecoa'strilogy Historia de una maestra (1990), Mujeres de negro(1994), and La fuerza del destino (1997), Lidia Falcón's1994 play Las mujeres caminaron con el fuego del siglo andfinally Guillermo Del Toro's 2006 film El laberinto delfauno. I argue that these works exemplify intent tosplinter Spanish cultural hegemony and accord historicalvoice to women by undermining the oppressive social,political and cultural ideologies that bind female agency.Consequently, these works produce a new space for women tooccupy while at the same time create revolutionary femalemodels.

The Spatial Segregation of Ethnic and Demographic Groups: Comparative Evidence from Stockholm and San Francisco
This paper compares the level of spatial segregation by race or ethnicity with the level of spatial segregation by demographic group in two metropolitan areas with similar incomes and demographic compositions, but with very different racial proportions. We compare census tract data for the San Francisco Bay Area for 1980, a region with six large ethnic divisions, with similar data for the Stockholm metropolitan area, a region with a much more homogeneous racial composition.
      An extensive comparison of entropy measures of segregation in the two regions is presented, including for Stockholm, an analysis of spatial segregation by income class. One important finding of the analysis, replicated in two very different metropolitan regions, is that spatial segregation by race or ethnicity is unrelated to the principal economic factors which presumable underly spatial segregation by income clss or demographic grouping.

“Si Nicaragua Venció”: Lesbian and Gay Solidarity with the Revolution
This article analyzes the radical imagination of lesbian and gay activism in solidarity with the Nicaraguan Revolution. It examines the reasons US lesbian and gay radicals supported that revolution and investigates the ways that homoerotic, especially lesbian, desire shaped their solidarity. Drawing on Herbert Marcuse and Michel Foucault, the article argues that lesbian and gay radicals viewed the Nicaraguan Revolution in erotic and heterotopic terms. Posters, fliers, and interviews reveal that US activists, people of color and white, represented the Revolution and solidarity through tropes of female masculinity and women’s affection. Many Nicaraguan lesbians and gay men shared these nonnormative images of socialist change. Yet while Nicaraguans claimed Sandinismo as their own, for US activists revolution remained a distant object of desire and solidarity a “seduction,” “crush,” or embrace.  United States activists who embraced developmentalist views of Latin American sexualities remained unable to witness lesbian and gay life inside Nicaragua, while lesbian and gay Sandinistas kept silent about FSLN homophobia so as not to undermine solidarity against the Contra war. Desire served as a powerful tool for mobilizing transnational solidarity. By failing to examine desire critically, however, US activists limited their communications with Nicaraguan lesbians and gay men and weakened the relationship they sought with revolution itself.

In faith or fear : fighting with Lozada
Through analysis of local politics, agrarian reform, and popular movements in nineteenth-century Jalisco, this project pursues an understanding of nation building in Mexico and the rural challenges to both liberal and conservative notions of that process. My investigation broadens our understanding of indigenous and peasant cultures by exploring regional conceptualizations of community between 1857 and 1876 and by questioning the liberal values with which they are sometimes associated. Although it is unlikely that villagers were either conservative or liberal in a national political sense of the term, I demonstrate that Lozada's movement was rooted in rural, popular conservatism. This study takes one of the largest rural rebellions of the period, led primarily by a conservative mestizo, Manuel Lozada, as its central subject. For a brief period in 1873, Lozada mobilized nearly 7,000 rural followers in an attempt to overthrow the national government. As one of approximately twenty regional rebellions over the same historical period, his particular uprising also represents a broader sense of rural discontent with the Mexican state. My project explores both the theoretical and practical implications of popular conservatism juxtaposed with local and national politics. The first three substantive chapters scrutinize Lozada's career as a leader, peasant participation in rebellion, and the nature of property disputes in the region. Such an emphasis illustrates motives for peasant rebellion and other forms of engagement with the state in order to meet local needs. These findings also illustrate the ways in which collective violence did not coincide with the liberal ideals of modern revolutions. The final three chapters analyze the political and economic changes in the seventh canton of Jalisco, the area that would become the State of Nayarit in 1917. I examine the evolution of local and national bureaucracies, the role of contraband in economic and political life, and representations of local rebels in media over time. In sum, these chapters illuminate the challenges that became evident as a state with limited coercive capacity extended its modernizing influence into regions that had previously exercised significant political and economic autonomy

[group, civilian, violent, attack, supporter, political]

In the crosshairs : explaining violence against civilians
My dissertation investigates the factors that explain when groups are most or least likely to target civilians. While civilians are a particularly appealing target because they are easy to attack, many groups go to great lengths to avoid them. Thus, the question motivating my research is: given the potential windfalls implicit in civilian attacks, why do some organizations target them while others do not?. In this project, I take a two-step approach to answering this question. I begin by looking at what targets groups are likely to attack given the government from which they wish to gain political concessions. Based on a coercive model of violence, I argue groups attack those segments of society that apply the most pressure on a government. In general terms, the most influential segments of society for any government are its minimum winning coalition and selectorate. After surveying the literature on a large number of different regime types, I conclude that civilians face the highest risk of being attacked in democracies because, unlike forms of non- democracy, the minimum winning coalition and selectorate in democracies are composed of civilians. The second step, and the bulk of this project, examines civilian targeting within democratic contexts. To address variation within democracies, I argue that violent groups are most likely to attack civilians when doing so does not hurt their supporters or undermine the support they receive from the larger population. Although attacks on civilians are easy to execute and democratic political institutions encourage such attacks, these attacks impose high costs (often in the form of government repression) on the segment of the civilian population that supports the violent group. In addition, attacks on civilian supporters may alienate some of the group's supporters who will not back a group that targets innocent civilians. Losing civilian supporters is problematic for violent organizations that draw heavily from community-level alliances for operational success and political leverage. My theory identifies and explores three unique conditions that make groups more or less likely to attack civilians within democracies. First, when a violent group runs for political office, a community can punish the group. Consequently, groups with political wings temper their violence by attacking civilians less often. Secondly, when a terrorist group provides goods and services throughout neighborhoods for its supporters, it offsets the costs associated with violence on civilian targets. Compared to groups that don't distribute resources, provider groups are more likely to target civilians because the consequences are not as dire. Finally, when a terrorist group draws support from a highly segmented part of the population, it is easier for the group's enemies (usually government authorities, but a group's enemies may also include other violent groups) to repress and intimidate the group's supporters. When this occurs, groups are less likely to attack civilians because their support base suffers more costs from reprisals. Each condition emphasizes the same innovative contribution: civilians matter, and not just as collateral damage. They matter because violent groups rely on them and, as a result, they affect the type of violence groups pursue. I test my theory using large-N statistical analyses and detailed case research. My empirical work presents new data on terrorist groups, including their political (non- violent) and redistributive activities. Using this data, I test my claims using a cross-national dataset of attacks over the last forty years. My case research focuses on the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) in Northern Ireland. The case of the IRA demonstrates how involvement in politics decreases the odds a group will attack civilians

Spirits in a material world : representations of gentrification in U.S. urban centers
This dissertation proposes that literary texts can capture and reflect how representational spaces are conjured up by authors to inscribe a hidden past. This hidden past is often subsumed from the official narratives approved by redevelopment agencies and the state. This dissertation also argues that it is imperative to see these inscriptions of the past as haunting reminders demanding that we remember the people and spaces removed from gentrified neighborhoods. These specters of history leave us ill at ease, wondering what can and should be done in the future to address the inequities of dislocation and relocation that result from gentrification. These specters permit a recuperation of "subjugated knowledge" where the violence of the past permits itself to be seen through the inscription of a historical past to neighborhoods facing gentrification. They inscribe a past so as to develop an oppositional narrative that defers resistance into the future so as to change the desire of residents. That is, the texts examined here ask longtime residents to challenge future encroachments of gentrification while asking newer residents to understand the subjugated histories of the neighborhood and to understand that their existence within a neighborhood carries real, and sometimes, unintended consequences into a neighborhood. For these reasons, this dissertation examines texts from New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles in order to excavate these histories. The dissertation thus offers examples of how to face and challenge gentrification in the United States

Immigrant Unionization through the Great Recession
Previous research finds that in recent years immigrants had a higher propensity to unionize than native-born workers. However, there is little research that shows historically marginalized immigrant workers are able to maintain newly acquired union jobs, especially during times unfavorable to unionization more generally. Therefore, this paper focuses on immigrant unionization during the Great Recession of 2008 to determine whether the inroads that immigrants have made through organizing are maintained in hostile union environments. Using the Current Population Survey (CPS), I extend Rosenfeld and Kleykamp’s (2009) models for Hispanic unionization (which end in 2007) through the recent downturn and beyond. I find that Hispanic immigrants, who hold higher odds of union entry or membership in Rosenfeld and Kleykamp’s prerecession analysis, lost union jobs at an increased rate during the Great Recession compared with white native-born workers. These effects for Hispanic immigrants filter throughout various subcategories and control variables that include years since entry, citizenship status, and nationality. These results are likely not the result of unfavorable labor market allocation of immigrants, and to some degree undercut the hopes of those who view immigrants as the key to organized labor’s future and organized labor as the key to immigrant prosperity.

Tracking Oppositional Identity among United States Youth
The source of the racial achievement gap in this country continues to elude researchers. One popular explanation for divergent educational outcomes between racial/ethnic groups is John Ogbu's oppositional culture thesis that differences in academic outcomes can be traced to differences in academic orientations (attitudes and behaviors). Using the National Educational Longitudinal Survey of 1988 (NELS), this dissertation addresses various substantive and methodological questions within the oppositional culture framework through studying Mexican American, African American, Asian American, and White youth.Chapter 2 examines a number of measurement issues regarding oppositional identity. One of these issues is the consistency of teacher versus student-reported oppositional identity. I find that when examining the same behaviors, there are differences in what teachers and students report. Thus, I argue that teacher and student reports of oppositional identity should not be used interchangeably. A second issue concerns the number of sub-dimensions that make up oppositional identity. I employ factor analysis to validate my oppositional identity construct. I find that oppositional identity can have as many as five sub-dimensions, but they all fall under a global construct of oppositional identity. A third issue is the stability of oppositional identity over time. I conduct longitudinal invariance analyses and find that oppositional identity is not stable, but rather exhibits change over time. Thus, I argue that research must take into account who is doing the reporting, what dimension of oppositional identity is being examined, and when oppositional identity is studied.Researchers have studied differences in oppositional identity by race/ethnicity. One omission in such analyses is the role of ability grouping (tracking) within the school system. A second omission is the role of family factors in the adoption of oppositional identity.  Chapter 3 seeks to fill these gaps by introducing track placement, family background, and parental involvement as predictors of oppositional identity. I find that the effect of these covariates depends on who is reporting, the survey wave being studied, and the dimension of oppositional identity of interest. I also find that racial/ethnic differences are reduced when these covariates are added, while gender differences are consistent and robust. Thus, I argue that oppositional identity is more of a gendered than racial phenomenon.Chapter 4 examines the effects of oppositional identity on both achievement and dropping out of school. I find that oppositional identity is a significant predictor of both reading and mathematics achievement. I also find that oppositional identity is a significant predictor of dropping out, yet is not able to account for the racial/ethnic gap in these educational outcomes.I conclude my dissertation with a discussion of my findings and the limitations of my analyses. I also discuss areas for future research on oppositional identity.

Urban Spatial Structure
An interview with Chicago's current mayor, Richard M. Daley:
      'New York is too big this way,' the mayor says, raising a thick hand over his head. Stretching both arms out at his sides, he adds, 'Los Angeles is too big this way.  All the other cities are too small.  We're just right.'  (Bailey and Coleman, 1996, p. 6)
      Mayor Daley is catering to a widespread fascination with the roles that urban size and structure play in people's lives.  Academic as well as other observers have long sought explanations for urban development patterns and criteria by which to judge their desirability.  Furthermore, as we shall see, understanding the organization of cities yields insights about economy-wide growth processes and sheds light on economic concepts of long standing interest:  returns to scale, monopolistic competition, vertical integration, technological innovation, innovation diffusion, and international specialization.  Cities also are prime illustrations of some newer academic interests such as complex structural evolution and self-organization.

Testimonio transformed : from I, Rigoberta to Guatemala, Nunca más and Guatemala, Memoria del silencio
In a country like Guatemala, with a long history of contentious politics and internecine violence, the telling of history often becomes a debate over "truth" and the "authority" to tell it. For the people most affected by the violence of war, garnering international humanitarian attention is vital and the way in which it was done in this country proved to be polemical. In the 1980s, testimony became a tool of resistance against violence and oppression. Testimony as a tool transformed in the postwar period. It became both a method of collective healing and social justice, as well as an alternative way of constructing a history of violence. This thesis explores testimonio's transformation through a comparative analysis of three important texts : Rigoberta Menchú's testimonio and two truth commission reports known as the CEH report and the REMHI project. All three texts show the socio- historical importance of inscribing subjective and affective versions of "historical truth" into narratives of Guatemala's violent past

Affilation as an Intervening Variable:  Covariation in Measures of Affiliation in a Reproductive and a Nonreporductive Group of Rhesus Macaques (Macaca mulatta)
Affiliation is often used as an intervening variable in behavioral studies of nonhuman primates. Variables used to measure affiliation should be strongly correlated if it is a valid intervening variable. Social context also should not strongly influence relationships between variables used to measure affiliation. Few studies have, however, reported either the correlations between variables used to assess affiliation or the influence of social context on relationships between the variables. Correlations between affiliative variables were therefore calculated on data from two groups of rhesus {Macaca mulatta)and influences of social context on these correlations were assessed. Affiliation was measured with 7 variables. Two methods were used to investigate the influence of social context: Analyses were made of interactions between several age/sex categories of individuals. Comparisons were made between an experimental group and a matched control group. There were higher rates of sexual behavior in the experimental group. The mature males in the experimental group were vasectomized so females did not conceive. In this group females had repeated nonpregnant estrous cycles. Males were intact in the control group. In this group the mature females conceived and were pregnant during data collection. The variables were significantly correlated across all social contexts. Affiliation may therefore be a useful intervening variable. The magnitude of the correlations between variables did vary considerably across social contexts. Sometimes the sign of the correlations between measures changed as a function of social context. Analyses of individual variables and their interrelationships may therefore be necessary for detailed understanding of the meaning of affiliative interactions in nonhuman primates.

Entangled Roots: Race, Historical Literature, and Citizenship in the Nineteenth-Century Americas
AbstractThomas GenovaEntangled Roots: Race, Historical Literature, and Citizenship in the Nineteenth-Century AmericasThis dissertation examines in the transnational conversation on the place of Afro-descendants in the republican nation-state that ocurred in New-World historical literature during the nineteenth century. Tracing the evolution of republican thought in the Americas from the classical liberalism of the independence period to the more democratic forms of government that took hold in the late 1800s, the pages that follow will chart the circulation of ideas regarding race and republican citizenship in the Atlantic World during the long nineteenth century, the changes that those ideas undergo as they circulate, and the racialized tensions that surface as they move between and among Europe and various locations throughout the Americas. Focusing on a diverse group of writers --including the anonymous Cuban author of Jicoténcal; the North Americans Thomas Jefferson, James Fenimore Cooper, and Mary Mann; the Argentines Domingo Faustino Sarmiento and Eduarda Mansilla de García; the Dominican Manuel de Jesús Galván; the Haitian Émile Nau; and the Brazilian Euclides da Cunha--, I argue that --in the extended Caribbean, the Southern Cone, and the North American empire--, letrado members of the lettered elite were entangled in a hemispheric dialogue on the place of Afro-descendants in the body politic as they looked abroad to countries in similar post-independence situations for models of how to adopt republican forms to racialized New-World society.  In dialogue with one another, letrados from across the Hemisphere turn towards the region's shared history of conquest, colonization and inter-ethnic conflict in order to elaborate a political philosophy to meet the particular structural needs of the Americas. Looking into the past from the vantage of the present, nineteent-century letrados collectively attempted to imagine a future community in which creole hegemony would be preserved.

The politics of representing the past in Bolivia
This dissertation focuses on the role of representations of the past in social differentiation in Bolivia. I examine how connotations of specific representations of the past form important catalysts for organization and mobilization by political parties and social movements throughout the country. Assertions of a direct lineage to various precolonial, colonial, and post-independent peoples have played a vital role in contemporary ideas of difference between the highlands and lowlands of the country. These conceptions of ancestry are used both by political parties and social movements to construct oppositional lines of descent, and perceived differences inherited from ancestors legitimize contemporary ideas about regional variation in Bolivia. This research outlines how these divides are the discursive means through which material claims are debated. Felt historical differences are directly connected to debates over revenue from oil and gas reserves, agrarian reform, and the influence of locally and regionally elected officials in national decisions. As a result, at stake is the distribution of wealth as well as the systems of land ownership and political representation in the country. This research contributes to the anthropology of memory in three ways. First, by framing memory as a representation of the past, I demonstrate how these representations connect individuals temporally to a common ancestral heritage as well as spatially to a place. In this capacity, I argue that memory is a bridge connecting people to each other and to particular shared spaces. Second, in exploring the current role of descent in social distinctions, I show how an individual's perceived ancestry associates ancestral identification with a shared lineage, outlining a key overlap between autobiographical and collective memory. Finally, I demonstrate how power is exercised in the ability to control the connotation of important representations of the past through investigating how these representations are catalysts for organization and mobilization by political parties and social movements. In this capacity, I show that representations of the past reflect, but are also used to construct, meaningful social distinctions and differentiation in the present

Effects of Physical Environement and Social Experience on Stimulus Seeking Behaviour and Emotionality in Rats (Rattus norvegius)
Theinfluences of the physical and social aspects of the environment on temperament in rats are reported in two experiments. In Experiment One changes in animal behavior due to social isolation and enrichment of the physical environment were studied in rats subjected to experimental conditions when they were 25-30 days old. Enrichment of the physical environment led to decreased need for light stimulation and increased exploratory behavior. Social isolation led to an increase in emotional reactivity. Experiment Twowas analogous to Experiment One, diff"ering only in that 60-70 day-old animals were given the experimental conditions. In this case enriched physical environment and social isolation led to decreased exploratory behavior. Need for light stimulation was aff'ected by the interaction of experimental variables. Need for kinesthetic and tactile stimulation were affected by the social environment. Enrichment of the physical environment also led to a decrease in emotional reactivity in the rats. Our experiments indicate that environmental efl'ects were age-contingent. It is proposed that there is probably a relationship between categories of environment and temperament. Further, our findings draw attention to the possibility of a related evolution of sensory systems and temperamental traits.

The Decadent City: Urban Space in Latin American Dirty Realist Fiction
This dissertation explores the treatment of urban spaces in Latin American dirty realist fiction from the 1990's to the present, focusing on the works of Guillermo Fadanelli (Mexico), Fernando Vallejo (Colombia), and Pedro Juan Gutiérrez (Cuba).   Whereas Fadanelli centers his works in the megalopolis of a Mexico City straining under the pressures of rapid modernization and development, Gutiérrez depicts a Havana crumbling during the economic crises of the Special Period, and Vallejo portrays Medellín as utterly degraded by drug trafficking and its associated violence.  All three authors, however, employ the gritty, almost visceral dirty realist style to best depict poverty-stricken societies populated by unexceptional individuals in a quest for survival in a rapidly transforming and decaying urban landscape.  This dirty realist space is thus primarily defined by abjection and the uncomfortable coexistence of a focus on distinctive local minutia and the homogenizing effects of global, postmodern consumer society, a phenomenon accompanied by the proliferation of non-places as defined by Marc Augé.  In these non-places, the meta-narratives of family, religion and nation that previously marked spaces of identity formation no longer function, leaving a sense of purposelessness.  While there exists some nostalgia for the spaces that produced and reproduced these previous narratives, these spaces also prove to be marginalizing and have contributed to the city's current state of violence and decay.  In light of the negative meanings ascribed to earlier spaces of individual and community identity formation, the evacuation of all meaning from these spaces has a positive connotation.  Even though the manner in which these dirty realist authors are conceptualizing the urban space shows this new space to be decadent, empty, and violent, its transitional nature and the questioning of previous narratives that it implies open room for the creation of a new type of space that could grow to be more inclusive, even if this is never accomplished within the narratives themselves.

Representation, competition, and institutional development in American local government
Conventional accounts of local politics downplay the importance of constituent preferences in explaining democratic outcomes. Instead, they emphasize the overweening influence of elite interest groups, constraints imposed from above by higher levels of government, and the threat of jurisdictional competition as main policy drivers. Using analytical and methodological tools commonly applied in other subfields of political science, I challenge the standard account of urban exceptionalism. In the first empirical chapter, I adopt a statistical method known as multilevel modeling and post-stratification (MRP) to, for the first time, develop comparable measures of public opinion at the local level. I validate the method by showing that it can correctly recover known population parameters by accurately predicting local election outcomes, and demonstrate that MRP improves on other existing tools for measuring policy-specific local opinion. In Chapter 3, I combine MRP with a new dataset on food stamp enrollment in American counties. Using administrative program data, I document substantial variation in the degree of participation across counties, despite the existence of universal eligibility criteria. I then show that mass preferences for redistribution at the local level can account for a substantial amount of this variation. Chapter 4 assesses the extent to which competition between government agencies influences local policy, and who stands to benefit when local governments compete with one another. The chapter analyzes variation in compensation of public employees, testing recent claims that interjurisdictional competition drives up the wages and benefits of specialized public employees. While I find that this is indeed true for certain classes of employees, I show that the effects are modest in size and vary across occupational groups. The concluding chapter examines institutional development among American counties. My analysis challenges Banfield and Wilson's (1963) good- government account of Progressive reforms at the local level. Instead, I argue that reformers were motivated neither by public-regarding values nor desire for more efficient administration but rather by self-interest. Using new data on local economic inequality at the end of the 20th century, I show that wealthy interests pursued reform to insulate government from popular control and to prevent economic redistribution

Chamorros, ghosts, non-voting delegates : GUAM! where the production of America's sovereignty begins
When asked about decolonization and the rights to self- determination of the peoples of the Micronesian islands, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger infamously stated, "There are only 90,000 people there; who gives a dam?." It is in this sort of similar dismissive logic that colonialism today in place such as the island of Guam is regarded. As a colony in a world which has already gotten over colonialism, a place such as Guam is a sad exception to the existing multicultural family of nations. In this sense, Guam and places like it are insignificant, and say or mean very little in terms of describing or defining the global order today. They exist to simply be attached to other larger nations, and are defined primarily through powerlessness and dependency. In this dissertation, these relationships and the way they are dominantly articulated today will be challenged and denaturalized. The notions that Guam is an irrelevant effect of the United States, merely a mistake on sovereignty's journey, or a powerless American territory, will be interrogated to reveal their structure. The core of accomplishing this challenge, which amounts to a process of theoretical decolonization, is to re-imagine and re-articulate the meaning of Guam's ambiguous, exceptional status, from one of irrelevance or powerlessness, and reveal the way in which Guam or other sites like it, actually play constitutive roles in producing the powers that claim them. Therefore this dissertation will seek to decolonization the space between Guam and the United States, and Guam and the concept of sovereignty by showing the structure by which Guam potentially sits at the center of American power, and that there are a litany of ways in which its banality, its geography, its coloniality all intersect to constitute the United States, its power, its authority, its might, its sovereignty. Each chapter will represent a different attempt to re-signify that discursive space between Guam and the United States and sovereignty, and to reverse the conventional way in which the space is assumed meaning, and what the tendencies for power and dependency are, or who constitutes who and who is powerful or powerless?

Complexity Theory and Tourism Policy Research
<p>This paper investigates debates about complexity theory and its applications in the social sphere and considers its potential contribution to enhance understanding of tourism policy making.  It identifies five concepts and outlines how they might be employed to enable researchers explore  the complex social circumstances and human interactions that influence policy.   It considers the philosophical implications of social applications of complexity suggesting a move away from concerns about linear process, universal modelling and tangible outputs of policy (such as a plan) and  towards localised and deeper studies to explore the dynamics of the enactment of policy within its context. It suggests that complexity theory might be used as a thinking tool to enable a more holistic approach to policy analysis which can investigate policy in its context, the interactions that exist between different policies and programmes, and the implications of human agency.</p>

Advancement of Separation and Characterization Techniques for Ionic Analytes
The goal of this dissertation is to develop improved analytical methods for the separation and characterization of ionic analytes while gaining insights into their underlying mechanism. The work focused reversed-phase ion-pair high-performance liquid chromatography (RPIP-HPLC) and capillary isotachophoresis (cITP) separations of the highly charged molecules, heparin and heparan sulfate. Furthermore, this work will explore methods to improve the sensitivity of NMR, with a focus on both microcoil and microslot NMR probes.RPIP-HPLC is an important method for the separation of ionic solutes using lipophilic ions, referred to as ion-pairing reagents (IPR), as mobile phase modifiers to aid in their retention on a hydrophobic stationary phase. However, the fine details of the RPIP separation mechanism are still being debated. The described work investigates the role that competition between ion-pairing reagents plays in the separation of structural isomers of heparin and heparan sulfate (HS) disaccharides, and how factors such as IPR concentration and buffer pH affect the resolution of their anomeric forms.NMR spectroscopy can yield a vast amount of structural information about a compound without destroying the sample. However, NMR is often limited by poor sensitivity and for samples containing more than one compound of interest, the spectraviiiobtained can quickly become convoluted, complicating interpretation. To solve these problems we use the pre-concentration/separation method cITP coupled with microcoil NMR detection. The first part of this work uses doxepin as a model compound to study both the type and strength of interactions that occur during cITP. This work focuses on the binding interactions of doxepin with the buffer modifier Beta-cyclodextrin and the role that the counterion acetate plays in the cITP process.The insights gained in the doxepin cITP study were then used to develop an improved cITP-NMR method for the analysis of heparin and HS derived oligosaccharides, focusing on designing a buffer system that reduces the effects of current induced resonance broadening that occurs when cITP is coupled to microcoil NMR. Finally, this work demonstrates the coupling of cITP with a new microslot NMR probe design which eliminates the deleterious affects of the magnetic field produced by the separation.

Patterns of neighborhood environment attributes related to physical activity across 11 countries: a latent class analysis
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Neighborhood environment studies of physical activity (PA) have been mainly single-country focused. The International Prevalence Study (IPS) presented a rare opportunity to examine neighborhood features across countries. The purpose of this analysis was to: 1) detect international neighborhood typologies based on participants&#8217; response patterns to an environment survey and 2) to estimate associations between neighborhood environment patterns and PA.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					A Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was conducted on pooled IPS adults (N=11,541) aged 18 to 64 years old (mean=37.5 &#177;12.8 yrs; 55.6% women) from 11 countries including Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Hong Kong, Japan, Lithuania, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and the U.S. This subset used the Physical Activity Neighborhood Environment Survey (PANES) that briefly assessed 7 attributes within 10&#8211;15 minutes walk of participants&#8217; residences, including residential density, access to shops/services, recreational facilities, public transit facilities, presence of sidewalks and bike paths, and personal safety. LCA derived meaningful subgroups from participants&#8217; response patterns to PANES items, and participants were assigned to neighborhood types. The validated short-form International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) measured likelihood of meeting the 150 minutes/week PA guideline. To validate derived classes, meeting the guideline either by walking or total PA was regressed on neighborhood types using a weighted generalized linear regression model, adjusting for gender, age and country.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					A 5-subgroup solution fitted the dataset and was interpretable. Neighborhood types were labeled, &#8220;Overall Activity Supportive (52% of sample)&#8221;, &#8220;High Walkable and Unsafe with Few Recreation Facilities (16%)&#8221;, &#8220;Safe with Active Transport Facilities (12%)&#8221;, &#8220;Transit and Shops Dense with Few Amenities (15%)&#8221;, and &#8220;Safe but Activity Unsupportive (5%)&#8221;. Country representation differed by type (e.g., U.S. disproportionally represented &#8220;Safe but Activity Unsupportive&#8221;). Compared to the Safe but Activity Unsupportive, two types showed greater odds of meeting PA guideline for walking outcome (High Walkable and Unsafe with Few Recreation Facilities, OR= 2.26 (95% CI 1.18-4.31); Overall Activity Supportive, OR= 1.90 (95% CI 1.13-3.21). Significant but smaller odds ratios were also found for total PA.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					Meaningful neighborhood patterns generalized across countries and explained practical differences in PA. These observational results support WHO/UN recommendations for programs and policies targeted to improve features of the neighborhood environment for PA.

"Ahora marchamos, mañana votamos" : naturalization of Latino immigrants in San Diego and the current immigration reform movement
The motivations and opportunities for immigrants to naturalize continuously change. During the 2006 nation- wide mobilizations against House of Representatives bill 4437 the message : "Ahora marchamos, mañana votamos" (Today we march, tomorrow we vote) was a common banner carried amongst the marchers in the streets. I examine the extent to which the mobilizations created an opportunity for Latinos in the U.S. to naturalize and their motivations for becoming United States citizens within the context of this renewed mobilization for immigration reform. This research focuses on Latinos who have become or are in the process of becoming naturalized U. S. citizens since the 2006 mobilizations and who participated in citizenship workshops in San Diego. I also provide a closer look at the current campaign to promote immigration reform and naturalization in order to see how the tactics activists are employing now are related to those developed or adopted in 2006. My analysis employs theories about citizenship as well as a social movements lens. Using both theoretical perspectives helps expand our understanding of naturalization embedded within the larger immigration reform movement in the United States. The final part of this thesis suggests future implications these movements may have for the political incorporation of Latinos within the political opportunity structure created by the mobilizations of 2006. What does the future hold for Latino political participation and incorporation?

Dickens and Darwin
This dissertation examines how Charles Dickens&rsquo;s last completed novels, which appeared after the publication of Charles Darwin&rsquo;s <italic>The Origin of Species<italic> (1859), process Victorian anxieties about evolutionary origins and connections. I argue that Dickens&rsquo;s thematic work with origins and identity&mdash;specifically in <italic>Great Expectations<italic> (1860-61) and <italic>Our Mutual Friend<italic> (1864&ndash;65)&mdash;ultimately transcends the epistemological dislocations of Darwinism through an affirmation of self&ndash;determination and development over biological determination and origins. I examine how this is registered most powerfully in the novels&rsquo; emphasis on the liberatory and redemptive nature of self-narration and narrative fantasy. Furthermore, I read this aesthetic assertion as Dickens&rsquo;s developing response to Darwinian evolutionary theory and a bridge between the social commentary of his last two completed novels. This aesthetic counterpositioning demonstrates how Dickens&rsquo;s engagement with Darwinian science was complex and richly contradictory. I begin by summarizing and synthesizing Goldie Morgentaler&rsquo;s and Anny Sadrin&rsquo;s key work on issues of heredity and parentage in Dickens&rsquo;s oeuvre. As Morgentaler and Sadrin have argued, Dickens&rsquo;s work before 1859 primarily articulates a deterministic vision of cohesion and continuity in personal and social identity. Dickens&rsquo;s treatment of self-formation, however, becomes increasingly critical of hereditary determinants and undergoes a radical unraveling in his post&ndash;<italic>Origin<italic> work. Building on Morgentaler&rsquo;s and Sadrin&rsquo;s work, among others, I argue that <italic>Great Expectations<italic> is ultimately unable to harmonize the deterministic tenets of evolutionary theory with the liberatory desires that underwrite any act of self&ndash;narration. Retrospective narration becomes a site for remaking origins and identity through the fruitful distortions of storytelling. Dickens&rsquo;s next and last finished novel, <italic>Our Mutual Friend,<italic> extends and heightens this work. I present an extended reading and recontextualization of the lengthy soliloquy that bisects the book&mdash;in which the central character hijacks the narrative authority of the novel&rsquo;s third&ndash;person omniscient narrator and seeks to remake himself through a conspicuous act of self&ndash;narration. The Harmon soliloquy grapples with issues of origin and predestination and privileges even more emphatically the self-germinating potential of the individual over hereditary and environmental determinants.

      It can be argued that economic growth in developed countries benefits people in developing countries, as we can afford to give more development aid. I argue, however, that this has not been large enough to compensate for its the negative side effects, most notably that of a warming climate. Furthermore, the costs of current carbon fueled economic growth favoring present generations in the developed countries will mainly be paid by future generations of the poor in developing countries.

Suburbanization of Jobs And the Journey to Work
In recent years, a debate has brewed over whether the decentralization of employment has been beneficial from a regional standpoint. In this article, we focus on one aspect of the debate: how the relocation of office workers from a downtown to a suburban location affects commuting behavior. From a survey of 320 former downtown San Francisco workers who now work in the suburbs, we found that the average distance traveled remains essentially unchanged and that the average commuting speed declines. The most dramatic change is the switch from public transit to private auto commuting. In the aggregate, we estimate that the change in job location is associated with nearly a threefold increase in vehicle miles traveled to work. While from a personal standpoint, employees seem be to better off since they get to work faster in a superior form of transportation, from a larger social and environment perspective, the costs could be significant. More detailed analyses of submarkets reveal that the transportation impacts vary considerably depending on whether the original residence was in the suburbs or central city and whether relocated workers have moved their residences in recent years. In general, those who remain in San Francisco and become reverse commuters are worst off whereas those who move their residences out of the city are much better off in terms of transportation access. The research also shows that, consistent with theory, movers tend to trade-off larger lot living for a longer commute, even when jobs suburbanize. The article concludes that various users chargers, development fees, and transit service reforms are needed to respond to the rapid growth in suburban employment markets.

Other Transitions: Colombian Aesthetics in the Wake of Modernity
This dissertation examines the images, imaginaries, and aesthetic principles through which Colombian art and monumentalization practices have come to grips with the nation's internal armed conflict over the past three decades.  This period witnessed an orchestrated and hitherto unparalleled mobilization of national and international tools of liberal governance in the interest of bringing the conflict to a halt.  In spite of such efforts, massacres, human rights abuses, and forced displacements reached unprecedented levels by the late 1990s, intensified by a deepened alliance of armed violence and economic enterprise that accompanied post-Cold War neoliberal capitalist expansion.  Analyzing art, museum cultures, architectural forms, and urban development practices from this period, the dissertation explores the tension between the political investment in modern technologies of rights and the palpable exhaustion of modern frameworks for resolving the nation's crisis of violence. As elsewhere, the discourse of human rights has been invoked in Colombia as a primary regulative technology for restoring the humanity of social body, and "reordering the disorder" of the political body.  Other Transitions reads aesthetic productions against a range of human rights policies and practices--international humanitarian law, transitional justice measures, human rights protest genres, and urban renewal policies aimed at "humanizing" the city--in order to gain a more holistic understanding of the fashioning of this "crisis of the human."  Through a confrontation with the aesthetic, affective, and epistemological forms that comprise the scaffolding of the normative imaginaries of human rights, each of the works examined analyzes the limits of the emancipatory promise of rights, with a focus on representations of victimhood and available strategies for empathy, solidarity, and identification. "Other transitions," I argue, are political transitions that are elusive, deferred, and impossible to realize within the existing regime of modern globality.   If the post-dictatorship shifts of the 1980s and 1990s marked a turning point in the convergence of neoliberalism and democracy in Latin America, Colombia's suspended transition to "peace" necessitates a return to discussions of "transitions" beyond modern frameworks.  Reading cultural texts as an archive of this political impasse, my project thus reopens the question of what kinds of transitions are possible and necessary in this historical moment.

Urban Bias, Rural Sexual Minorities, and the Courts
This article examines the role of courts in rural sexual minorities’ lives. It focuses first on state action, explaining that courts’ failure to apply heightened scrutiny to sexual orientation classifications harms rural sexual minorities uniquely in family and employment law contexts, where judges explicitly invoke antigay rural norms to justify discriminatory treatment. It argues that by taking rural sexual minorities’ relative political powerlessness into account in Equal Protection claims, courts are more likely to find that all sexual orientation classifications are suspect. It focuses second on private discrimination, and it discusses ways to protect and strengthen rural sexual minorities’ privacy rights. It argues that privacy is central to protecting sexual minorities’ liberty to live, create families, and work in rural environments.

Political competition, emotions, and voting : the moderating role of individual differences
Why does the competitiveness of an election affect voter turnout? Previous research has focused on elite behavior in mobilizing political participation and voters' altered assessments about the importance of their vote. However, I argue that exposure to political competition activates voters' emotions---which in turn affect the decision to turnout---and that individual differences in threat sensitivity moderate this mediated relationship. After first elaborating a theory for these relationships, I use data from the 2008 National Election Study to demonstrate that heightened electoral competitiveness is associated with stronger emotional evaluations of the presidential candidates. To further elucidate the relationships, I collect a sample of 113 million status messages posted on the online social networking site Facebook during the 2008 presidential election. Automated content analysis reveals that users living in competitive "battleground" states are more likely to express emotion when they discuss politics on the site, and that emotional activation in status messages partially mediates the relationship between exposure to competition and self-reported voting. I next explore whether a genetic sensitivity to threat conditions the way that exposure to political contention affects voter turnout. The nascent genopolitics literature theorizes that genetic, psychological, and physiological differences should be integral in interpreting political stimuli from the environment, but there have been few empirical confirmations of this expectation. I find in two distinct datasets that people who carry a version of a gene that makes them especially sensitive to social stress are more responsive to the level of contention in their political environment. I follow up on this finding with a mobilization field experiment designed to activate emotions toward political competition. My dissertation is one of the first attempts to identify the specific causal mechanisms that underlie the effects of individual biological differences on political outcomes. This research topic is relevant and timely: as our country continues to polarize and the consequences of people's emotional reactions to political disagreement intensify, it is important to understand the causal mechanisms that relate political contention to political behavior

Konrad Lorenz and the National Socialists:  On the Politics of Ethology
The observation that science is influenced by politics has often been noted, but the details as to how, by whom, and to what ends, differ so much from case to case that the theme remains interesting. During the cold war it was, usually, physics and chemistry, occasionally mathematics, whose directions were thought to be influenced by political pressures (Snow, 1961). Biology came into prominence with the Vietnam War, and interest in an array of biological weapons, from defoliants to nerve gaseslikewise influenced a great deal of research. If one's memory goes back to earlier times, one also recalls the relations that developed between psychology and the politics of immigration and education, which had a  lasting impact on developments in the study of intelligence (Gould, 1981). Nor have the politics of religion been irrelevant (Durant, 1985).

The ‘Occupy’ Movement: Emerging Protest Forms and Contested Urban Spaces
The Occupy Movement represents the evolving nature of contemporary social movements. It employs traditional tactics as well as new tools of technology and alternative forms of organizing to articulate concerns. In an era of widening income inequality, record corporate profits, and government austerity measures, Occupy protestors claimed urban public spaces as sites of resistance this past year. By framing their cause as one driven by “the 99%”, corporate interests were successfully linked to a diverse set of economic impacts that united the masses, from diminishing prospects of employment to record foreclosures and crippling student debt. In claiming their right to the city, Occupiers created physical and political space for reasserting the power of the people. Occupiers’ seizing of public spaces and use of social media to promote and report acts of resistance suggest that in mediated societies, protests configured for virtual audiences are likely to become mainstays of urban social movements. The Occupy Movement embodies these developments and underscores the need for new thinking on how public spaces can facilitate participatory democracy. Using scholarly blogs and news reports, this paper tracks the movement and explores its implications on the governance of public space and the future of urban protests.

The influence of population density and sex ratio on reproduction and sex change of a temperate reef fish, <italic>Lythrypnus dalli</italic>
Population size is ultimately determined by processes influencing reproductive success of individuals. While processes influencing recruitment, growth and survival have received much attention in marine populations, factors influencing reproductive rates are less well understood. We tested for an influence of population density and sex ratio on reproduction (egg production) of populations, per capita reproduction of individuals, and the frequency of sex change in the bi-directionally sex-changing goby Lythrypnus dalli. By manipulating populations of, L. dalli on artificial reefs in the field and in laboratory aquaria, we provided evidence that reproduction was influenced by natural levels of variation in these two population characteristics and that these relationships differed between laboratory and field populations. While total egg production increased with increasing density in field populations, per capita reproduction declined. In contrast, per capita reproduction was not density-dependent in a small-scale laboratory experiment. While, the frequency of sex change was density-dependent in the laboratory experiment it was not on reefs in the field. Together these results indicate that small scale laboratory studies may not be sufficient for evaluating factors causing variation in reproductive success of natural populations of L. dalli. We suggest that decreasing social stability in larger populations in more complex environment drive these differences in sex-change behavior and individual reproductive success. In a separate experiment, we found that per capita reproductive success of females did not decline in female-biased field populations and thus, for a given density, populations with the most females tended to produce the most eggs. Reproductive success of males, however, strongly increased in female-biased populations and was much higher than average reproductive success of females. Despite the influence of sex ratio on relative reproductive success of males and females, we found no evidence that individuals use sex ratio as a cue for sex change. Rather, sex change of females could be predicted from their body size, and this relationship did not vary with population density. Sex change of males was uncommon and not predicted by on body size, population density, or sex ratio. These results have deepened understanding of the factors that influence individual reproductive success and reproductive rates of populations.

Changing Patterns of Chinese Immigration and Diaspora-Homeland Interactions in Singapore and the United States
After several decades’ hiatus, there has been a sustained surge of Chinese emigration and resurgent opportunities for transnational activity since 1978. In this paper, we engage with the burgeoning literature on transnationalism, focusing on the roles of immigrant agency, disaporic communities, and nation states to examine the means and consequences of diasporahomel and interactions in different host societies. Specifically, we address the following questions: (1) How do emigration histories and receiving contexts matter in shaping diasporic formation? (2) Who is involved in diaspora-homeland interactions and what roles do different actors play? (3) What bearing do immigrants’ transnational engagements have on their hostland integration? Through a comparative analysis of contemporary Chinese immigration to Singapore and the United States, we examine the interrelations among different actors and the roles each plays in cross-border activities. We find that differences in emigration histories and receiving contexts affect diasporic formation. We also find that immigrants maintain ties to their homeland, or sending state governments reach out to expatriates, through diasporic communities despite differences in diasporic formation. Moreover, varied levels of diaspora integration into the receiving countries affect how receiving states respond to immigrant transnationalism. Finally, we discuss the implications of homeland-diaspora interactions, showing that transnationalism is utilized by new Chinese immigrants as an alternative means to socioeconomic status attainment and that it facilitates, rather than hinders, immigrant integration into host societies.

Examining the Social Context in Identity Theory
This study advances identity theory, a prominent sociological social psychological theory, by investigating how the moral identity, moral behavior, and emotions operate in different social contexts, specifically when the moral identity is activated (or not activated) and when individuals are alone or in different types of groups. This extends identity theory by including key processes in social identity theory (identity activation and group membership) which have not been examined in the existing literature concerning the control systems approach to identity. A survey and experiment are administered to examine how the moral identity process operates for individuals in different social contexts. The survey measures individuals' moral identities. In the experiment, subjects are placed in a situation where they have an opportunity to behave immorally to gain an advantage over others. Results show that both the moral identity and group membership predict moral behavior in a situation. Direct activation of the moral identity is not required for it to influence moral behavior, which supports the moral identity as a principle-level identity. Implications of the study findings and recommendations for future research are discussed.

Millions on the Margins: Music, Ethnicity, and Censorship Among the Oromo of Ethiopia
This dissertation will demonstrate how music among the Oromo people of present day Ethiopia functions as a system for the preservation and negotiation of a uniquely Oromo identity, as well as a vehicle for resistance against the hegemony long ago established by outside ethnic groups. I will demonstrate how a long history of censorship of Oromo music by various ruling elites has made censorship one of the major features of Oromo social and aesthetic processes. This dissertation will therefore investigate the dynamic of the processes and dialogues through which Oromo identity becomes manifested, and in which music plays a deep role. In Ethiopia, a nation officially "independent" of European colonialism, "Ethiopian" culture was always equated with that of an ethnic minority. Not until the fall of Haile Selassie were the voices of other histories and previously peripheral groups given a chance to participate in the dialogue of Ethiopian statehood. I will use my ethnographic research from the US to Ethiopia to explore the relationship between performance art and state power in Ethiopia. Marginalized under Selassie, embraced and then shunned under the Derg and the current regime of Meles Zenawi, Oromo music demonstrates these complicated relationships. Oromos use music to "remember" past histories, bolster a sense of community among Oromo speaking groups, and fuel anti-colonial nationalism directed not at a European invader, but a black African one. Oromo music is used by the current regime in Ethiopia to present a face of multiculturalism. Yet while the government selectively preserves Oromo culture, Oromo musicians continue to be imprisoned, intimidated, and disappeared for making certain kinds of music. Because of this, various forms of censorship (both external and internal) have become a part of the Oromo music making process. Ethnic identity in general, and Oromo identity in particular, is performative. Music, like the ethnic identity it is used to bolster, is a performative act that creates a space for a polyvocal and heterogeneous dialogue through which Oromo identity is constituted. What can the relationship between Oromo music and the Ethiopian state tell us about ethno-nationalism, censorship, and memory? What does the selective preservation on the part of both Oromo and the Ethiopian government tell us about the role of performance in maintaining history and ethnic identity?

Monocentric and Polycentric Density Functions and Their Required Commutes
This paper examines the relationship between urban structure and commuting behavior. Analyzing the 1980 journey-to-work data for the Los Angeles region, this paper has shown that polycentric density functions fit the actual urban structure better than the conventional monocentric model. This finding indicates the preeminence of accessibility to major employment centers in location choices.
      This paper also estimates commute flows implied by the polycentric and monocentric functions. It finds the monocentric model very poor at explaining commuting behavior. The empirical results show that polycentric urban structure increases the urban commute. This finding helps to preserve the assumption that urban workers economize on commuting, and suggests that efforts to promote more efficient urban form, such as the jobs-housing balance policy, have the potential to succeed.

Essays in Labor and Development Economics
This dissertation is composed of three essays that study gender inequality in Thailand and the effect of job training on immigrant workers in the United States.  Essay 1 identifies the factors that account for mean earning differences in men and women, such as occupational sorting, demographic differences, human capital differences and the unexplained.  The outcome from OB decomposition indicates that the reduction over time in the mean wage gap is mostly due to an increase in female human capital accumulation and the improvement in female occupation outlook relative to men.  One of the reasons that a sizable mean wage gap still exists in Thailand, despite the increase in education level of women, is because the increase in female human capital accumulation over the past decade is overshadowed by an increase in the return to observables characteristics of menEssay 2 finds that the result from DFL decomposition is consistent with the OB decomposition.  We find that if Thai women possess similar observable characteristics as men, the gender wage inequality will be greater for the majority of the wage distribution, particularly, for middle to high income workers.  Chapter 3 studies the effects of job training on immigrant workers found in the U.S., using the data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP).  This essay is one of the first empirical papers that look into the effects of job training on immigrants in the United States, using Random Effect (RE) model, a Propensity Score Matching, a Quantile regression (QREQ) model and a semi-parametric reweighting method.  The Random Effects model indicates that the conditional effect of job training on the average earnings of immigrants (at 3.9 percent) is less than that of natives (at 7.6 percent).  From our distribution study, we found that job training had a positive effect on the wages of immigrant workers over most of the wage distribution.  The results from QREQ also show that immigrants enjoy the largest conditional job training premium at the lower and middle part of worker earning quantiles.  Examining counterfactual study, DFL reweighting technique shows that similar to Abadie, Angrist and Imbens (AAI) (2002) we found that the largest proportional impact of job training is at the upper part of the wage distribution for both natives and immigrants.  Nevertheless, we still found that job training increases the wage premium of lower and middle income workers.

Employment Suburbanization and the Journey to Work
Large scale suburbanization of employment has dramatically changed transportation and land use planning. Intersuburban commuting now dominates regional highway networks, and the automobile has replaced mass transit for many commutes. Planners' approaches to these developments vary from the pro-centralization approach of many environmentalists and transit advocates to the view that employment suburbanization enhances mobility. In the middle are those planners who seek a geographic match between suburban jobs and suburban housing.  This study examines one aspect of the debate on the effects of employment decentralization on regional mobility: the impact of growing suburban employment on the commutes of different income groups. This study suggests that suburban employment centers with high levels of multifamily housing will exhibit commute patterns in which household income and commute distance are largely independent. In contrast, In suburban areas where the development of dense housing has not kept pace with employment growth, it is hypothesized that new commute patterns are emerging wherein lower income households commute greater distances than their upper income counterparts. This pattern would be the reverse of the prediction of monocentric urban models for central city employment. These hypotheses are tested for San Francisco Bay Area communities using data from 1981 and 1989. Bivariate analyses generally supported the predicted effects of community employment base and housing stock on commute patterns by income. Nested multinomial logit models of the household residential location decision were estimated for workers in San Ramon and in northern Santa Clara County. The models appeared to demonstrate a positive effect of the availability of multifamily housing on the residential location decisions of low to moderate income households. In addition, workplace accessibility in general emerged as a powerful determinant of residential location. Forecasts of commute patterns using the estimated models indicated a potential for reducing long distance commutes by low to moderate income households through a policy encouraging multifamily housing construction in the vicinity of suburban employment centers.

Sacred, Epic and Picaresque: Violence and Genre in Cervantes
This dissertation analyzes selected texts from Cervantes and his classical and early modern sources, focusing on his treatment of violence. It aims to respond to Nabokov's famous indictment that Don Quixote was `the cruelest' book ever written. Building on a critical framework that includes the work of René Girard, Steven Pinker and Frederick de Armas among others, my study looks at violence specifically from the perspective of genre - primarily the chivalric, the epic and the picaresque - emphasizing how the author's thinking about violence was inevitably colored by pre-existing fictional paradigms. Instead of approaching violence by bringing ethics and philosophy to bear upon literature, such as the debate over the role of humor in the early modern period, I am more interested in examining how various literary categories inflect and nuance the author's treatment of sacred, chivalric, epic or picaresque violence. To this end I examine 1) the particularly quixotic conjunction of chivalry and hagiography manifest in the episode of the saints in Don Quixote Part II, 2) Cervantes' frequent, conflicted and evolving use of Virgilian formulas for the purpose of epic characterization, and 3) the tendency of the picaresque genre to feature prominent facial and bodily scars on its protagonists, a marker for social stigma that the author adapted quite cleverly in his Prologue to the Novelas ejemplares. This analysis ultimately concludes that Cervantes worked within well-established classical and early modern traditions, infusing new life into them with often brilliantly unexpected results.

International rules, national implementation : how domestic politics condition the effects of international legal commitments
How and when do commitments to international institutions affect the behavior of national governments? This dissertation provides substantive and methodological advances in answering this key question in international relations research. Chapter 1 addresses the selection effect problem in this literature, which threatens inferences we can make about the effects of treaty commitments. I argue that in order to address this problem, we first need to estimate the treaty commitment preferences of states. I develop a procedure designed to do so that combines ideal-point estimation and propensity- score matching and apply this procedure to test the effects of three human rights agreements. Chapter 2 analyzes the role of domestic courts in enforcing international commitments. I develop a theory that predicts when courts can be effective enforcers based on the costs of producing evidence and the legal standards of proof. I test this theory using the procedure developed in Chapter 1. Chapter 3 analyzes the role of domestic legislative veto players in enforcing international commitments. While much of the literature assumes veto players can make commitments more credible in all areas, I argue that in the human rights context their ability to do so depends on the extent to which leaders can effectively violate human rights without legislative approval and in secret. I test this theory using the procedure developed in Chapter 1. Finally, Chapter 4 returns to the estimates of treaty commitment preferences developed in Chapter 1. I analyze the treaty commitment preference space in order to better understand the key predictors of these preferences. I find that economic policy is the clearest and most consistent predictor of treaty commitment preferences, including with respect to non-economic treaties

This dissertation is comprised of three autonomous chapters all of which have one thing in common: they utilize experimental manipulations to answer questions of interest to economists and/or society. Chapter 1 finds significant evidence of discrimination against African Americans in the apartment rental market throughout the entire United States - subtle discrimination which would likely go unnoticed by any individual, though the effects are likely felt by many individuals. Chapter 2 finds evidence of people actively exploiting others' perceptions in order to obtain a favorable appearance - subjects will behave selfishly while attempting to appear selfless or egalitarian. Chapter 3 shows that a simple manipulation in the wording of a problem can result in subjects playing strategies more closely aligned with Nash Equilibrium predicted behavior

Social stratification and the healthcare safety net
Social inequalities can produce disparities in healthcare access and quality.  This dissertation explores relationships between two social stratification processes- community residential segregation and social capital- on the supply of U.S. urban safety net providers. The first paper, "Community residential segregation and the local supply of Federally Qualified Health Centers," used data from the Area Resource File and the U.S. Census to examine growth in FQHCs in urban counties from 2000 to 2007.  Residential segregation by poverty and race/ethnicity were measured using the dissimilarity index. Logistic and negative binomial regression models were used for dichotomous and count outcomes, respectively. Residential segregation measures were associated with both county FQHC supply at baseline and the addition of new FQHCs over time.  Residential segregation may produce geographic segregation of health services, such that FQHCs may be required to fill the gaps arising from provider maldistribution.   The second paper, "Residential segregation and the survival of U.S. urban public hospitals," used data from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey from 1987 to 2007.   Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate competing risks of hospital closure versus privatization.  Poverty rates, intermediate poverty segregation, a low proportion of black residents, and low black residential segregation were associated with closure.  Poverty associations suggest that areas with a high need for safety net services may be at risk to lose them, but segregated black communities may successfully advocate for maintenance of public hospitals.  In contrast, Hispanic residential segregation was associated with privatization.  Areas with segregated Hispanic communities may be less inclined to support public provision of services and have reduced opposition to privatization.The third paper analyzed the same sample of urban public hospitals in relation to measures of community social capital.  Voting rates were associated with closure, whereas bridging social capital among elites was associated with privatization. The findings suggest that social capital among privileged groups bears more influence on public hospital outcomes than vertical connections between the disadvantaged and those in power.Taken together, the three papers suggest that social determinants may dictate both the need and societal response for the safety net.

Ten Years of Frequent Users in an Inner City Emergency Department
Introduction:The purpose of this study was to determine if differences could be detected in the presentation patterns and admission rates among frequent emergency department users (FEDU) of an urban emergency department over a 10-year period.
      
         Methods: This was an IRB approved, retrospective review of all patients who presented to the ED 5 or more times for 3 distinct time periods: “year 0” 11/98-10/99, “year 5” 11/03–10/04, and “year 10” 11/08–10/9. FEDU were grouped into those with 5–9, 10–14, 15–19, and ≥ 20 visits per year. Variables analyzed included number of visits, disposition, and insurance status. We performed comparisons using Kolmogorov-Smirnov and chi-square tests. A P < 0.05 was considered significant.
      
         Results: We found a a 66% increase in FEDU patients over the decade studied, with a significant increase in both the number of FEDU in each visit frequency category over the 3 time periods (P < 0.0001), as well as the total number of visits by each group of FEDU (P < 0.0001). The proportion of FEDU visits for the 5–9 group resulting in admission increased from 25.9% to 29% from year 0 to year 10 (P < 0.001), but not for the other visit groups. In comparing admission rates between FEDU groups, the admission rate for the 5–9 group was significantly higher than the ≥ 20 group for the year 5 time period (P < 0.001) and the year 10 time period (P < 0.001) and showed a similar trend, but not significant, at year 0 (P = 0.052). The overall hospital admission rate for emergency patients over the same time span remained stable at 22-24%. The overall proportion of uninsured FEDU was stable over the decade studied, while the uninsured rate for the overall ED population for the same time periods increased.
      
         Conclusion: The results demonstrate the FEDU population is not a homogeneous group of patients. Increased attention to differences among FEDU groups is necessary in order to plan more effective interventions. West J Emerg Med. 2013;14(3):243–246.

Three essays on behavioral economics
This dissertation investigates two topics on behavioral economics: reference-dependent preferences and social utility. Chapter 1 and 2 provide field evidence from labor market and financial market to support reference-dependent model that treats expectations as reference points. Chapter 3 explores the implications of social distance on the endogenous emergence of personal relationships and impersonal market exchange. Chapter 1 : A model of cabdrivers' labor supply is proposed, building on Farber's (2005, 2008) empirical analyses and Kószegi and Rabin's (2006; henceforth "KR") theory of reference-dependent preferences. Following KR, the proposed model has targets for hours as well as income, determined by proxied rational expectations. The model, estimated with Farber's data, reconciles his finding that stopping probabilities are significantly related to hours but not income with Colin Camerer et al.'s (1997) negative "wage" elasticity of hours; and avoids Farber's criticism that estimates of drivers' income targets are too unstable to yield a useful model of labor supply. Chapter 2 : An investor' aversion to losses relative to a reference point in the stock market predicts a V-shaped relationship between the optimal position in a stock and current gains from that stock. Estimates from Odean's (1999) individual trading records show that (i) the predicted V-shape relationship exists for a large majority of investors, and (ii) expectations are the most likely determinant of investors' reference points. The V-shaped relationship and the implication of the initial purchase decision that expectations are mostly positive yield a simple explanation of the disposition effect. Chapter 3 : Personal relationships and impersonal exchange have been previously modeled in ways that prevent them from coexisting in equilibrium as contract enforcement mechanisms. Empirical evidence nonetheless suggests that they sometimes coexist. This paper introduces social surplus into exchange payoff, which is determined by social distance and specific to personal relationships but not to impersonal exchange. This approach allows the two modes of exchange to coexist in equilibrium. The possibility of impersonal exchange improves welfare and equality among buyers in general. But there also exist cases where competition between the two forms of exchange makes welfare and equality deteriorate

Online Environmental Citizenship: Blogs, Green Marketing and consumer sentiment in the 21st Century
Consumers’ environmental consciousness is widespread with public acceptance of the global environmental crisis causing shifts in the debates within the environmental movement. The last three decades have seen consumers’ environmental consciousness grow as the environment has become a mainstream issue encouraging individual, government and company rethinking. Our longitudinal, empirical research findings are innovative and contribute by exploring global green blog sites using a content analysis, qualitative research technique Leximancer, which is an ideal analysis method that captures the essence of large volumes of textual data to draw significance. This snapshot monitored public opinion and found important concepts discussed over two, four month periods including energy, company, action, products, climate change, emissions, business, carbon, electric cars, organic and plastic. Our results revealed bloggers believe themselves to be influential and instrumental in creating change through environmental citizenship actions by creating an opportunity to disseminate environmental knowledge and attitude that exists between green bloggers and non-green bloggers.

Psychosocial Predictors of Giving Health-Related Social Control to a Partner
According to social control theory, social relationships may be beneficial to health when partners monitor and attempt to improve one another's health behaviors (Rook & Pietromonaco, 1987; Tucker & Anders, 2001).  This dissertation expanded upon current theoretical models of social control by proposing the Individual Differences in Social Control (IDISC) Model, which considers the characteristics of who is most likely to offer and receive health-related social control and the downstream impacts on a partner's health behaviors and health outcomes.  Furthermore, this study examined social control primarily in the context of friends, who may be important to health early in the lifespan. Pairs of students signed up to take part in a University-supported weight loss challenge, and psychosocial surveys, along with physical assessments at the Campus Health Center, were completed at four waves spanning over six months.In the context of a dyadic longitudinal study, relationship satisfaction and personality were both found to significantly predict the giving and receiving of health-related social control, according to self-reports, and to a lesser extent, partner-reports.   Specifically, higher relationship satisfaction, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and extraversion tended to predict helpful social control attempts (e.g., more positive and direct social control attempts).  Whereas social control demonstrated inconsistent associations with health behaviors (e.g., eating healthy, physical activity), both positive social control and health behavior reports were associated with having a lower subsequent BMI.  Perceived obstacles to weight loss showed associations with personality traits, giving social control to a partner, health behavior engagement at baseline and last report, and perhaps most importantly, to higher BMI and body fat percentage both at baseline and last report. All together, the present findings suggest that theoretical models of social control processes should be expanded to reflect individuals' differential likelihood of giving and receiving health-related social control from a partner, such as a friend, spouse, or relative, across the lifespan in order to more fully portray the processes involved.

[city, green, spectacle]

Spectacle in the New Green City
Nation-states have been criticized for their collective failure to aggressively combat climate change. Amid the foot-dragging, many cities have styled themselves as climate insurgents, ‘taking the lead’ through bold, creative efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Emerging from these efforts have been high-profile, highly symbolic projects: the green roof atop Chicago’s city hall, New York City’s MillionTreesNYC program, and San Francisco’s network of parks reclaimed from parking spaces (called ‘parklets’). This paper argues that such projects represent a new “mobilization of the spectacle”—a reflection of a popular desire to reimagine the city, but produced on the terms of (and even on behalf of) market forces and neoliberal reason. With the parklets of San Francisco serving as a case study, this paper attempts to reveal the influence of the neoliberal economic order in the production of the green urban spectacle.

Reading the (In)visible Race: African-American Subject Representation and Formation in American Literature
This project began with the intention to examine the connection between the aesthetic and the political in American literature's construction of African-American subjectivity, or the relationship between resistance and representation in literary portrayals of the African-American subject. I was specifically interested in the moments in American literature where the convergence between aesthetic form and political practice creates a particular crisis in representation for African-American subjectivity,many times rendering scholarly discussion of these problematic texts dismissive of their purported politics, or even non-existent. Some of the questions I wanted to grapple with included how one accounts for texts that have "good politics" in mind when written, yet still possess racist or "bad political" aspects through the manner in which they are presented, and the manner in which the subject position of the author affects ourperception of the text.I chose to discuss American fictional texts whose readers and critics have experienced difficulty reconciling the text's aesthetic properties with the political moves they seemed to be making in their representation of African-American subjectivity. Through close analysis of Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, Harriet Jacobs's Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Frances Harper's abolitionist and post-Civil War poetry, and her novel Iola Leroy, Mark Twain's Puddn'head Wilson, Carl Van Vechten's Nigger Heaven, Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God, and research of the criticism surrounding these texts, I found that we should not necessarily reject the notion that aesthetic representation always implies a political stance. However, if ideology and form are so closely connected, than closely examining the aesthetics of a text becomes crucial to understanding its political repercussions and the cultural work it is performing. Ultimately, I end with a plea that we acknowledge the complexity of resistance for the African-American subject and expand the ways in which we as readersand critics tend to define it. It is our continuing exploration of the complexity of racial representation in literature and cultural subject  formation/construction that aids us in understanding and overcoming racism.

LGBT Vote 2012
Exit polls from the 2012 presidential election suggest that 5% of the electorate identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual. These LGB voters overwhelmingly supported President Obama for re-election. Exit polls suggest that the President garnered 76% of the LGB vote compared to 22% support for Gov. Mitt Romney. The strong LGBT support for President Obama was likely a key factor in his ability to win the national popular vote and the very close election in Florida. This research brief considers the impact of the LGBT vote on the Electoral College and explores the extent to which LGBT identity impacts the LGBT vote.

Defining Telecommuting
Both as a business response to internal business problems, and as a transportation demand management (TDM) strategy, telecommuting is gaining acceptance in the United States and elsewhere. Yet there is no consensus on what actually does and does not constitute telecommuting. This paper first indicates why approaching such a consensus is important. It then discusses the definition of telecommuting in two different contexts. In the first case, telecommuting is considered in the abstract, in the context of a variety of other remote work options. Each of the remote work options is classified according to its transportation impacts and its managerial implications. In the second case, the efforts of one group to define non-home-based telecommuting in the specific context of an air quality regulation designed to reduce travel are documented.

Acculturation, behavioral risk factors, and cardio- metabolic dysfunction in Mexican American women living in a border region
Acculturation has been associated with health behaviors, and to a lesser extent, health outcomes among Latinos; however, inconsistencies exist regarding the nature of these relationships. Moreover, little is known about the underlying mechanisms linking acculturation to Latino health outcomes. The current study examined the relationship between acculturation, behavioral risk factors, and cardio-metabolic dysfunction in Mexican American women, and evaluated the contribution of social and economic pathways to observed associations. Participants were a random sample of 302 Mexican American women (mean age 49.77 years), recruited from communities with wide-ranging socioeconomic status (SES) located on the United States (US) side of the Tijuana (Mexico) - San Diego (US) border. Women underwent a clinical exam and completed a battery of questionnaires including demographic (age, US exposure, education, and income), cultural (language acculturation, familism, fatalism, religiosity), social (social support, sociability), and behavioral (leisure-time physical activity, sedentary behavior, walking, fruit and vegetable servings, and dietary fat) variables. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) and structural equation models (SEMs) were performed in the total sample. CFAs revealed single latent constructs for English language acculturation (childhood language, English proficiency, and adult language patterns), SES (education and income), resilient cultural values (familism and religiosity), and social resources (social support and sociability). SEMs showed statistically significant direct effects of English language acculturation to more sedentary behavior and resilient cultural values to more self-reported walking. In addition, the indirect effects of US exposure to more sedentary behavior through language acculturation, English language acculturation to more sedentary behavior through SES, and resilient cultural values to more fruit and vegetable servings through social resources were also significant (CFI = 0.90, RMSEA = .10, SRMR = 0.04). Finally, significant mediated effects were found for English language acculturation to lower cardio-metabolic dysfunction via higher SES, and higher SES to lower cardio -metabolic dysfunction via lower fatalism (CFI= .89, RMSEA = .11, SRMR = .04). Behavioral variables did not appear to mediate the acculturation and cardio-metabolic dysfunction relationship. Acculturation and related cultural variables were associated with behavioral risk factors and cardio- metabolic dysfunction in middle-aged Mexican American women. SES and social resources may represent relevant pathways in explaining these associations

Florence Richardson Wyckoff (1905-1997), Fifty Years of Grassroots Social ActivismVolume III: Watsonville Years 1960-1985
Florence Wyckoff's three-volume oral history documents her remarkable, lifelong work as a social activist, during which she has become nationally recognized as an advocate of migrant families and children. From the depression years through the 1970s, she pursued grassroots, democratic, community-building efforts in the service of improving public health standards and providing health care, education, and housing for migrant families. Major legislative milestones in her career of advocacy were the passage of the California Migrant Health Act and, in 1962, the Federal Migrant Health Act, which established family health clinics for the families who follow the crops along both the eastern and western migrant agricultural streams.
      This volume continues Wyckoff's story of the arduous political struggle for federal and state legislation providing for health services for migrants, the California and Federal Migrant Health Acts. Once this legislation was in place, Wyckoff was involved in a new battle to insure continuing budget appropriations for the migrant health programs. In her narration, Wyckoff provides additional chapters on her fifteen-year tenure on the Governor's Advisory Committee on Children and Youth, including the involvement of the Rosenberg Foundation in funding pioneering migrant public health services in the San Joaquin Valley; the changing living and social conditions of migrant workers during the period 1948-58; and the organizing of farmworker communities through citizen education and political action. Wyckoff also discusses many individuals who were significant in different areas of the struggle-- Anthony Rios and the CSO; notable growers, labor contractors, and public-spirited physicians, politicians and congressional staff members. The culmination of her varied work on the Governor's Committee was the organizing of the five Conferences on Families Who Follow the Crops, held in California between 1959 and 1967.
      The remaining two sections in this volume focus on Wyckoff's national and local work addressing and linking the issues of poverty and citizen participation. She chronicles her membership during the Kennedy Administration on the Study Committee charged with conceptualizing policy initiatives for what later came to be known as the War on Poverty. Some of the topics in this section include the concept of mainstreaming the poor; the 1960 White House Conference on Children and Youth; working with urban youth and the Watts Riots; the origin of the Headstart Program; and the function of the Citizens' Crusade Against Poverty.
      In the volume's final section, Wyckoff discusses her philosophy of citizen participation; describes how the War on Poverty emerged in Santa Cruz County; outlines some of its political and social consequences; and indicates how the Watsonville community defined and attempted to meet the housing, educational, and health needs of the migrant families so crucial to the region's agricultural economy.

The Future Impact of Same-Sex Marriage: More Questions Than Answers
The greatest potential for changes in the social meaning of marriage will arise in three areas for which there is empirical evidence of significant differences between gay and straight couples: division of household labor, sexual exclusivity & childrearing. While the number of same-sex couples in the population is too small to produce significant change in overall patterns of behavior, the issue of gay marriage has generated so much attention and debate that a mixed process of gay assimilation to and effect on the social meaning of marriage is a reasonable expectation.

No such thing as society : : art and the crisis of the European welfare state
No Such Thing as Society: Art and the Crisis of the European Welfare State addresses contemporary art in the context of changing European welfare states. Mapping a tripartite turn from Institutional Critique to Relational Aesthetics, from extensive government support of the arts towards reduced arts funding, and from the welfare state towards the neoliberal state, the study more specifically sketches a shift from "society" to "community." The past thirty years have evidenced a substantial restructuring and, in some cases, a partial dismantling of the European welfare states. As a result, society is increasingly characterized, not in terms of a cohesive social body, but rather as a collection of disparate populations and communities. It is a central argument of this investigation that these societal changes are manifest in contemporary artworks, both in the social context they reference and the conception of "audience" they imply. Chapter 1 is devoted to an overview of the welfare state's impact on the arts, from its post-war formation to its crisis since the 1980s. I argue that the welfare state's founding conception of a unified social body was put to the test, first by intellectual critiques of the 1960s and 1970s and later by neoliberal challenges during the ensuing decades. Chapter 2 outlines a turn from Institutional Critique to Relational Aesthetics. Despite being indebted to theoretical critiques of state, works by Hans Haacke, Marcel Broodthaers, Daniel Buren, Artists Placement Group and Stephen Willats were deeply embedded within this very structure. By contrast, the relational practices championed by the French curator Nicolas Bourriaud, I propose, share several characteristics with "community arts." A catch-all term for arts and cultural policy since the 1990s under New Labour in the U.K., this art-centric outreach, which was thought capable of supplanting social programs, was defined by small-scale encounters with constituencies demarcated precisely by these relational initiatives. Chapters 3, 4 and 5 are devoted to case studies of specific artworks in important local welfare frameworks--France, the Nordic countries and the United Kingdom. All engaged in negotiative relationships with state-funded museums and institutions of art, I suggest that works by Thomas Hirschhorn, Superflex, Mark Wallinger, and Andreas Siekmann, among others, exhibit an operation of "institutional displacement." While still situated within post-war structures of art, these contemporary art practices do not address these immediate enclosures, but rather take on, whether explicitly or implicitly, the category of the welfare state and its social institutions. Taking as their point of departure present social issues, these artworks reference the moment of resistance to the state of the 1960s and 1970s as well as what preceded it, namely the post-war formation of the welfare system. In their references to multiple "states" of welfare, the contemporary artworks discussed in the volume embody the compromise formation that characterizes the current European state model. Given that older social programs today cohabitate with recent policy initiatives in most European countries, it is not the case that one state formation has entirely taken the place of an outmoded structure; the welfare goal of providing for all is contradictorily met with new policies that narrowly focus on individualized self-help. While artists frequently want to defend post-war comprehensive social schemes, their efforts are complicated by the intervening advents of poststructuralism, postmodernism and postcolonialism. Contemporary European artworks thus demonstrate the crisis of conceiving of all, whilst attending to difference, without submitting to the prevailing forces of social fragmentation

Relational representation : nongovernmental actors in global politics
The emergence of nongovernmental actors within global politics challenges several of our assumptions about what constitutes a legitimate political actor beyond the nation -state. For many, nongovernmental actors are only a signal of some larger political issue. To some, the new political actors serve as evidence for the status of sovereignty. They either signal a shift to a post-sovereign politics or are trivialized in an effort to reaffirm state sovereignty. To others, nongovernmental actors are seen as laying the groundwork for the coming cosmopolitan global community. Few have considered the practices of nongovernmental actors on their own terms.

To others, nongovernmental actors are seen as laying the groundwork for the coming cosmopolitan global community. Few have considered the practices of nongovernmental actors on their own terms. In Part Two, through an examination of Hobbes and Rousseau, I argue that the central difficulty limiting the concept of representation is the focus on mediation, which prevents the consideration of alternative claims to represent. Then, in Part Three, I introduce a rethinking of representation that is anchored in responding to the other, rather than in the total mediation suggested by acting for the other. The incorporation of intersubjectivity leads to an understanding of relational representation. This responsive form of representation, I argue, is the type of representation evident in the practices of nongovernmental actors. They are representative in the sense that they work within a relationship that works to continually re- present the represented as persons increasingly capable of using their agency. This situation generates a standard of accountability that can then be used when assessing the legitimacy of a nongovernmental actor's claim to represent other persons or communities. By connecting the practices of nongovernmental actors to the capacity to engage in relational representation, it is evident that nongovernmental actors practice a new politics. Understanding their practice-based representation is valuable for both lending clarity to our contemporary political experiences and for serving as the catalyst to rethink the concept of representation for new political times

The Representational Sources of Political Inequality
Among the main tenets of American democracy are liberty, popular sovereignty, and equality. While each has seen expansion over the course of American history, the recent growth in economic inequality could threaten each of these core democratic features. As political equality is a prerequisite central to each of these values, I investigate the question: where does political inequality come from? In order to research the sources of political inequality, I examine the nature of inequality in each of three aspects of the American governmental system: institutions (e.g. Congress), individuals (e.g. voters), and theinteraction between the two (e.g. responsiveness).At its founding, the American government was set up to be a republican democracy. In this light, I focus on the role of representation in the U.S. political system and the degreeto which certain groups receive higher levels of responsiveness, defined as the level of correspondence between constituency preferences and a legislator's behavior (e.g. Miller andStokes 1963; Achen 1978), and other groups do not. Because modern democratic theory assumes the continued responsiveness of the government to all citizens (considered aspolitical equals) my primary focus is to examine the degree to which this equal responsiveness is broken, which can be a source of political inequality (Dahl 1971). The argument that I make throughout the dissertation is that economic inequality greatly affectspolitical inequality. While this thesis may not seem novel, recent studies that have uncovered evidence of unequal governmental responsiveness have been unable to provide an accountof why this occurs (Gilens 2005; Bartels 2008).In the dissertation I explore three questions. First, how pervasive is political inequality? In order to answer this question I examine the behavior of members of Congress and the degree to which they respond to different economic classes. As Congress is themain body designed to represent the people's voice, I focus intensely on this institution.The second question, which focuses on the role of the people, is: Does the public view inequality as a problem? In researching this question, I will examine individual preferencesfrom the mass public in order to understand people's attitudes toward inequality. Individual indifference to economic inequality and an inability to hold elected officials accountable could be a main source of political inequality. Finally, I examine the interaction between individual (and group) preferences and political institutions and ask the question: What accounts for legislator bias toward different groups? To this end, I examine the influenceson legislator behavior such as member personal wealth, party, competitiveness, constituent preference (majority and subconstituency), constituent participatory factors (e.g. voting,volunteering, donating, etc.), and political knowledge.

Reactivating the Social Body in Insurrectionary Times: A Dialogue with Franco 'Bifo' Berardi
The Italian theorist Franco “Bifo” Berardi has spent a lifetime participating in revolutionary movements and thinking through their complexities. He is best known in the English-speaking world for his association with the Italian autonomist movement Operaismo (“workerism”) and its prominent attempts to transform communist politics by resituating the “needs, desires, and organizational autonomies” of workers at the foundation of political praxis (Genosko and Thoburn 2011: 3). This text assembles excerpts from three interviews we conducted with Berardi over the course of the insurrectionary year 2011. Each of our conversations coincided with notable developments in last year’s mobilizations and our interviewee’s enthusiasm about those events is evident at certain points in the transcript. Yet while Berardi is generally optimistic about the revolts and the “reactivation of the social body” that they seem to imply, he reminds us that protest alone will not be enough to win the genuine kinds of autonomy that he suggests are necessary. He argues that dogmas of growth, competition and rent have so colonized every sphere of “human knowledge” that they have begun to threaten the very survival of what he calls “social civilization.” The hegemonic grip of this “epistemological dictatorship” has altered our capacity to feel empathy towards one another, severing fundamental bonds of inter-personal connection. Yet in spite of this dark diagnosis, Berardi is not a doomsayer and he always leaves open the possibility of transformation and escape. He counsels that our best shot at deliverance lies in the development of new strategies of withdrawal, refusal, sabotage, and the negotiation of new “lines of flight” from the late-capitalist forms of domination.

Acculturation and Religiosity as Moderators of  Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors among South Asians in the United States
South Asians are people with origins in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, and the Maldives.  In the United States (US), South Asians are among the fastest growing ethnic/immigrant groups with a growth rate of 70% from the 2000 to the 2010 Census, now consisting of 1-2% of the total population.   California is the state with the largest population of South Asians in the US.  South Asians have a genetic tendency towards insulin resistance and central adiposity, increasing their risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), coronary heart disease, and diabetes mellitus.  Immigrants to Western countries may have an amplified risk of CVD due to the adoption of a Western diet and physical inactivity.  Two potential social factors that may moderate CVD risk factors among South Asians in the US are acculturation and religiosity.  Chapter 1 provides a literature review of acculturation and health, CVD risk factors among South Asians and how they may vary by duration of residence in the US, and religion and health.  Conceptual models for the relationships between acculturation and CVD risk factors and between religiosity and obesity are also presented in Chapter 1.Acculturation to American cultural practices has generally been associated with unfavorable changes in CVD risk factors among foreign-born populations.  There are few validated measures of acculturation for Asian Americans or South Asians, and acculturation is often operationalized as duration of residence in the US despite problems with this proxy measure.  Chapter 2, the first manuscript, examines the validity of acculturation proxy measures, such as duration of residence in the US, with self-reported acculturation measures in validated acculturation scales using the California Asian Indian Tobacco Survey.  We found that greater duration of residence in the US, greater percentage of lifetime in the US, and younger age at immigration were associated with more American acculturated responses to the items for South Asian immigrants.  We also developed an 11-item acculturation scale for South Asians using existing survey items with an internal consistency reliability of 0.73 and examined the psychometric properties of the scale.Chapter 3, the second manuscript, uses national and state-level cross-sectional data to examine the association of duration of residence in the US with self-reported CVD risk factors among South Asian adults using regression analysis.  We found that South Asians immigrants who have resided in the US for greater than 15 years were more likely to be overweight or obese, drink alcohol, eat five or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day, and engage in physical activity compared with more recent immigrants in models adjusting for confounding socio-demographic characteristics, health status, health access, and health behaviors.  Age at immigration modified the relationship between duration of residence in the US and body mass index, binge drinking, and alcohol use.  Duration of residence was not associated with increased risk for hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, fast food intake, or soda intake in adjusted models.Religious involvement has been associated with improved health practices and outcomes.  Longitudinal and cross-sectional studies have found lower morality rates, lower prevalence of smoking, and better self-reported health status among individuals who report high levels of religiosity or attend religious services frequently.  However, religiosity has also been associated with greater risk of obesity.  For South Asians, religiosity and religious participation may be an especially important concept to understand in health promotion because of the dietary restrictions associated with traditional Indian religions and community fellowship for immigrant populations.  Chapter 4, the third manuscript, examines the association of religiosity with obesity among a multi-religious group of South Asians in California using regression analysis.  We found that high self-identified religiosity was significantly associated with higher BMI after adjusting for socio-demographic and acculturation measures, including the acculturation scale developed in Chapter 2.  Highly religious South Asians had 1.53 greater odds (95% CI: 1.18, 2.00) of being overweight or obese than low religiosity immigrants, though this varied by religious affiliation.  Religiosity was associated with greater odds of being overweight/obese for Hindus (OR 1.54; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.22) and Sikhs (OR 1.88; 95% CI: 1.07, 3.30), but not for Muslims (OR 0.69; 95% CI: 0.28, 1.70). The findings from this dissertation may provide information on relevant social and cultural norms that may be incorporated in the conceptual model and design of a cardiovascular disease prevention lifestyle change intervention culturally tailored for South Asians in the US.

The Role of Social Status during the Transition from Adolescence into Adulthood on Smoking and Alcohol Behaviors
Across the life course, substance use is highest in adolescence and young adulthood in the U.S. Although substance use declines with age, a significant number of young adults go beyond normative to problematic use. Despite the strong relationship between low social status and poor health, substance use varies by social status in inconsistent ways. Smoking is higher among lower social status groups. Alcohol use is higher among higher social status groups. Substance use is often higher among Whites compared to racial/ethnic minorities. Problematic substance use is often higher among minorities compared to Whites. These inconsistent patterns may be due to drug type (e.g., smoking vs. alcohol) or difficulty in assessing social status during the transition to adulthood and across race/ethnicity.The goal of this dissertation is to ascertain the effects of social status on substance use behaviors across race/ethnicity during the transition to adulthood using secondary data analysis of three waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Using social stratification theories and the life course perspective, this study conceptualized social status as a life-course construct from adolescence (ages 12-17) to young adulthood (ages 18-26) and adulthood (ages 24-32). Furthermore, social status was examined across the domains of economic, human, and social capitals. Cigarette smoking and heavy episodic alcohol use served as the key outcomes.  Through a person-oriented framework, latent class analysis captured the ebb and flow of social status advantages and disadvantages with four latent groups for the domains of economic and social capitals, and five groups for the domain of human capital. These latent classes were substantively similar across Whites, Blacks, and Latinos; however, variations within subgroups differed. Regardless of domain or race/ethnicity, persistently low social status had higher smoking prevalence when compared to other groups. For heavy episodic drinking, there was no clear pattern across domains and race/ethnicity, which suggest a complex picture that may be difficult to disaggregate. Overall, these findings highlight several dimensions of social status that present opportunities to reduce substance use disparities, and reveal life-course social status groupings from adolescence to adulthood that may provide important avenues to prevent problematic substance use.

Youth and diminished responsibility
This work is focused on two related questions. First, why does youth diminish moral responsibility for actions? And second, what does the answer to this question tell us about responsibility more generally. I argue that children are not exempt from moral responsibility on the grounds that they are not moral agents. Instead, I argue that in the right circumstances, many young people are morally responsible for their actions. I then develop a theory of diminished or partial responsibility intended to explain why and when young people are eligible for partial excuse. The law's normal construction of the person presumes that people are competent, free, and generally rational individuals who can be expected to understand the demands of the law. All of these assumptions are challenged by immaturity, so the courts have had to develop a theory of immature agency. The reality of this theory is more complicated than the explicit brightline age distinctions between children and adult permits. I argue that person who has the capacities and skills for good normative judgment is normatively competent. Normative competence is a set of skills and capacities, a person may have them in degree. This approach to responsibility helps accommodate both the progressive nature of moral development, and the fact that having judgmental competence in one setting does not guarantee one will have it under other circumstances. Normative competence has two elements--reasons- responsiveness and self-ownership. Reasons-responsiveness provides justification for attributing moral agency to a person. It makes possible judgments like "Jim did a bad thing." This is presupposed by judgments of moral deservingness. But it is not enough to establish moral accountability, which makes possible judgments like "Jim deserves blame for doing a bad thing." To capture accountability, I argue that normative competence must include an ownership condition. A person owns an action when she makes it independently and authentically. Ownership is a constructive skill at bringing independent judgments in line with authentic ones. This is something that separates people who are accountable in the fullest sense from those who are not

Dispersion of Identity Meanings: Exploration and Implications
Identity theory conceptualizes identities as sets of meanings individuals attach to the self (Burke and Stets 2009). Individuals seek support for their identities in situations by acting in ways to obtain feedback about the self from others. This feedback is compared to one's identity meanings in situations. If the feedback matches one's identity meanings, individuals feel good. If the feedback does not match one's identity meanings, individuals feel bad and are motivated to change the situation to bring feedback into alignment with their identity meanings. This comparison process is conceptualized as a control system.	This dissertation expands upon the control system process of identity theory by adding a measure of tightness of control of an identity to the theory. Control systems can vary in how tightly or loosely they monitor a standard (Powers 1973). In identity theory, the standard is the set of identity meanings to be compared with meanings being monitored in the situation. Individuals will vary in how tightly or loosely they maintain those identity standard meanings. A measure of tightness of control was developed by asking individuals about the various ways they define the self for the student identity dimension academic responsibility. Including tightness of control in the identity model will help researchers to better understand the identity control process because tightness of control is shown to influence how individuals experience discrepancies (what happens when feedback in the situation does not match one's identity meanings). 	Key findings indicate that tightness of control of an identity influences the identity control process with respect to emotional output. Individuals with more tightly controlled identities experience more negative emotion in the face of discrepancy than individuals with more loosely controlled identities. This suggests that individuals with tighter control systems are more bothered when their identities are challenged in situations. While it is likely that a more intense emotional response would lead to a greater behavioral response, this link has not yet been established empirically. Based on past control systems research (Powers 1973), individuals with more tightly controlled identities should be more effective at correcting a discrepancy than individuals with looser control systems. Findings in the present study indicate that individuals with more tightly controlled identity meanings will express greater adjustment in behaviors to fix a discrepancy than individuals with looser control systems. This suggests a tighter control system is more effective at correcting a disturbance than a more loosely controlled system. The implications of the findings of this study, its limitations and future research are discussed.

Cyborg Dreams in Asian American Transnationality: Transgression, Myth, Simulation, Coalition
By deploying a cyberculture theory of cyborg politics in my literary analyses of Asian American literature, I deconstruct Asian American subjectivity through the trope of transnationality. In the Asian American transnational, I locate four prominent traits of Donna Haraway's socialist feminist cyborg: boundary transgression, the recognition and re-scripting of myth, simulations of identity, and coalitions of affinity. By adopting the language of cyberculture, I envision Asian American literature as a technologized textual landscape where narrative becomes virtual narrative such that we draw away from the static nature of a representational politics of identity in order to formulate articulations on a simulational politics of identity. Brian Massumi advocates privileging simulations of identity because unlike representations of identity that cannot move into the realm of the virtual due to being entrenched within a static grid of immobile significations, simulations allow us to imagine mobile concepts like movement, affect and sensation in the discourse of culture and power. Recognizing the Asian American transnational's propensity to transgress boundaries just as readily as the cyborg, I examine the transnational's capacity to recognize, reveal, and contradict hegemonic constructs that sustain the mythology of coherent subjectivity, seamless national identity and the U.S. nation as the democratic ideal. The indeterminate nature of the Asian American transnational limns how the racially-marked Asian American body contradicts, exacerbates and exceeds the circumscriptions of U.S. national identity. In five Korean American novels, I investigate indeterminacy in Korean American narrative and subjectivity such that it demonstrates the Kandice Chuh's suggestion to deconstruct Asian American subjectivities in order to formulate a more subjectless discourse. By deconstructing a particularized identity such as Korean American identity, I deploy my investigation in a language specific enough to make significantly concrete arguments for deconstructing Asian American subjectivity overall. Finally, I demonstrate the efficacy and cogency in formulating a critical language of affect into the discourse of literary scholarship due to my conviction that affect is not only a crucial space where we might imagine an emergent liberatory politics but that affect is also a critical tool where such a politics of movement and change can indeed materialize.

Beyond folk psychology? : toward an enriched account of social understanding
Folk psychology is the ability to interpret people's mental states (beliefs, desires, etc.) and use this information to explain and predict their behavior. While folk psychology has traditionally been seen as fundamental to human social understanding, philosophers drawing on the phenomenological tradition have recently argued that most of our everyday social interactions do not involve folk psychology. I defend the role of folk psychology in human social understanding against these phenomenological critics. I argue that we need not abandon the folk psychological picture to heed the central claims of these phenomenological critics. In so doing, I develop an enriched account of human social understanding that accepts their descriptions of the phenomena of human social understanding while retaining a significant role for folk psychological reasoning at the subpersonal level. In chapter 1 I describe the traditional folk psychological account of social understanding and the challenge to it raised by these critics. Since it assumes folk psychology is pervasive, the traditional philosophical and empirical research on human social understanding focuses on the psychological processes by which we attribute mental states : whether we apply theoretical knowledge about human psychology, as proposed by the theory theory, and/or use own psychological mechanisms to "simulate" other people's mental states, as the simulation theory suggests. Two central claims made by the phenomenological critics against this traditional picture are: (i) that some mental state understanding occurs by "direct perception," without the need for theorizing or simulation; and (ii) that attributing beliefs and desires is not required and not often used for unreflectively interacting with other people. I argue that direct social perception and unreflective social interaction are phenomena that should be better emphasized in accounts of human social understanding, but which can be explained by folk psychological reasoning occurring at the subpersonal level, outside of conscious awareness. In chapters 2-3 I develop my conception of personal and subpersonal levels. I then apply this framework in the next two chapters to argue that direct social perception (chapter 4) and unreflective social interaction (chapter 5) can, contrary to the phenomenological critics, be driven by folk psychological theorizing and/or simulation

From International Idea to Domestic Policy: Explaining the Emergence of Same-Sex Partnership Recognition in Argentina and Brazil
This dissertation examines how the international idea of same-sex partnership recognition (SSPR) becomes enacted into domestic policy in Argentina and Brazil. It begins by looking at how the leading LGBT social movements in each country understand and prioritize the battle for same-sex unions. These understandings ultimately determine how far reaching an enacted law may go. Next, it explains what the current constitutional and statutory law is in each nation today and through which avenues it potentially could be changed. The second half of the work systematically compares how the LGBT social movement organizations have engaged with the three branches of government to advance their goals. What it finds is that Brazilian LGBT groups have long had elite allies within all three branches of government, but these leaders have not had the institutional capacity to affect change. In Argentina, on the other hand, all three branches have significant institutional powers to change the law, but lesbians and gays have had a harder time securing friends in these positions. The result is that movements in both countries have not yet achieved success. However, some recent changes in both of these southern cone nations have made SSPR a real possibility: the Brazilian Supreme Federal Court, with new and expanded powers, may soon decide in favor of stable unions for same-sex couples. Moreover, allies in the Argentine Senate are expected to soon approve a bill granting full same-sex marriage rights. The final chapter concludes with a brief look at how the variables identified in these cases function in three other Latin American countries.

Health and Rights at the Margins
In July, the International AIDS Conference drew more than twenty thousand participants. Held in Washington, D.C., it was the first since 1990 to convene in the U.S., because the U.S. recently lifted a ban that previously denied visas to HIV-positive persons. Still, the attendance of global participants was confined by another constraint of visa regulations: non-U.S.-citizen sex workers are still systematically denied visas. In protest, activists for the rights of sex workers, who typically take an active role in IAC activities, convened in Kolkata for an anti-conference, “Freedom Festival,” which celebrated the rights of sex workers and protested the marginalization of this community against the backdrop of the larger hegemonic movement to combat HIV/AIDS. During the anti-conference, alongside clear disdain for their exclusion from some parts of the HIV/AIDS movement, one of the loudest messages was a cry that sex worker rights are being infringed by the human trafficking movement (Sil 2012). The global concern around human trafficking has—in the name of prevention—increased the surveillance and policing of sex workers globally, making their work more precarious and frequently labeling it criminal. This contradiction propels my overarching question of how the HIV/AIDS and human trafficking movements are linked.

The Place of Kinship in the Social System: A Formal-and-Functional Consideration With an Appendix on Descent and Alliance
This papers examines the recent controversy as to whether there is any universally defined domain of kinship in sociocultural systems from the point of view of the philosophy of science, in particular, the classical positivism (e.g., of Radcliffe-Brown and of Murdock) that I show to have motivated the question.  It also examines the American version of the controversy, as with Schneider, and shows that, again, the question arises because of essentially the radical empiricism of cultural particularism and its methodological focus.  It then proceeds to evaluate the question from a cognitive-cum-formalist perspective, and goes on the argue that Lounsbury’s approach is not only also positivist-behaviorist in its foundations but also unwilling or unable to consider kinship as a domain having regard to its function within the whole social system and therewith in fact inadequately formalist, having regard to genealogical organization.  I proceed to take especial not of the fact that, uniquely, kinship is a system of social relations that is what I cal pure-relational, that being the functional basis of its universal definition.  Finally, as an appendix, I generalize the idea of alliance to the structural organization of all kinship systems.

Indigenous rights in the Peruvian Amazon : a new social movement
In 2008, President Alan García created a package of legal decrees that sought to expropriate indigenous land and sell it to international corporations as part of his neoliberal agenda. The social movement in the Peruvian Amazon quickly responded by claiming that the decrees breached indigenous rights, particularly the one to previous consultation, stipulated by The Declaration of Rights of Indigenous Peoples of 2007 and the International Labor Organization's Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention 169 of 1989, both ratified by the state. This thesis analyzes the complex social relations between the state and the social movement in the Amazon. The first chapter examines the social conditions under which a social movement in the Amazon was formed as well as how Amazonian indigenous leaders surfaced creating social organizations and producing a strategy based upon an indigenous identity. The second chapter explores the transitional period during the 1990s and early 2000s, in which a neoliberal shift intensified the exploitation of indigenous communities' land, while multiculturalism introduced international discourses used by the social movement to politicize their demands and achieve goals. Finally, the third chapter explores the conflict between the state's rhetoric of progress and development used to advance neoliberal policies, and the response of indigenous activists through their indigenous-rights strategy. Through this analysis, this study argues that a new indigenous movement has emerged in the Peruvian Amazon through a self-proclaimed indigenous identity, where indigenous activists are using international documents to politicize indigenous issues in the Amazon and challenge power relations, citizenship, and indigenous rights, creating new social interactions and shedding light on indigenous issues and the Amazon

Where Do People Walk? The Impacts of Urban Form on Travel Behavior and Neighborhood Livability
Intensified critiques of urban sprawl and its associated ecological and social impacts, have led to a broad movement - New Urbanism - that calls for incorporating the elements of compact urban form, mixed land uses, public spaces, and greater pedestrianization into the design of urban spaces. Proponents of this program argue that, among other benefits, increased pedestrian activity will reduce the adverse impacts of automobile travel, while stimulating greater public interaction and a higher quality of life overall. This dissertation evaluates the accuracy of these claims, using four case studies in the San Francisco Bay Area to examine the interactions of urban form with residents' travel behavior and use of their neighborhoods, and to develop models of walking frequency based upon these relationships.
      The research methodology integrates both qualitative and quantitative analytic approaches. It conducts analyses across a range of scales, from regional land use, demographic, and access data that are more typically associated with transportation policy studies, to fine-grained urban form and travel behavior characteristics at the block and parcel levels, that are generally addressed only in studies with a strong urban design of architectural emphasis.
      A detailed urban form survey evaluates the specific urban form characteristics of each case study neighborhood, in order to develop a hypothesized "walkability" spectrum for the four case studies based on urban form features. An extensive mail-back survey targets residents' travel behavior and use of local neighborhood, providing data that is linked to the analysis of urban form in each of the case studies.
      The results of these two surveys are integrated to determine the effect that variations in urban form have on the perceived walkability of neighborhoods, residents' use of their neighborhood centers, and ultimately, whether this affects their perceptions of the neighborhood's overall livability. A combination of univariate, bivariate, and multivariate statistical analyses are applied to develop predictive models of walking frequency as a function of neighborhood urban form.
      Research findings indicate that the walkability spectrum hypothesized for the four case studies based on urban form surveys, is confirmed by actual travel behavior and residents' perceptions of their neighborhood. Walking frequency models are influenced most highly by the variable of distance, but retain a residual neighborhood effect as well, which appears to correlate with the urban form variations related to walkability in the four case studies. Findings also suggest that some individuals self-select into neighborhoods due in art to the perception that they offer good pedestrian, bicycle, and transit amenities.

Cars, buses, and jobs: Welfare Participants and Employment Access in Los Angeles
Some studies suggest that, among other obstacles to employment, welfare participants face a spatial separation from jobs and other employment-related services. Using data on welfare participants, low-wage jobs, and public transit in Los Angeles County, this study examines the relative access that welfare participants have to employment opportunities. Our analysis shows that welfare participants' access to employment varies dramatically depending on their residential location and commute mode. Many welfare participants live in job-rich neighborhoods and are able to reach many jobs without difficulty by either car or public transit. However, other welfare participants live in job-poor neighborhoods where a reliance on public transit significantly reduces their access to employment. In these neighborhoods, long and unreliable commutes on public transit often severely limit their ability to find and reliably travel to and from work. Therefore, given the distinctly uneven patterns of employment opportunities in metropolitan areas, policies to address the transportation needs of welfare participants should be targeted to reflect the characteristics of the neighborhoods in which welfare participants live.

The nostalgia of change : a history of Mexican return migration to Acámbaro, Guanajuato, 1930-2006
This study examines the social, economic, and cultural changes that return migrants have brought to a town with a long history of emigration to the United States. It encompasses a history of return migration to Acámbaro from the onset of the Great Depression in 1929 through the era of Mexican President Vicente Fox (2006). I trace and juxtapose how return migration has changed the town's social, economic, and cultural landscape. Some of these new attributes include an increase in drug consumption, the development of Chicano-style gang culture among local youth, and the creation of a temporary middle class. I argue that the development of this new temporary middle class has existed since the Bracero period and that its presence has polarized the populace of towns like Acámbaro because of the introduction of new cultural values. While some view cultural change as invasive and disrespectful to local traditions, others view it as an opportunity to break away from traditional values, prompting further migration to the United States with tangible temptations of a better life. Whereas traditional immigration studies focus on the challenges and opportunities that immigration poses in the host country, I conclude that return migration is just as important. The immigrant experience cannot be fully understood if their return home is not given the attention it deserves

Moral Psychology is Relationship Regulation
Genuine moral disagreement exists and is widespread. To understand such disagreement, we must examine the basic kinds of social relationships people construct across cultures and the distinct moral obligations and prohibitions these relationships entail. In Chapter 2 of the dissertation, I develop Relationship Regulation Theory, which postulates that there are four fundamental and distinct moral motives embedded in different social-relational schemas. Unity is the motive to care for and support the integrity of in-groups by avoiding or eliminating threats of contamination, and providing aid and protection based on need or empathic compassion. Hierarchy is the motive to respect rank in social groups where superiors are entitled to deference and respect but must also lead, guide, direct, and protect subordinates. Equality is the motive for balanced, in-kind reciprocity, equal treatment, equal say, and equal opportunity. Proportionality is the motive for rewards and punishments to be proportionate to merit, benefits to be calibrated to contributions, and judgments to be based on a utilitarian calculus of costs and benefits. The four moral motives are universal, but cultures, ideologies, and individuals differ in when they activate these motives and how they implement them. Unlike existing theories (Haidt, 2007; Hauser, 2006; Turiel, 1983), Relationship Regulation Theory predicts that any action, including violence, unequal treatment, and "impure" acts, may be perceived as morally correct depending on the moral motive employed and how the relevant social relationship is construed. In Chapter 3, I report two experiments that I conducted to investigate whether activating social-relational schemas would lead to corresponding activation of moral motives. In Experiment 1, I found that framing a social group in terms of Communal Sharing or Authority Ranking social-relational schemas led to activation of Unity and Hierarchy motives, respectively. In Experiment 2, I found that priming Communal Sharing and Market Pricing Schemas led participants to allocate bonuses in a hypothetical vignette differently in ways that reflected the use of Unity and Proportionality motives, respectively. In Chapter 4, I incorporate notions of character into Relationship Regulation Theory. Specifically, I argue that moral judgments are partially based on evaluations of other people as prospects for social relationships. I use this relationship-based perspective of moral judgment to explain cases where an actor's intentions are neglected in observers' moral judgments of them.

Job Accessibility as a Performance Indicator: An Analysis of Trends and Their Social Policy Implications in the San Francisco Bay Area
Shifts in job accessibility reflect, in part, the degree to which land use and transportation decisions are helping to economize on commuting and promote social equality objectives.  This paper argues for the aggressive use of accessibility indicators as part of the long-range transportation planning process.  As a case example, changes in job accessibility indices are traced for the San Francisco Bay Area from 1980 to 1990, computed for 100 residential areas and the region’s 22 largest employment centers. The indices were refined based on occupational match indicators that weighed the consistency between residents’ employment roles and labor force occupational characteristics at workplaces.  The analysis revealed that peripheral areas tended to be the least job accessible.  Moreover, employment centers that are home to highly skilled professional workers were generally the most accessible when occupational matching is accounted for.  This was interpreted to reflect the existence of a more robust and responsive housing market in and around higher end employment centers. Our analyses also revealed that residents of low income, inner-city neighborhoods generally faced the greatest occupational mismatches.  Through a path analysis, racial discrimination was found to be a more serious obstacle to employment than job accessibility, however.  We conclude that the very purpose of tracking change sin accessibility is to provide feedback on the degree to which resource allocation decisions in the urban transportation field are helping to redress serious inequities in accessibility to jobs, medical facilities, and other important destinations.

Coercion, Responsibility, and Discourse
Coercion and conceptions of legitimate authority intersect with freedom and autonomy at both the individual level and the political level, and are central to two separate discourses in philosophy, namely, to discussions of free will and agency, and to social and political theory. However, with few exceptions, these discussions have gone on independently of one another. Traditionally, theories of agency have analyzed autonomy in terms of responsibility, such that an agent can be regarded as autonomous only if she is responsible for her actions. Social and political theory, on the other hand, is primarily concerned with how we may preserve our autonomy and freedom in the face of economic pressure and political authority, and has typically linked individual freedom to questions of human rights and political entitlements. I use the conception of responsibility that has been crucial to discussions of free will and agency to correct for the current over-emphasis on entitlements in social and political theory. I show how the concept of responsibility, rather than rights and entitlements, may provide a basis for freedom, by linking responsibility to discourse and discourse to freedom.

The Comparative Geographies of Servitude:  Servitude, Slavery, and Ideology in the 17th-and 18th-Century Anglo-American Atlantic
In this dissertation, I examine the ideological formation and geographical coalescence of colonial servitude in the literature of the 17th-and 18th-century Anglo-American Atlantic.  The figure of the colonial servant, typically consigned to a marginal literary position, embodies a fundamental dialectic illustrating the precarity of labor in the English Atlantic.  Its formulation is exemplified in Francis Bacon's 1606 address to James I on the planting of Ireland.  In this discourse, Bacon articulates colonial transportation as "a double commodity," a twin advantage and dual solution to the labor surpluses of England and Scotland and the characteristic labor shortages of the colonial plantations -- a simple but cutting design that links the "avoidance of people here" with the "making use of them there."  Rendered economic, social, and political liabilities at home, English and Scottish laborers are refigured as potential assets of colonial elsewheres.  It is a logic that will outlive the overpopulation crises of Elizabethan and Jacobean England and obtain as the basic model for transatlantic colonial servitude -- the condition assumed by over half of all migrants to the English colonies in the 17th and 18th centuries and one comprising indentured servants, convict transports, political prisoners, redemptioners, maids-for-wives, as well as spirited, or kidnapped, transports.  Presenting the colonial laborer as an object of use and exchange, Bacon's characterization of transportation as a twofold benefit highlights the commodity status of the colonial laborer and underscores the fundamental economic character of colonial servitude.  My principal effort is to demonstrate that this fundamental economism of colonial servitude is continued, if also ideologically refracted, in the literature of the Anlgo-American Atlantic, as evident in each of this study's literary geographies -- Inkle and Yarico's Barbados, Oroonoko's Surinam, and Defoe's Chesapeake.  Whether taking up the extensive, adaptive network of the Inkle and Yarico myth (1657-1833), Aphra Behn's Oroonoko (1688), or Daniel Defoe's Colonel Jack (1722), my central claim is that the literary colonial servant is a figure of human commodification that serves an important mediating function in the transition to colonial capitalism and the emergence of racial slavery in the Anglo-American Atlantic.

Cosmopolis Now: Urban Narratives in the Age of Global Migration
This dissertation looks at the growing diversity of the modern city and its impact on the way we think about culture and identity today. The city, as I argue, represents a cosmopolitan space of possibility where locals and non-locals can come together, interact, and create a new sense of community that is not defined by race, religion or nationality.   Thanks to the recent advances in telecommunications and transportation which are largely responsible for what we now call "globalization," cities have not only become central to the daily operations of global capital but also play host to a wider range of immigrants, who have transformed the way we "imagine" the city. Therefore, by centering on the dynamic between the urban and the global, I will look at a number of contemporary novels and films rooted in what can be described as the "migrant sensibility."   The writers and filmmakers discussed in this dissertation--which include Hanif Kureishi, Salman Rushdie, Joseph O'Neil, Chloe Aridjis, Teju Cole, Shin Dong-il, Shim Sang-guk, and Kim Dong-hyun--all deal with issues of transnational migration and its impact on the representation of urban life in cities such as London,New York, Berlin and Seoul, forcing us to redefine the age-old notion of cosmopolitanism and what it means to live "together in difference."

The Bessel-Plancherel theorem and applications
/Let G be a simple Lie Group with finite center, and let K \subset G be a maximal compact subgroup. We say that G is a Lie group of tube type if G/K is a hermitian symmetric space of tube type. For such a Lie group G, we can find a parabolic subgroup P=MAN, with given Langlands decomposition, such that N is abelian, and N admits a generic character with compact stabilizer. We will call any parabolic subgroup P satisfying this properties a Siegel parabolic. Let (pi, V) be an admissible, smooth, Fr\'echet representation of a Lie group of tube type G and let P \subset G be a Siegel parabolic subgroup. If chi is a generic character of N, let Wh_chi(V)=lambda : V longrightarrow mathbb{C} / lambda(pi(n)v)=chi(n)v} be the space of Bessel models of V. After describing the classification of all the simple Lie groups of tube type, we will give a characterization of the space of Bessel models of an induced representation. As a corollary of this characterization we obtain a multiplicity one theorem for the space of Bessel models of an irreducible representation of G. As an application of this results we calculate the Bessel-Plancherel measure of a Lie group of tube type, L²(N\G;chi), where chi is a generic character of N. Then we use Howe's theory of dual pairs to show that the Plancherel measure of the space L²(O(p-r,q- s)\O(p,q)) is the pullback, under the Theta lift, of the Bessel-Plancherel measure L²(N\Sp(m,\mathbb{R});chi), where m=r+s and chi is a generic character that depends on r and s

This thesis examines the relationship between Islamic empires and the peripheral areas of southern Jordan, focusing specifically on the relationship between the Islamic state and copper producers, with some attention also given to the ways in which the rulers of Islamic empires legitimated their power and the relationships between craft producing and local nomadic groups. After presenting the historical and archaeological background of the region, the site of Khirbat Nqeib Aseimer will be presented as a case study for these issues during the Middle Islamic (1000-1400 AD) period. A preliminary analysis of the survey pottery from the site will be discussed, as well as its implications for the dating of the site, and Khirbat Nqeib Aseimer will be placed in its regional and theoretical context to the extent that the currently available data allows

Topics on Hispanic Demography:  Foundations for the Demographic Analysis of the Hispanic Population in the United States
The objective of this dissertation is to evaluate the quality of the decennial Census through the use of Demographic Analysis (DA), which is a methodology that estimates population size by using data on births, deaths, in-migration, and out-migration. Using DA, the quality of the 2000 Census will be assessed by using estimates of Census undercount for children aged 0 - 9, as well as measures of relative undercount for the 1990 and 2000 Censuses for Hispanics of older ages. In cleaning the data that measure the components of the Hispanic population, the chapters of this dissertation address topics on the sociology of the Hispanic population. 	The first chapter critiques the measurement of the Hispanic population in general, arguing that the Census Bureau's use of Hispanic identifiers is politically charged and ambiguous. Logistic regression is used to demonstrate that the personal identification with the Hispanic ethnicity is affected by dynamics of assimilation, race, and social context. The second chapter argues that the quality of the 1990 Census was compromised by the political atmosphere in which the Census was embedded, while producing alternate estimates of emigration using algebraic models informed by recent research. The third chapter re-visits the Hispanic Mortality Paradox by accounting for its counter-explanations (i.e. death undercount and emigration). Using life tables, it will be shown that the existence of the Mortality Paradox largely depends on the assumptions that one makes regarding the quality of the data used, although it continues to hold when the most plausible data are used. Chapter four demonstrates that interethnic childbirth is largely influenced by a mother's race and ethnicity, although social factors such as education and the marriage market serve to "break down" ethnic divisions and stir the melting pot. Chapter five tests the success rates of a number of imputation methodologies for parental ethnicities and predicts the number of Hispanic births that have occurred throughout the 90s. Putting all these pieces together, the conclusion presents a range of estimates of undercount of Hispanic children aged 0 - 9, as well as relative undercount that compares the counts of the 1990 and 2000 Censuses.

Same-Sex Couples and Marriage: Model Legislation for Allowing Same-Sex Couples to Marry or All Couples to Form a Civil Union
A “Model Marriage Code” and a “Model Civil Union Code” will ensure greater consistency, predictability, and completeness among state laws offering protections to same-sex couples and their families. They also will reduce confusion when separate state rules governing same-sex and different-sex couples affect employers, businesses, government and other institutions.
      Currently, nineteen states and the District of Columbia offer same-sex couples either marriage or a non-marriage, alternative status – or both, providing legally recognized partnership options for more than 40 percent of the U.S. population and nearly 50 percent of same-sex couples. However, the limitations and inconsistency among state laws cause unnecessary confusion and vulnerability for couples and families whose rights are at stake. Likewise, the current state-law patchwork creates difficulties for businesses that face additional burdens due to the diverse proliferations of family law statuses for same-sex couples. Businesses across the country are impacted when employees have difficulties knowing the legal and financial consequences of a proposed job transfer.  In addition, variations in state insurance, taxation and other laws make employee benefit plans more complicated. State and municipal officials also encounter confusing questions due to the variations in nomenclature and corresponding rights and obligations of residents when the state uses different systems for same-sex and for different-sex couples.  When residents have a legal status conferred by another state, especially one with unfamiliar legal consequences, the questions can be still more complex.
      At present, eleven state legislatures could act to allow same-sex couples to marry. In seven more states, constitutional amendments preclude legislation opening marriage to same-sex couples but permit legislation framing an alternative system through which couples can access comprehensive protections and obligations under state law.

Inheriting the Homeland?  Intergenerational Transmission of Cross-Border Ties in Migrant Families
Theories of migrant transnationalism emphasize the enduring imprint of the pre-migration connections that the newcomers bring with them. But how do the children of migrants, raised in the parents’ adopted country develop ties to the parental home country? Using a structural equation model and data from a recent survey of adult immigrant offspring in Los Angeles, this paper shows that second generation cross-border activities are strongly affected by earlier experiences of and exposure to home country influences . Socialization in the parental household is powerful, transmitting distinct home country competencies, loyalties and ties, but not a coherent package of transnationalism. Our analysis of five measures of cross-border activities and loyalties among the grown children of migrants shows that transmission is specific to the social logic underlying the connection: activities rooted in family relationships such as remitting are transmitted differently than emotional attachments to the parent’s home country.

Do women represent women? : gender and policy in Argentina and Mexico
This work examines the link between descriptive representation and substantive representation: do female legislators, in sharing a common gender identity, promote public policies that improve women's rights and citizens' wellbeing? Mexico and Argentina are ideal case studies. Both countries have gender quota laws, compelling political parties to nominate thirty percent women to closed candidate lists. The countries vary, however, on the proportions of female legislators elected and on institutional support for gender policy. Mexico under- fills its quota, but formalizes women's representation through a Bicameral Commission on Equity and Gender. Argentina, by contrast, over-fills its quota, but lacks those institutional mechanisms that legitimate the development of gender policy. I use quantitative and qualitative data to compare female legislators' and male legislators' interventions throughout the policy process. This data includes an original dataset of bill introduction and bill passage, debate transcripts and policy proposals, over 50 interviews with male and female legislators in both countries, and case studies of successful reforms. I consider constituent demands, as expressed through public opinion, and whether these demands link to legislators' agenda setting initiatives. Next, I determine the frequency of bill introduction across policy areas, and compare this statistic to the frequency of legislative success. Finally, I analyze the implementation of successful policies, to evaluate whether or not material benefits reach female constituents. This dissertation is located at the intersection of the comparative politics literature on legislatures and policymaking, on the one hand, and women and politics, on the other. I find that female legislators, more than male legislators, advocate for policies dealing with health, minority rights, and women's rights; I further find that the vast majority of female legislators adopt progressive positions on women's roles and opportunities. Most importantly, I conclude that legislative institutions and practices--namely gender commissions and women's caucuses- -contribute significantly to whether or not the substantive representation of women unfolds

Jaraneros and Jarochas: The Meanings of Fandangos and Son Jarocho in Immigrant and Diasporic Performance
This paper analyses the different ways that two groups in the Los Angeles area use son jarocho, a musical practice from Veracruz, Mexico and the participatory values in a fandango, a communal gathering, to build community and to connect with their Mexican heritage. The first group is composed primarily of Mexican Americans and Chicanas/os who refer to themselves as jaraneros, or players of the main son jarocho instrument, the jarana. For the jaraneros, fandangos provide an opportunity for people to come together in a democratic setting in which the main tenets of neo-liberalism such as competition and privileging the individual over the community are eradicated. The jaraneros are also connected to the Zapatista movement and a global effort to re-examine and ultimately challenge the new world order and its modes of capitalism like free trade under NAFTA. The second group, the jarochas, is composed primarily of immigrants from Veracruz. For members of this group, playing son jarocho is about connecting with their traditions from their hometowns in Veracruz and building community with others from that part of Mexico. Using these two communities as my case studies, I demonstrate the different ways that diasporic and immigrant communities cultivate the practice of fandango and son jarocho in Los Angeles. I argue that the meaning each group has assigned to this practice is reflective of each one's respective relationships to the homeland, Mexico, and more specifically to Veracruz, where son jarocho originates.

Playing With Lives: Theatricality, Self-Staging, and the Problem of Agency in Renaissance English Revenge Tragedy
This project explores Renaissance revenge tragedy's conspicuous theatricality in light of the genre's primary concerns of personal transformation and the place of the self within an increasingly prescriptive society and cosmology. Specifically, its goal is to assert the essential dramaturgical role of theatricality in the early modern revenge play. Focusing primarily on the Kydian tradition of revenge begun with <italic>The Spanish Tragedy</italic> and continued in the work of William Shakespeare, John Marston, and Thomas Middleton, this study investigates the genre's treatment of subjectivity and how the characters' attempts at self-fashioning are mitigated&mdash;and at times, utterly thwarted&mdash;by the preexisting interpretive systems within which these characters move. This project argues that the revenger's turn to theatricality affords him a means of destabilizing those associations by interfering with the court's ability to identify, interpret, and classify effectively. In so doing, the revenger facilitates a transformation of self that will combat his original state of impotence and vulnerability, and ultimately, creates a fleeting opportunity in which he might appropriate those tools of political domination that had previously victimized him. The liberatory potential of such theatricalized agency is compromised, however, by its conspicuous exclusion of female subjects, who are either appropriated as spectacles to motivate masculine reprisal, or cast as monstrous agents whose grasp at revenge effectively robs them of their femininity. More generally, <italic>Playing With Lives</italic> explores how the genre's theatricality undermines essentialist notions of subjectivity, and through its metadramatic conventions, essentially stages spectatorship to foreground issues of signification and voyeuristic reception to speak to the broader issues of how the individual semiotically constructs meaning and how those interpretations are situated within a political framework.

El náhuatl en Los Ángeles: el papel de la lengua indígena en la creación de la identidad chicana
Náhuatl, although the most widely spoken indigenous language in Mexico, is not spoken by indigenous immigrant communities in Los Angeles as are other languages such as zapotec or mixtec.  Rather, it is used by Chicanos, those individuals of Mexican descent living in the United States who seek to recover or preserve their indigenous heritage, in their efforts to create a unique ethnic identity.  The present work seeks to understand the role of náhuatl in the creation of Chicano identity. 
      The paper begins with a brief description of the linguistic situation of náhuatl in Mexico.  This is followed by an explanation of the relevant terminology and then a description of the methodology used to collect the data on which the analysis is based.  Information was collected from interviews with two náhautl instructors who represent different ideologies as well as from observations of a náhuatl workshop and a danza azteca rehearsal. The analysis itself consists of an overview of Chicano ideology in general and a description of the two main ideological groups to which Chicanos can belong based on their perspective of Aztec culture.  Furthermore, it describes the specifc linguistic attitudes and behaviors that are direct reflexes of the ideologies peviously presented.  The analysis is followed by a brief discussion of the linguistic situation of the Chicanos who live in Los Angeles, and the paper concludes with an examination of the effects that this situation have on the maintenance and/or loss of the náhuatl language.

Managing the (Post)Colonial : race, gender and sexuality in literary texts of the Philippine Commonwealth
"Managing the (Post)Colonial" investigates a range of literary texts - from American newspaper articles to Philippine state-sponsored poetry - which circulated just before and during the Philippine Commonwealth period (1934 -1946), when the islands were neither an official U.S. colony nor an independent nation. I argue therefore that the Commonwealth period was an ambiguous and contradictory political moment which I signify through the parenthetical use of "post" in "(post)colonial." I thus call into question whether or not an entire nation and its subjects could be simultaneously colonial and yet not, for it is at the moment of seeming official separation from the U.S. that political, economic, cultural and social policies actually ensured U.S. hegemony under the guise of independence. Ultimately, I analyze cultural and literary texts of the period to show how sexualized and gendered representations of the Filipino subject were not only utilized in an attempt to reconcile this contradiction of the Commonwealth, but also to imagine alternative nationalisms and forms of social emancipation. In the first chapter, I focus on the patriarchal formulation of benevolent assimilation and on American journalist Katherine Mayo's 1925 book Islands of Fear. I argue that Mayo discursively enabled her own access to the masculine realm of imperial power by positing a theory of Anglo- Saxon racial superiority meant to overwrite the patriarchal hierarchy between genders. This chapter demonstrates the mutually constitutive yet simultaneously contradictory nature of the imperial systems of racialization, sexualization and gendering. I trace the lines of this argument further in the second chapter as I investigate the 1940 Commonwealth Literary Awards. As the formal structure of an independent nation was established, state-sanctioned cultural projects such as the Awards not only obfuscated but also enabled the persisting economic and political ties between the islands and the U.S. Such projects did so by cultivating a canon of Philippine writing in English that posited normative masculinist nationalism as the telos of American democratic tutelage. In the third chapter I focus on what I term the hypersexualization of Philippine independence and the (im)possibilities of queer moments of desire in Carlos Bulosan's prose and Josè Garcia Villa's poetry - the impossibility of asserting a normative Filipino American subject and the possibility of imagining an America that is in the heart. Focusing on the queer moments in Bulosan and Villa's texts, I trace how the relationships between race, gender and sexuality are not only inundated with power but are also productively contradictory, allowing one access to spaces and acts of freedom

How do you convince children that the "army', "terrorists" and the "police" can live together peacefully? : a peace communication assessment model
This dissertation is divided into three parts. In Part I, I describe the historically applied global uses of communication in an effort to intervene into political conflict. I delineate and classify these practices into seven models. Next, I critically review the capacity of each practice to successfully manage conflict, and recommend these become the subject of scholarly inquiry as part of a new communication subfield I term "Peace Communication". In Part II, I begin an assessment of a peace communication intervention case, designed according to what I refer to as the "Mediated Contact Effects Model". In Chapter 4, I conduct a concise production study in order to outline the encoding of the case I assessed, namely Israeli and Palestinian versions of the television program Sesame Street. These television programs were co- produced by Israeli, Palestinian, Jordanian and American teams, and together constitute a simultaneously closed, open, glocal and hybrid text. After describing the text's encoding, I describe the methodologies I employed to, in turn, be able to assess its decoding by Palestinian, Jewish-Israeli and Arab/Palestinian-Israeli 5- to 8-year old children. Each of these groups of children interprets the Israeli-Palestinian ethnopolitical conflict, which is framed by the wider Arab-Israeli interstate conflict, through the categorical frameworks that they currently structurally occupy. These categories are, respectively, stateless nation, statebearing nation, and state minority and, they in turn, frame each group's organizational representatives' narrative goals towards (resolving) "the conflict", within the wider context of the interstate- system. Their goals are justice, security, and equality, respectively. In my effort to assess these children's interpretation of the text, I conducted an audience reception analysis. In order to conduct this analysis, I employed a combination of methodologies. These included comparative, multi-sited ethnographic, audience reception analysis, cognitive development, childhood and conflict zone field methodologies. I combined these methodologies with peace education praxis and used a mixture of largely qualitative, and, to a lesser extent, quantitative methods to carry out the study. In Part III, I conduct the audience reception analysis. By including in it what I refer to as a "context analysis", I demonstrate how the respective categories of stateless nation, statebearing nation and state minority formed the schema through which the three separate audiences filtered their interpretations of the efforts of the Israeli and Palestinian Sesame Street text. Each audience accepted and negotiated the aspects of the text related to themselves and what I refer to as their "shared others" (e.g. Arab/ Palestinian-Israelis for both Jewish-Israelis and Palestinians), typically interpreting both to be in the text and to be good-natured human beings. However, they opposed it to the extent that, in many cases, they did not even "see" their "others", or primary partner to "the conflict" in the text. I.e. with respect to the latter, Palestinian children and Jewish-Israeli children tended to simply erase each other from the text. The former erased the latter because they did not decode from the text the presence of "armies" and the latter erased the former, in part, because they did not decode "terrorists". My findings shed light on the "normalcy" of life within zones of conflict. They describe how ethnopolitical conflicts are fundamentally rooted in limited and unequal forms of contact and help to explain the socialization processes at play that serve to make these and other political conflicts intractable. Moreover, they help to, in turn, trace precisely the reasons why the context of the conflict framing each of these children's lives led them to oppose the encoded mediated contact provided to them by the Israeli and Palestinian Sesame Street text. In light of their active decodings, in most instances, this peace communication intervention text ultimately suffered from difficulties in being able to potentially foster behavioral changes on the part of its audience members, particularly with respect to their "others", and, in turn, trying to either build or make peace. I conclude by recommending that mediated contact interventions encode both the structural and narrative contexts of their specific conflict into their design if they are to best stand a chance of effectively building and/or especially, of making peace

Urban Enceintes and Roman Identities: an Example from Toulouse
Working with a physical border, in fact a wall, Douglass Underwood examines the Romanization of Toulouse, through the imposition of civic structures. Using spatial theories, Underwood examines the ways in which the boundaries and borders themselves can even become markers of identity. The Roman identity of the city of Toulouse was imposed by Romans, and the city wall itself, far from being merely a defensive structure, served a more important purpose of sending a message of power. By forcing a Roman identity on the city of Toulouse, over time, it did indeed become a Roman city. This examination problematizes the use of archaeological data, and examines the ways in which people deal with imposed structures.

Raymond F. Dasmann : A Life in Conservation Biology
Not everyone seems to realize there is another vicious world war already underway--the war against the planet. It is an ecological war, and the weapons being used are more powerful everyday . . . When this war is finally won, the consequences will be as severe and irreversible as though we had fought a nuclear war."  --Raymond F. Dasmann
      
      
         Ray Dasmann innovated the lucid, non-political, and universally applicable idea of ecodevelopment . . . His impact on conservation thinking has been fundamental . . . So many eminent persons are credited with inventing new wheels, only to find that their predecessors were the originals. Ray is surely one of those, way ahead, even sometimes too far ahead, of his time. He has thought deeply, but written clearly, about the fundamentals of our relationships with, and dependency on nature."  -G. Carleton Ray
      Raymond F. Dasmann's life as a conservation biologist during a half-century embraced both groundbreaking fieldwork and the effort to delineate the concepts which are the intellectual scaffolding of modern ecology. His lifework was shaped by a passion for the natural world and the desire to solve the environmental problems which threaten the planet. Dasmann passed away in 2002.
      Dasmann studied at UC Berkeley under the legendary wildlife biologist A. Starker Leopold, and earned his Ph.D. in zoology in 1954. He began his academic career at Humboldt State University, where he was a professor of natural resources from 1954 until 1965. During the 1960s, he worked at the Conservation Foundation in Washington, D.C., as Director of International Programs and was also a consultant on the development of the 1969 Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment. In the 1970s he worked with UNESCO where he initiated the Man and the Biosphere program (MAB), an international research and conservation program, which is still ongoing. During the same period he was Senior Ecologist for the International Union for Conservation in Switzerland, initiating global conservation programs which earned him the highest honors awarded by the Wildlife Society and the Smithsonian Institution.He joined the faculty at UCSC in 1977 and was Professor of Ecology in the Environmental Studies Department there until he retired in 1989.
      Dasmann was one of the pioneers in developing the the conservation concepts of "eco-development," and "biological diversity," and identified the crucial importance of recognizing indigenous peoples and their cultures in efforts to conserve natural landscapes. These concepts over the last thirty years coalesced in American and international environmental thinking as "sustainable development," the key dynamic concept informing contemporary conservation efforts.
      The oral history volume documents the intellectual geneology of these ideas and their practical application in Dasmann's work; and his long association with some of the key American and global environmental organizations which emerged during the latter half of the 20th century.
      Dasmann published numerous scientific articles and books, including The Last Horizon (1963), The Destruction of California (1964), Planet in Peril? (1971), The Conservation Alternative (1973) and his classic textbook, Environmental Conservation (5th edition, 1984), all of which have had lasting influence in modern conservation thinking and policy-making. He was involved in many environmental organizations, including the Wildlife Society, World Conservation Union, Earth Island Institute, the Central California Coast Biosphere Reserve, the World Wildlife Fund. Raymond F. Dasmann's life as a conservation biologist during a half- century embraced both groundbreaking fieldwork and the effort to delineate the concepts which are the intellectual scaffolding of modern ecology. His lifework was shaped by a passion for the natural world and the desire to solve the environmental problems which threaten the planet.

[youth, black, rate, joblessness, percent, unemployment, white]

An Analysis of the Spatial Determinants and Long-Term Consequences of Youth Joblessness
One of the most pressing and pervasive problems facing contemporary American society concerns the alarmingly high rates of joblessness suffered by inner-city African-American youth. Rates of black youth unemployment and joblessness far exceed those of white youth. For the year 1995, the unemployment rate for black youth workers between 16 and 19 years of age was approximately 37 percent for young black men and 34 percent for young black women. Furthermore, the rate of joblessness stood at 75 percent for black male youth and 74 percent for black female youth. In contrast, the comparable unemployment rates for white male and white female youth were 15 and 13 percent, respectively, while the corresponding rates of joblessness were 49 and 48 percent.
      The relatively high rate of black youth joblessness raises several important questions concerning the causes and consequences of inner-city youth unemployment. Particularly, what explains the consistently large disparity between white and black youth unemployment rates? Is employment  discrimination to blame? Do black youth workers lack the skills or personal characteristics demanded by the employers of youth labor? Alternatively, are there systematic demand-side differences in the local labor markets faced by the average white and black youths? Moreover, can studying the determinants of inter-racial differences in youth unemployment provide partial explanations of the large inter-racial differences that exist for adult workers?

Feasibility Study of Social Media to Reduce Intimate Partner Violence Among Gay Men in Metro Atlanta, Georgia
Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is a major public health issue occurring in the United States and globally. While little is known in general about IPV, understanding about the prevalence of physical IPV among gay men is even more obscure. There is a clear disparity in violence research attention focused on this vulnerable segment of society. This cross-sectional survey study was conducted to examine the feasibility of enrolling 100 gay men from Atlanta into an IPV survey study. The survey was administered via Facebook. Ninety-nine usable surveys were collected. Chi-square tests reveal that minority ethnic status, illicit drug use, and non-disclosed orientation status were all significantly
      associated with positive IPV reports--in terms of both victimization as well as perpetration. Overall, the majority of the study sample indicated that they believe IPV is a health problem in the Atlanta gay community. These findings bear importance for the Atlanta gay community and public health professionals who must address this nearly invisible yet increasing public health issue.

Assured pasts or gambled futures : contrasting approaches to context in selected 20th century Mexican and Argentine art practices
This dissertation explores four Argentine and Mexican twentieth century art practices that mobilized the profile of the Latin American avant-garde at home and abroad by inscribing context, regionality, objectivity and the future in innovative and sharply contrasting ways : Diego Rivera and Gabriel Orozco in Mexico, and Tucumán Arde and Guillermo Kuitca in Argentina. Building on recent Latin American scholarship that has recovered aspects of the local avant-garde formerly relegated to canonic obscurity, the text explores the specific interest the artists had in context and the way they inscribed it in their work. Two diverging tendencies emerge. In one the ventures into exteriority allow the artists to intermingle with changing but constituted discourses and institutions and establish speculative, imprecise, suspensive counter terms in projected futures. In the other the ventures into exteriority allow the artists to register and inscribe as truth value circumscribed experiences of context that are not projected onto desired futures but made to fuel polysemy

Ushering in change : Evo Morales' election and the transformation of indigenous social movements
Social movements throughout Latin America continue to not only evolve, but also continue to gain important ground. A clear example is in Bolivia where indigenous social movements played an integral role in bringing to an end to the neoliberal experience and usher in a period of change- -a period brought the election of the country's first indigenous president, Evo Morales. These transformations, however, differ dramatically from social movements of the past. Social movements in the 21st century highlighted the importance ethnicity, while also addressing the gross social and economic inequalities that have stood the test of time. In this context, this study will examine the transformation of social movements from the 1952 Revolution to the neoliberal era where movements succeeded in toppling oppressive regimes--defining the change and course of their respective countries

Social Conflict Theory and Matthew’s Polemic against the Pharisees
Utilizing sociological theories about conflict and the formation and change of identity, Thomas C. Fraatz turns to biblical polemic in order to show the creation of boundaries within the early Christian community. When examining the interactions of social groups, Borderlands Theorists are prone to point out the ways in which people use rhetoric to characterize the Other. In his examination of the Gospel of Matthew, Fraatz engages heavily with the works of Borderlands scholars Daniel Boyarin and Thomas Sizgorich to describe how the author of Matthew was trying to link, through the deliberate construction of narratives, the persecution and death of Jesus at the hands of Pharisees with the persecution and supposed eventual death of his own community at the hands of a current Pharisaic community. By making this link explicit, Matthew also helps to construct and reinforce the border between these two social groups, and simultaneously changes the perceived definition of both sides.

Disability trajectories : disabled youths' identity development, negotiation of experience and expectation, and sense of agency during transition
How do youth with orthopedic impairments negotiate expectations and experiences as they transition from high school to college and from family-delivered supports to independence? And what in the earlier periods of their individual development/family life provides the context and frameworks for their negotiation of transition to adulthood? The primary goal of this study was to better understand the identity development of this subset of disabled youth. Data were collected through youth and parent interviews, focus groups, and participant observation at a local mentoring program for disabled youth, more specifically, youth with orthopedic impairments. The researcher's status as a disabled person provided the benefit of insider access. Several questions guided the research: What influences disabled youths' view of themselves? What discursive frameworks shape these views? How does the negotiation of physical and social barriers impact the relationships disabled youth develop? How do social barriers affect youths' development of agency? Findings suggest that conceptions of disability have strong influence on the way youth view themselves; common disability discourses relating to normalcy and independence make claiming disability identity difficult; physical and social barriers require youth to use unique strategies in the development of relationships; and, disabled youth often do not find sufficient support in developing agency. Implications include incorporating critical disability studies into teacher education and in K-12 curriculum (and not isolated to special education contexts), recognizing bias and examining efforts to enforce norms, fostering classroom practices that promote seeing capability and support agency, and establishing strong mentorship relationships between disabled adults and youth

Conjuring Freedom: Reconstructions and Revisions of Neo-Slave Narratives
My dissertation argues for a revisionist periodization of neo-slave literature as well as a reorientation away from a US-based literary history that has been dominated by the mode of realism and toward a more comparative view defined by the geography, history, and aesthetics of the Caribbean. The canon of slave narratives was first dominated by the assumption both of narrative as the major and sometimes only genre of slave writing and of a linear temporality emplotting the journey from slavery to an attenuated freedom. In contrast, most twentieth-century neo-slave narratives rethink the genre from the twin standpoints of temporality and narratology: how both the "neo" and "narrative" descriptors have produced an entrenched and unnecessarily restrictive view of this evolving archive.	Chapter One places Arna Bontemps' Black Thunder (1936) at the headwaters of a new transnational neo-slave canon.  In Bontemps' complex depictions of revolt and gender and in his construction of a past and predictive temporalities, he revises the paradigm of freedom both ontologically and corporeally.  Octavia Butler's Kindred (1979) and Assata Shakur's Assata (1985) comprise Chapter Two, highlighting how the enslaved and imprisoned black woman's body becomes a cultural text on which we read symbolic, discursive, and narratological traces derived from slavery.  Chapter 3 argues comparatively that two poetic works, the well-known Aimé Césaire's Notebooks of a Return to the Native Land (1943)  and Ed Roberson's less familiar Aerialist Narratives (1994), revisit the complexities of slave experience by focusing on metaphorical transformations of the slave body.  In the final chapter, Gloria Naylor's Mama Day (1992) and Ishmael Reed's Mumbo Jumbo (1972) are paired in their differing attempt to transcend W.E.B. Du Bois' theory of "second slavery," as each author underscores how multiple slavery-derived pasts travel and collide in the present.  In comparing these diverse grouping of texts via their neo-slave topoi, I demonstrate how this emerging canon provides a space for new thinking on comparative slaveries and comparative freedoms to emerge.

The Relationship between Direct-Care Staff's Competence in Social Interaction and Behavioral Symptoms in Korean-American Nursing Home Residents with Dementia
The purpose of this study was to explore and describe the relationship between the social interaction competence of non-Korean direct-care staff members and Korean American older adults exhibiting behavioral symptoms of dementia (BSDs) who reside in an ethnically specific nursing home. A pilot study was completed to evaluate the feasibility, usability, content validity, and inter-rater reliability of two social interaction-coding schemas, a dementia competence coding schema and a culturally competent coding schema, developed by the principal investigator.In general, there was a negative trend between direct-care staff's dementia competence in social interaction and BSDs that interacted with their level of cultural competence in social interaction. These results suggest that both dementia competent and culturally competent social interactions influence BSDs, although there were morning and afternoon differences. The results provide a foundation that may lead to the development of culturally appropriate and supportive interventions for ethnic minority older adults, as a starting point to improve dementia care for ethnic minority nursing home residents. Implications and recommendations for further studies are presented.

La Siguanaba haunts with bravery and doubts : second-generation Salvadoran women
This ethnography applies the monstrosity and power of La Siguanaba as a methodological and epistemological tool to map the development and politicization of Salvadoran transnational identity as experienced by three second- generation women who grew up in Los Angeles County, attend the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), and are members of a Salvadoran based student organization. There are two main focal points featured in the text. Firstly, I posit that the process of forced racial formation endured within the United States is one of the factors inciting the particular kind of discourse about Salvadoran-ness among these second-generation women. It is a racial formation based on exclusion from mainstream U.S. society, especially as inhabitants of ghettos and barrios. This exclusion is positioned against what these women experience as the idea of inclusion in a Salvadoran homeland and nation. For these women, Salvadoran identity becomes about mediating diasporic displacement from El Salvador with the realities of local contexts. Secondly, I address the transformation of the title researcher through the activity of concurrently Being ethnographer and subject of study. As a self-identified Salvadoran women, the formal interviews and multiple informal interactions between myself and the three women developed into a complex reciprocal process of discussing issues and theories related to Salvadoran transnational identity and simultaneously conceptualizing that identity through praxis. The integration of researcher and researched into one became an important beginning point to expand the boundaries of ethnography. It allowed the possibility to think of ethnography as also being a form of action research. More significantly, in this case, it allowed for the opportunity to think of doing ethnographic action research by, from and for the margins. This implies that the knowledge produced as part of this ethnography may hold value not only to an academic institution but also to the community of inquiry

[streets, attention]

Great Streets
Streets are more than public utilities, more than mere traffic conduits, more than the equivalent of water lines and sewers and electric cables, more than linear physical spaces that permit people and goods to get from here to here. To be sure, communication remains a major purpose, along with unfettered public access to property. These roles have received abundant attention, particularly in the latter half of the twentieth century. Other roles have not. 
      Streets shape the form and comfort of urban communities. Their sizes and arrangements give or deny light and shade. THey may focus attention and activities on one or many centers, at the edges, along a line, or they may simply direct one's attention to nothing in particular. The three streets that lead from the Piazza del Popolo in Rome, Via del Corso in the center give focus to that city as does nothing else. So does Market Street in San Francisco and a hundred Main Streets in small cities across the United States.

Racial and Ethnic Variations in Employment Access: An Examination of Residential Location and Commuting in Metropolitan Areas
This paper uses data from the metropolitan samples of the American Housing Survey in 1977/78 and 1985 to examine the commute patterns of whites, blacks, and Hispanics in metropolitan areas, with a particular focus on the commutes of workers living in predominately minority residential areas. Contrary to the spatial mismatch hypothesis, black and Hispanic workers living in minority areas had both shorter commutes and commutes that increased more slowly between 1977/78 and 1985 compared to workers in other areas. Further, a longitudinal analysis shows that the average commute times of non-moving minority workers in predominately minority areas decreased during the study period. Much of the observed differences in commute time between whites, blacks, and Hispanics are explained by variations in commute mode; white workers are more likely to drive to work alone while minority workers are more likely use public transit. We find this "automobile mismatch" between white and minority workers to be a much more important factor in explaining racial/ethnic variations in commuting than a spatial mismatch between minority workers and suburban employment.

Without reservations : native hip hop and identity in the music of W.O.R.
This dissertation focuses on how the Native hip hop group WithOut Rezervation (W.O.R.) incorporates hip hop both as genre and culture, to construct a contemporary sense of identity. Through a critical review of contemporary Native identity within hip hop culture, this dissertation will illustrate that there exists a point of dialogue between the Native and non-Native communities. Taking into account the cultural and political histories of the forced diaspora of Native people into the urban centers, this dissertation will examine the persistent identity and (mis -)representation of Native people within hip hop history through the integration of the sample Apache. A deconstruction and re-construction of the pluralities present within contemporary Native identity is articulated through the development of three identity formations, tribal, inter-tribal, and multi-tribal. This dissertation addresses how W.O.R. re-presents and expresses the socio- political issues of stereotype, gender, oral traditions, and contemporary identity negotiation in the lyrics, rhythm, and hip hop techniques of sampling and scratchinʼ. This dissertation serves to the benefit of the large Native and non-Native intellectual communities by presenting a contemporary understanding of the expressive cultures present within the genre of Native hip hop. Further, this dissertation seeks to serve as a critical model that permits the expansion, development, and further investigation of other Native musics

Inhalation of motor vehicle emissions: effects of urban population and land area
Urban population density may influence transportation demand, e.g., as expressed through average daily vehicle-kilometers traveled in private motor vehicles per capita. In turn, changes in transportation demand influence total passenger vehicle emissions to which populations are exposed. Population density can also influence the fraction of total emissions that are inhaled by the exposed urban population. Equations are presented that describe these relationships for an idealized representation of an urban area. Using analytic solutions to these equations, we investigate the effect of three changes in urban population and urban land area (infill, sprawl, and constant-density growth) on per capita inhalation intake of primary pollutants from passenger vehicles. For the system considered, the magnitude of these effects depends on density–emissions elasticity (εe); a normalized derivative relating change in population density to change in vehicle emissions. For example, based on the idealized representation of the emissions-to-intake relationship presented herein, if urban population increases, then per capita intake is less with infill development than with constant density growth if εe is   -0.5, the reverse is true.

Slavery and Servitude
While various forms of coercion to labor and restriction of individual freedom did exist throughoutEgyptian history, slavery is rather defined by economic than by legal indicators. Some literary textspresent figures of slaves, called Hm (“laborer”) or bAk (“servant”). The documentary evidence ismultifaceted: during the Old Kingdom, very large segments of the population were drawn to corvéework, exemption for religious service and even upward mobility being possible, while foreignprisoners of war were clearly enslaved (sqr-anx). With the emergence of new social elites, Egyptiantexts from the early Middle Kingdom onward display a more distinct consciousness of the differencebetween “free” people, even if at the lower level of the social ladder (nDs), and “servants” (Hm,bAk), conscripts (Hsb), and fugitives (tSj), true slavery being presumably confined to foreignprisoners. The New Kingdom, with its relentless military operations, is the epoch of large-scaleforeign slavery, but also of local—owned or rented—servitude, both of which had becomeeconomically indispensable, adoption of a slave being a common practice leading to “free” status(nmHj). During the first millennium BCE, references to slavery become rare and are superseded byvarious forms of voluntary servitude caused by economic dearth or religious commitment. “Slavery”in the legal, inherited sense of the term unfolds in Egypt during the Hellenistic Period and is basedon capture in war, on purchase in the slave market, and on the enslavement of debtors.

Migration in the contemporary era of globalization in film : the effect of mobile and variable spaces on migrants in the European Union
Studying films that focus on migration to and within the European Union (EU) in our most recent era of globalization reveals a web of neocolonial relations that render geographical space both mobile and variable for migrant subjects and points to the problematics of disregarding spatial identities as significant determinants of migrants' subject positions. This Thesis examines four films: Stephen Frears' Dirty Pretty Things (2006) in comparison to Anthony Minghella's Breaking and Entering (2008) and León de Aranoa's Princesas (2005) in comparison to Icíar Bollaín's Flores de Otro Mundo (1999). I argue that a comparative analysis of these film pairs reveals that in order to effectively and productively theorize contemporary migrant subjects within the EU, we must attend to various subjects' unique subject positions with regard to race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality, and citizenship status, as well as to the dynamics of the geopolitical relations between the countries of emigration and immigration

Public Transit and the Spatial Distribution of Minority Employment: Evidence from a Natural Experiment
A recent expansion of the San Francisco Bay Area’s heavy rail system represents an exogenous change in the accessibility of inner-city minority communities to a concentrated suburban employment center. We evaluate this natural experiment by conducting a two-wave longitudinal survey of firms, with the first wave of interviews conducted immediately before the opening of service, and the second wave approximately a year later. Within-firm changes in the propensity to hire minority workers for firms near the station were compared with those located farther away. Also estimated was the effect of employer distance to the new stations on changes in propensity to hire minorities. Results indicate a sizable increase in the hiring of Latinos near the new stations, but little evidence of an effect on black hiring rates.

[sexual, female, behavior, arh, receptivity, er, membrane, receptor, protein, signaling]

Molecular Aspects of the Regulation of Female Sexual Behavior
The regulation of female sexual receptivity by estradiol is complex and requires both the classical nuclear receptors and membrane estrogen receptors.  It is only through the combined actions of both of these types of receptors in the brain and peripheral tissues that the female is ready for sexual behavior.  The nuclear receptors dimerize, bind to DNA and regulate transcription, and thereby the translation of new proteins.  The membrane estrogen receptors exert their effects through another method.  In the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH), hippocampus and striatum, estrogen receptor-&alpha; (ER&alpha;), the only estrogen receptor shown to be required for sexual receptivity, transactivates metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in order to initiate G protein signaling.  This leads to the phosphorylation of a diverse array of signaling molecules depending upon which mGluR is activated.  In a membrane to nucleus signaling schema, membrane-initiated estradiol signaling can lead to the activation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), which also in turn affects transcription.   For the activation of sexual receptivity, the association of ER&alpha; with mGluR1a, leading to the phosphorylation of PKC&theta;, is required in the ARH.  In the present set of experiments, I show that three other events within the ARH are necessary for sexual receptivity: caveolin-1 (CAV1) mediated ER&alpha; trafficking, spinogenesis, and modulation of activity regulated cytoskeleton associated protein (Arc).Estradiol regulates levels of membrane ER&alpha; modulating its own signaling, and CAV1 is a scaffold protein that traffics receptors to the membrane.  In vitro, it has been observed to move ER&alpha; and the ER&alpha;-mGluR1 complex to the membrane. Without this protein, signaling in these neurons was significantly attenuated.  Until now, no work had been done to examine whether CAV1-mediated ER&alpha; trafficking is involved in the activation of sexual receptivity in vivo. siRNA directed against CAV1 was used to  knock down CAV1 protein in the ARH.  This led to a significant reduction in membrane ER&alpha;, circuit activation and sexual receptivity.Estradiol-mediated spinogenesis has been seen in several areas of the brain related to sexual receptivity including the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), which is considered the final common output from the limbic-hypothalamic lordosis behavior regulating module.  Increases in dendritic spine density in the VMH and ARH have been proposed to regulate this behavior, but there has been no formal test of the idea. I induced the formation of spines in the ARH with estradiol and showed that this was mediated by membrane-initiated signaling requiring mGluR1a and the phosphorylation of cofilin. Deactivation of this natural actin depolymerizing agent allows the formation of new spines. I then used the &beta;-actin polymerization inhibitor, cytochalasin D, to inhibit spinogenesis in the ARH.  The loss of estradiol-induced dendritic spines markedly reduced lordosis behavior underlying the importance of morphological changes in the ARH for the estradiol-induction of sexual receptivity.  Mating experience has been shown to upregulate the immediate early genes in areas relevant to lordosis behavior like the VMH.  Mating is a rich sensory experience involving tactile, olfactory, and auditory stimulation, which seems likely to modify the circuits that regulate it. I hypothesized that the activation of immediate early genes may modify future sexual behavior. To this end, I examined differences between sexual experienced females that were allowed a mating test after each injection of estradiol and sexually naïve females that were behaviorally tested once, but were given a similar number of estradiol injections as the experienced females.  Unexpectedly, experienced rats were less receptive than the naïve females, even though they had more dendritic spines. The immediate early gene Arc was upregulated by the first sexual encounter and may play a role in the reduction of levels of membrane ER&alpha; in the ARH in experienced animals.  When the Arc upregulation was inhibited with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, receptivity in experienced females resembled that in naïve rats. These experiments indicate a vital role for Arc in the estradiol-regulation of sexual behavior.In summary, the regulation of sexual behavior in females is complex and requires the coordination of a multitude of molecular targets.  The trafficking of the ER&alpha; to the membrane by CAV1 allows for the initiation of estradiol-mediated spinogenesis.  During sexual behavior, the circuit that regulates receptivity is further modified by Arc.  When all of these molecular and morphological events are positively coordinated, a female will be sexual receptive.

Humans as predators and prey in ecological systems
The era in which we now live has been called the anthropocene (Steffen et al. 2007), suggesting that humans have become such a global force that we fundamentally alter global ecological interactions, the carbon and nitrogen cycles (Gruber and Galloway 2008), the ecology of infectious diseases (Daszak et al. 2000), and our own climate. Such anthropogenic disturbance is often seen as an external perturbation rather than as a part of ecological systems. I take the alternate view that humans are just another strongly interacting component within the larger community of species. By putting humans back into community ecology, I explore the impacts of human predation on wildlife, and the consequences of predator community restructuring on human disease.In some cases, management actions informed by science can mitigate or reverse negative anthropogenic environmental impacts. For example, the scientific discovery of the ozone hole (Solomon 1988) led to international action to regulate ozone depleting chemicals. It is my goal as a scientist to provide fundamental ecological insight that can inform management. As a result, this work is broken into three policy-relevant research themes. The first research theme quantifies the impact of varying levels of human predation of pacific salmon on ecosystems. The second theme addresses how changes in predator communities influenced the emergence of Lyme disease and other tick-borne pathogens that `prey' on humans. The third research theme addresses the need to understand the impact of human predation on large primates in tropical forests.

The Global War on Terror: Race, Gender, and Empire After 9/11
This research examines the ways in which race, gender, and capital structure the "War on Terror" by systematically unpacking the connections, and contradictions, in both the global and domestic arenas of US politics and representation of Muslims.  The War on Terror is the most privatized war in the history of the US, which provides an important site of analysis to explore the burgeoning industry created and sustained by fear of terrorism.  The scapegoating of Muslims as suspected terrorists allows for the uninhibited development and justification for the increasingly privatized Homeland Security State.  This research draws upon both the lived experiences of 60 young adult Muslims in Los Angeles along with extensive archival data on Muslim discrimination, to provide a comprehensive overview of the racialized and gendered processes shaping the representation, oppression, and emergent identities of the Muslim diaspora.  I situate their experiences within the context of three central dimensions of the War on Terror; state practices and policies, public discrimination and hate crimes, and ideological representations.  My research further juxtaposes the imperial deployment of women's rights discourses in justifying the "War on Terror" abroad alongside the widespread infringement on Muslim women's civil liberties in the US diaspora.  While Arab and Muslim American communities have been frequent targets of repression, I argue that gender significantly structures the post-9/11 backlash in qualitatively different ways for men and women.  That is, Muslim men have been characterized as dangerous, violent, and highly suspect within the popular imaginary and much of Western media, which has lead to the sanctioning of civil and human rights violations, largely through detainment, deportation, and surveillance.  In contrast, Muslim women are consistently portrayed as voiceless victims without agency, further invisibilizing their own lived experiences of systemic discrimination as well as the ways in which diasporic Muslim women navigate and resist such structures of exclusion.

Playing and Passing: Expressions of Identity and the Destabilization of Gender Construction
In this dissertation, I demonstrate that non-traditional gender expression by women has significantly developed and expanded ranges of acceptable gender performance for all people. The gender deviancy these women communicate functions not only to promote gender fluidity but to undermine compliance with constructed images of originality.     "Playing and Passing: Expressions of Identity and the Destabilization of Gender Construction" addresses women who resist gender conformity. Notions of how women should express gender, either in deference to or in rebellion against the social construct, work against the free production of gender identity. In the first five chapters of this dissertation, I use literature to examine butch/femme identities, bois, female-to-male transsexuals, transgender, and other less traditional genderqueers. I look at both mandates about the rights to gender and the ways lesbian and genderqueer women have confronted and subverted the heterosexual construction of gender. In the sixth and final chapter, I analyze the non-fictional space of the Michigan Women's Music Festival thus showing the real-world applicability of my analyses.      My broader goal is to show how gender rebels in all of their forms ultimately work to liberate all people from restrictive formulas for behavior and identity. Both inside and outside of queer culture, lesbians rail against the social restrictions that disallow the celebration of the female body in all its options of gender presentation, from high femme to stone butch, from androgyny to versatile gender dynamism. Ultimately, I highlight the past, the progress, and the goals of women working to emancipate gender and to disrupt the congruency of biological sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation as a fundamental truth.

The sociogenesis of idiocultures
This research explores the ways small group cultures are created and common understandings among previously unacquainted individuals are achieved. The genesis of culture is conceptualized here as a collective narrative process - a creative meaning-making endeavor that entails ongoing negotiation and adaptation, affective investment, the synchronization of previously learned systems of symbols and practices, the development of hybrid and new practices, and the formation and definition of group boundaries. Central to this work was the implementation of a research strategy, referred to as Romantic Science, which emphasizes the lived experiences of the participating observers, incorporating the researchers' "scientific knowing" with the feelings they have as they explore new areas of knowledge in relationship with others. These feelings are conceptualized, not as secondary or auxiliary forms of understanding, but as key elements of our cognitive and communication processes. A social simulation game, BaFa' BaFa', was adapted for use as a research tool that brought people together in meaningful relationships, provided them with legitimate roles inside a group activity where their actions had real consequences, and evoked the measure of affective investment that this paper argues is necessary for successful engagement in the genesis of small group cultures. Forty university students were engaged as ethnographic co-researchers for a period of ten weeks and immersed in simulated cultures in order to investigate cultural genesis in a systematic and theoretically informed manner, and to tell their story of cultural creation with the authority that comes from first-hand experience. This narrative report, which includes the ongoing interpretations of all participants, is the result of a meso-genetic approach to documentation and analysis

Ecological effects of an invasive social wasp on Hawaiian arthropod communities
The introduction of non-native organisms is a leading cause of species imperilment. Detailed studies of damaging invasive species contribute importantly to the development of effective strategies for conserving biodiversity. Among the many problematic invasive social insects, the western yellowjacket Vespula pensylvanica represents an emerging and harmful introduction. Because Hawaii lacks any native eusocial insects, the invasion of V. pensylvanica poses a potentially devastating threat to the native and largely endemic biota of this region. This study examines the underlying mechanisms of a social wasp invasion in Hawaii. Using ecological approaches and molecular methods, I quantify the effects of an invasive yellowjacket on native prey and competitors. This study identifies factors affecting invasion success, and contributes to the development of effective management strategies that minimize the ecological impacts of invasive social insects on native communities

"Telling Your Father That He's Wrong": The Politics of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights in Uganda
This dissertation project explores the question, "How and why have Uganda's population and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) policies failed to realize change despite clear, implementable policies, frameworks, and significant financial resources?" This project examines the extent to which population and SRHR is present in the policy environment and explores the political, environmental, cultural, and social factors that have facilitated and hindered political support for and implementation of SRHR policies and programs.The findings of this dissertation are drawn from qualitative analysis of primary and secondary data sources. Primary data sources include in-depth, semi-structured interviews with key respondents involved in policymaking and implementation in Uganda. Participant observation and secondary data analysis of relevant policies, reports, and related documents was also utilized.There are four key findings from this research project. First, implementation does not automatically flow from the existence of numerous policies. Rather, implementation of policies is dependent upon tangible political commitment through funding commensurate to need and through ensuring top-down accountability.Secondly, five factors (a critical juncture, a clear consensus, political incentive, collective action/social cohesion, and bureaucratic structure) played the largest role in Uganda's success in reducing HIV prevalence, as well as its failure to improve population and reproductive health indicators. Third, the wider macro-environment, policy characteristics, and policy formation are key factors preventing successful policy implementation for reproductive health commodities in Uganda. Policy implementation is clearly a political issue, and thus both academic literature and program-relevant research need to address specific political factors in implementation, rather than viewing implementation as a technical function of the state and NGOs.And finally, the findings of this dissertation challenge the good governance consensus and indicate that the "developmental patrimonialism" approach to governance may be a better fit for developing countries to move from extreme poverty to moderate poverty than the current "best practice approach". This dissertation argues that a "good enough" approach to governance that takes into account local context may be a better path to guiding country policies and the global approach to governance.

Teenage Employment and the Spatial Isolation of Minority and Poverty Households
Using micro data from the US Census, this paper tests the importance of the spatial isolation of minority and poverty households for youth employment in the largest US metropolitan areas. We first estimate a model relating youth employment probabilities to individual and family characteristics, race, and metropolitan location. We then investigate the determinants of the systematic differences in employment probabilities by race and metropolitan area. We find that a substantial fraction of differences in youth employment can be attributed to the isolation of minorities and poor households. Minority youth residing in cities in which minorities are more segregated or in which minorities have less contact with non-poor household have lower employment probabilities than otherwise identical youth living in similar but less segregated metropolitan areas. Simulations suggest that the magnitude of these spatial effects is not small. It may explain a substantial fraction of the existing differences in youth employment rates for white, black, and hispanic youth.

Women rewriting the nation : gendered violence in Colombian narratives (1950-2004)
This dissertation is an analysis of Colombian feminist novels inspired by three interrelated historical periods: the 1928 massacre of striking union workers on the Caribbean coast, the mid-century era known as La Violencia in which Liberals and Conservatives engaged in an unofficial civil-war played out in the nation's Andean region, and finally the Drug Wars of the 1980s which took place in Colombia's urban centers. My examination reveals how, throughout the course of the past six decades, Colombian female writers disengaged slowly from predominant literary productions by bringing attention to the types of violence that women have endured as a result of state-sponsored hostility. I argue that since the 1960s female novelists have been situated at the forefront of Colombia's literary production as they portray the specific challenges of women in a nation plagued by successive cycles of violence. More importantly, they bring attention to the specific types of violence that women have endured as a result of state-sponsored hostility: loss of shelter and stability, domestic abuse, savage gendered aggression such as the killing of pregnant women, and sexual violence including incest and exploitation in the form of prostitution. I argue that these feminist narrations expose how each new cycle of violence in Colombia is intertwined with previous generations of hostility, as well as the resultant tragic outcomes that women continue to face, including lack of access to land, education, protection, and security. In addition to its literary value, my project aims to further this collective effort of establishing commonalities between and amongst Latin American feminist narratives as they relate to history and culture. Using gender as a category of analysis, this project provides insight into how feminist novels on violence are inclined towards contesting patriarchal power structures in times of conflict. These cultural productions highlight how women challenge not only the limitations to their participation in the public sphere, but also their subordinate position within the national identity

An Empirical Analysis of Causality in the Relationship between Telecommuting and Residential and Job Relocation
Researchers have questioned whether the ability to telecommute is encouraging workers to relocate to more desirable residences farther from work, and in doing so, exacerbate sprawl and increase their net vehicle-miles traveled. The research presented here directly asks, is telecommuting a “friend or foe” of travel-reducing policies? Given that telecommuters tend to have longer commutes than non-telecommuters, is the ability to telecommute prompting workers to move farther away from work? Or, does the ability to telecommute allow those who for other reasons have already chosen, or would in any case choose, to live in more distant locations to commute less frequently? These questions are addressed using data collected from more than 200 State of California workers, including current, former, and non-telecommuters. The survey inquired retrospectively about their residential and job relocations, as well as their telecommuting engagements, over a ten-year period.
      The results indicate that, as expected, residential and job moves that are temporally associated with telecommuting episodes tend to increase commute time and length compared to other moves – though the evidence is not statistically significant. Analyzing the temporal order of telecommuting engagement and residential relocation, the data show that those who are telecommuting and then move actually tend to relocate closer to their workplace, whereas those who begin telecommuting following a residential relocation tended to have moved much farther from their workplace. For job relocations, the results differed slightly. Here, both key casual groups (those who are inferred to have their relocation caused by telecommuting and those who are inferred to have their telecommuting engagement caused by relocation) relocate, on average, to jobs farther from home. Analysis of the stated importance of telecommuting to specific residential relocations did not show a convincing effect toward more distant moves. Linear regression models of the change in one-way commute length following a residential relocation confirm that the beginning of a telecommuting engagement following the move is associated with increases in commute length, whereas engagement before the move is not. Thus, the evidence more strongly supports the positive view of telecommuting, that it is ameliorating the negative transportation impacts of moves that occur for other reasons.

The Intersection of  Trauma, Race and Gender  in the United States
This dissertation examines the effect of several different potentially traumatic experiences. The first study, using information from six years of the California Women's Health Survey (1999-2001, 2003-2005), examined the association between food insecurity and intimate partner violence (IPV) among a racially and ethnically heterogeneous population of women.  Findings showed that minority women had higher odds of both food insecurity and IPV when compared to White women. Moreover, a dose-response association was detected, with women reporting food insecurity without hunger having a 2 fold higher odds of  IPV and those reporting food insecurity with hunger having a nearly 5-fold higher odds of IPV when compared to women who were food secure.The second study, using information from the 2001 National Survey of American Life, assessed the association between a history of a potentially traumatic experience and mental distress in the previous 30 days among a population-based sample of African-Americans and Caribbean-born Blacks. I explored the modifying effect of both positive and negative forms of church-based social support on this association. The results indicated a positive association between a history of a potentially traumatic experience and mental distress as well as negative church-based social support and mental distress. A trend (p =.08) was detected when examining the modifying effect of negative church-based support.The last study examined the association between emotional and physical maltreatment in childhood and past-year alcohol dependence in adulthood in the 1995-1996 National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS). I examined whether this association differed by race/ethnicity and gender. Similar to previous research, I found that minority respondents reporting a race other than Black or White reported the highest prevalence of all forms of childhood maltreatment. The results indicated that men had higher odds of alcohol dependence and physical maltreatment when compared to women. Additionally, higher odds of alcohol dependence were found among men who reported emotional maltreatment in childhood as compared to men who did not experience any emotional maltreatment.

Exrending "Protection for Sale" with Heterogeneous Sectoral Political Organization
The Grossman and Helpman (1994) "Protection for Sale" literature as-sumes a binary sectoral political organization; lobbies do or do not exist for each industry. By extending the theory to encompass heterogeneity, I argue that sectors are politically organized to heterogeneous degrees.The "Protection for Sale" empirical papers use country-by-country idiosyncratic methods to determine the binary sectoral political organization. I use a consistent method based on Principal Component Analysis, valid for many countries, to generate the country-specific heterogeneous sectoral political organization vector. Using the "Trade, Production and Protection Database, 1976-2004" (Nicita and Olarreaga, 2006) covering one-hundred countries, a common set of trade-focused sectoral political organization characteristics are proposed.With this consistent methodology and the common set of characteristics, this new approach is applied to many Latin American countries, uncovering the intertemporal Government Weight on Population Welfare (GWPW) for each country. GWPW conveys the importance an incumbent government places on population welfare, and is shown to be highly correlated with the Trade Openness Index and key political and economic events for these countries. GWPW may be used by international development organizations to negotiate country-specific political and economic goals, and to potentially better measure progress.

Behavioral Effects in Financial Markets
We develop sentiment indexes to study the relationship between sentiment and stock returns. For the first index, we use only market return data; for the second, we use traditional indicators including the closed-end fund discount, NYSE share turnover, and the equity-share of new issues.  In sample we find that rising sentiment leads to rising returns and lower risk.  We also show that sentiment cycles lead bear markets.  In a forecasting exercise we develop two-stage model averaging (2SMA).  2SMA is a flexible framework that allows researchers to incorporate prior economic information into their forecasts.  Through 2SMA we develop two-stage Bayesian model averaging (2SBMA) and two-stage equal-weighted averaging (2SEWA).  With these techniques we forecast stock returns using investor sentiment.  We find that the 2SBMA and 2SEWA forecasts beat their traditional model-averaging counterparts and beat the benchmark random-walk plus drift in a statistically significant manner.

Can Boosting Minority Car-Ownership Rates Narrow Inter-Racial Employment Gaps?
In this paper, we assess whether boosting minority car-ownership rates would narrow inter-racial employment rate differentials. We pursue two empirical strategies. First, we explore whether the effect of auto ownership on the probability of being employed is greater for more segregated groups of workers. Exploiting the fact that African-Americans are considerably more segregated from whites than are Latinos, we estimate car-employment effects for blacks, Latinos, and whites and test whether these effects are largest for more segregated groups. Second, we use data at the level of the metropolitan area to test whether the car-employment effect for blacks relative to that for whites increases with the degree of black relative isolation from employment opportunities. We find the strongest car effects for blacks, followed by Latinos, and then whites. Moreover, this ordering is statistically significant. We also find that the relative car-employment effect for blacks is largest in metropolitan areas where the relative isolation of blacks from employment opportunities is the most severe. Our empirical estimates indicate that raising minority car-ownership rates to the white car ownership rate would eliminate 45 percent of the black-white employment rate differential and 17 percent of the comparable Latinbo-white differential.

Essays in Human Development and Public Policy
Despite strong recent economic growth, gender inequality remains a major concern for India. This dissertation examines the effectiveness of public policy in improving some important human development outcomes, with a focus on gender issues. The national Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostics Techniques (PNDT) Act of 1994, implemented in 1996, banned sex-selective abortions in the Indian states which hitherto had not legislated such a policy. Using village-level and town-level longitudinal data from the 1991 and 2001 censuses, along with household survey data from other sources, the first essay finds a significantly positive impact of the PNDT Act on the female-to-male juvenile sex ratio (number of females per 1000 males below the age of 6 years). Although researchers frequently mention the futility of the Act, this study is among the first to use a treatment-effect type analysis of the pre-ban and post-ban periods to show that the law hindered any further worsening of the gender imbalance in India. I find that in the possible absence of the PNDT Act, juvenile sex ratio would have declined by another 13-20 points on average. A second study evaluates the `unintended consequences' of the PNDT Act on child quality. Using household survey data from two time periods, and exploiting a natural experiment framework originating from the timing of the PNDT Act, I find a mixed impact of the law on gender-relative child quality outcomes. Since the PNDT Act partially improved the sex ratio but did not uniformly worsen the nutritional and immunization status of girls, it could be regarded as a truly welfare enhancing public policy. Finally, a third study examines the effectiveness of the Indian school feeding program in improving the nutritional and learning outcomes of children. Using a household fixed-effect and a propensity score matching framework, the outcomes of children receiving school meals are compared with that of similar children who are not covered under the program. The results show that the school meal program generally does not have any significant effect on the child nutrition nor learning outcomes, neither does it have any impact on the relative outcomes of the girl children.

Public Happiness as the Wealth of Nations: The Rise of Political Economy in Naples in a Comparative Perspective
The paper surveys the rise of political economy in eighteenth-century Naples in a comparative perspective. It presents several arguments: first, that far from being a passive receptor, Naples was  a producer of ideas about political economy that complemented other currents of thought in Europe; that the contribution of Antonio Genovesi was at the core of the intellectual  development in Naples; that the progress of science and arts in Naples did not constitute a sharp break with the past; and, finally,  that thinkers like Genovesi created a credible alternative  to both the Hobbesian view of human nature and the Scottish model of political economy associated with Adam Smith. Genovesi’s attention to how cooperation can be created to overcome collective-action dilemmas adds to our knowledge of the archeology of modern rational choice theory, while his emphasis on public happiness has been given renewed significance in light of recent recognition that increases in wealth do not necessarily produce individual happiness or life satisfaction.

The Performance of Chicano Masculinity in Lowrider Car Culture: The Erotic Triangle, Visual Sovereignty, and Rasquachismo
This project is a qualitative exploration of masculinity, race, sexuality, and identity found within the lowrider style of automobile customization. By employing the frameworks of homosociality, visual sovereignty, and rasquachismo, I map the terrain of Chicano masculinity as it is intertwined with car culture.  Using an insider perspective, I find that the production of identity in this arena is far more complex and nuanced than it appears on the surface.  The men discussed in this study produce their social location using mechanisms that often contradict commonly held assumptions about lowriding.  They have intricate strategies to appropriate and manipulate power while at the same time constructing gender and sexual identity that is quite common to hegemonic standards of heteronormativity.

Frank Barba, a Filipino resident of Aromas, California, was interviewed in 1977 by Meri Knaster, an editor at the Regional History Project, as part of a series of oral histories documenting local agricultural and ethnic history.
      Frank Barba was born in 1898 in San Nicolas, Ilocos Norte, northwest of Manila, on the largest of the Philippine islands. His family owned some land on which rice was cultivated by sharecroppers; another portion was reserved for home use. Barba received a high school education during the period when the Philippines were a U.S. possession. He learned English and some American history in a school with an American principal.Barba came to California in 1924 via a short stay in Hawaii, where he joined his aunt and uncle working in the sugar cane fields. After working briefly as a busboy in San Francisco, and as a night clerk in a Stockton hotel, Barba arrived in Watsonville in 1927 to take over the management of a Filipino labor camp that had already been established by his aunt Apolonia Dangzalan. Dangzalan's oral history is also published by the Regional History Project as part of this Agricultural History Project series.
      Barba worked as a labor contractor from 1927, at first independently, and then for the Birbeck Company of Aromas, which grew lettuce, string beans, broccoli, and sugar beets. When the company went out of business in 1967, Barba purchased from them the property he lived on, the original site of the labor camp.

[queer, violence, trans, chapter, death]

Queer Remains: Insurgent Feelings and the Aesthetics of Violence
Through an archive of court cases, prison interviews, morgue reports, film, and video, I argue that the promise of liberal democracy and the larger projects of humanism are built through the slaughter of other types of (non)sociality. Specifically, I attend to the murders of trans and queer people of color, histories of racialized violence, prisons, HIV/AIDS, and the animal industrial complex to knot together spaces of friction where non-mimetic histories might tell us something about one another. In other words, my project is not about substituting abject bodies, but shows how mechanisms of destruction are used and reused in the multiple projects of epistemic violence. To this end, I am interested in the ontological limits for those named as objects, under relentless force. Utilizing theories of the postcolonial, work in Black studies, feminist science studies, political and bioeconomies, and psychoanalysis, I argue that queer life is necessarily produced as the underside of gender normative, able bodied, white heterosexuality. Queer Remains is about the material remains of trans and queer people, the flesh and bones of those that once were, and also indexes the ways past violations haunt the present. The introduction, "The Afterlives of Social Death" opens with a reading of a closed circuit TV scene of Duanna Johnson, a black trans woman who was brutally beaten by Mississippi police while in custody in 2009. Here I situate my work, and its interventions, in various genealogies of Black, Queer, and Trans studies. The first chapter, "Queer Crypts: Overkill and Ontological Capture," thinks through an archive I assembled of murdered trans and queer people. I work through the gruesome horror of these murders to try to piece together a reading of violence that resists the "bad apple" model that popular LGBT politics argues. The true terror is not only in the pageantry of the murders, but the reality that they are not "outlaw practices," rather they constitute the norm of dominant culture. My second chapter, "Necrocapital: AIDS/Affective Accumulation/Viral Labor," argues that even within the biopolitical state, the reproduction of death is also a space of capitalist accumulation. The violence I highlight is the reality that the HIV cell lines are the alienated cell labor of a person living with HIV, and this labor produces drugs that the same laborer might not be able to afford. My third chapter, "Forced Life: Animality, Trans Captivity and Abolitionist Time," is an extended meditation on forms of "living" that might signify a space of (non)being more unthinkable than death. This chapter's materiality is the dual histories of the prison industrial complex and factory animal farming. Here I am interested in resituating abolition as a way of dislodging the work of humanism as the barometer of liberation. My conclusion, "Death Drops," offers a reading of a 14-year old gay youth's suicide letter, written before he hanged himself in 2010. While such acts are read to be pathological, Seth Walsh suggests in his note that he hopes by taking his own life, he will make those who bullied him "hurt like he hurts." Here I position the devastating act of queer suicide as a form of revolutionary violence and not only a "cry for help," but also a demand for action.

Constructing Family Among Same-sex Couples: A Comparative Study of Same-sex Latino and White Couples
ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATIONThis study examines the ways in which queer families construct "family" in light of social and legal constraints through a comparative study of fifteen queer Latinos and fifteen queer Anglos/whites  in self-identified committed relationships. I focus on three main aspects within the construction of "family" in everyday life: (1) familial acceptance for current relationships, (2) the social construction of queer or queer/Latino identity, and (3) the meanings of coupling, romantic commitment, and family practices and division of household labor.  Findings suggest that queer Latinos' cultural and familial expectations shape their perceptions of the "coming out" process and familial acceptance for their sexuality. However, fears and anxieties Latinos expressed over social and familial acceptance of their romantic and sexual lives were relatively similar to the stories told by the Anglo sample. Similarly, Latino respondents tended to conflate homophobia within Latino culture with Catholicism. Respondents in the Anglo sample told similar struggles with sexual identity and religious opposition. Furthermore, the everyday lives, household division of labor, and the way queer families construct "family" differ little by race/ethnicity. I argue that conceptions of a "traditional Latino family," "machismo," and other cultural perceptions of the Latino culture lead queer Latinos to believe they will not be accepted, that their familial acceptance process is more difficult than that of their Anglo counterparts, or that they may face greater opposition from their church or community--regardless of how similar their stories may be to these Anglo counterparts.

Abelian Subalgebras in Z2-graded Lie Algebras; Partitions, Young Diagrams and Ballot Numbers
The dissertation is broken into two parts. Part I deals with the following problem: suppose $\g = \g_0 \oplus \g_1$ is a simple $\Z_2$-graded Lie algebra and let $\mathfrak{b}_0$ be a fixed Borel subalgebra of $\g_0$; describe and enumerate the abelian $\mathfrak{b}_0$-stable subalgebras of $\g_1$. The original proof uses a geometric approach; in Part I, we utilize an algebraic method which better describes the corresponding subalgebras. Part II focuses on a generalization of a combinatorial problem related to the representation theory of affine Lie algebras; given an arbitrary partition, we describe an iterative algorithm which at every level generates a ballot number of partitions.

The political economy of labor market liberalization
This dissertation examines the role of policy tradeoffs in labor market liberalization. Countries with a rigid labor market and restrictive employment protection laws can raise the likelihood of liberalization by offering unemployment insurance as an alternative means of labor protection. Contrary to prevailing assumptions, employers are supportive of social welfare policies when doing so would help achieve a more flexible labor market--defined by the ease of hiring and firing--by ameliorating labor opposition through policy compensation. Moreover, the likelihood of labor market liberalization rises in times of labor weakness and waning power. Heightened market competition generated through increased economic openness, economic downturns, and financial crises negatively affect labor's bargaining power. On the other hand, democratization that enhances labor mobilization, protectionist policies that limit market competition, and favorable economic conditions that increase national wealth, all strengthen labor's bargaining power and thus its ability to resist liberalization. Thus, this dissertation examines the recent changes in employment protection laws in a sample of 84 countries in the world through a quantitative analysis (Chapter 2); in the middle -income countries in East Asia through a comparative case study (Chapter 3); and in the Republic of Korea through an in-depth historical-institutional case study (Chapter 4). The results of this empirical investigation provide strong support for the proposed theory

Lesbian Schoolworker Records
In 1978, Proposition 6 was presented on the California State ballot. This initiative, proposed by conservative legislator John Briggs as well as California Defend Our Children (CDOC), and later nicknamed the Briggs Initiative, rallied to ban gays and lesbians from teaching within the public school system. This later extended to possibly include any supporters of gays or lesbians as ‘advocates of homosexuality.’ A CDOC pamphlet in circulation at the time argued that the purpose of the initiative would not deny gays or lesbians their human rights, but instead “protect the rights of innocent children from people who choose their position as a teacher,” maintaining that “there is no inherent right for an individual to hold a teaching job.” was the Lesbian Schoolworkers Records, which contained information regarding its organizational history, principles of unity and structure, press releases, newsletters, flyers, paste-ups, and photographs. With a commitment to “fighting racism, sexism, class and oppression within our own movement and this society,” the Lesbian Schoolworkers organized in 1977 to defeat the Briggs Initiatives, Propositions 6 and 7. While this organization was among the many to rally against the anti-lesbian and gay bill, it was uniquely also actively campaigned against the anti-lesbian and pro-death penalty laws, and sought identify the relationship between Third World oppression and the oppression of all lesbians. Throughout the election fight,the Schoolworkers emphasized that the struggle against Proposition 6 was not a single campaign issue or just a fight for civil rights, but instead, “that we are all suffering at the hands of a common enemy.”

Plume Rise and Dispersion of Emissions from Low Level Buoyant Sources in Urban Areas
The projected increase in distributed power generation (DG) has given rise to the concerns on the air quality impact of small power plants located in urban areas. In order to estimate this impact, there is a need for a model that can treat plume rise and dispersion of a buoyant release in an inhomogeneous urban boundary layer whose structure is governed by complex surface characteristics.  Such a model requires three essential ingredients: 1) a realistic treatment of the interaction between the highly turbulent urban canopy layer and the turbulent plume spread, 2) a plume rise model that can accounts for the flow modifications caused by buildings, and 3) an appropriate estimate of the height of the nocturnal urban boundary layer.  Comprehensive laboratory and field studies were conducted to investigate each of these elements separately. Ground level concentrations (GLC) associated with a modeled DG were measured inside the water channel under different surrounding building geometries. Results from these measurements indicated that surrounding buildings induce vigorous vertical mixing which increase the near source GLC. Further investigations focused on the plume rise from these sources. The results from plume rise measurements suggested that plume exiting the DG stack can be significantly impacted by the flows induced by surrounding buildings. In addition to dispersion and plume rise measurements, a field study was conducted in Riverside, CA and the structure of the nocturnal urban boundary layer was investigated over three different nights. Results from these measurements helped us to develop a semi-empirical model that can predict the height of the stable boundary layer. Although we were able to reasonably understand and develop models to predict the micro-meteorology as well as plume rise and spread; we concluded that simple Gaussian dispersion models have limited performance in predicting the concentrations associated with urban sources due to the substantial complexity involved with the urban dispersion process.

Efficiency, Team building, and Spillover in a Public-goods Game
The notions of one’s social identity, group membership, and homophily have recentlybecome topics for economic theory and experiments. Yet, since people are members of manygroups (e.g., race, gender, handedness) what determines which identity or identities are the mostsalient in different environments? Further, how do these factors trade off against one’s financialinterest? We conduct public-goods experiments in which we permit endogenous group-formationand vary whether there is a team-building exercise and whether some people receive anendowment twice as much as others receive. We do see evidence that team identity affectsendogenous networks when there is only one endowment type; however, when both identities arepresent, high-endowment participants are strongly attracted to linking up with each other. Oneinteresting result is that the team-building exercise greatly increases the level of contributionwithout respect to whether one is linked to people from one’s team-building exercise.Apparently the positive feeling engendered by the group exercise spills over to participants whowere in another team; however, this is not the case when one group has been in a 4-person teamand the other four participants have not.

Colonial K'iche' in Comparison with Yucatec Maya: Language, Adaptation, and Intercultural Contact
In "Colonial K'iche' in Comparison with Yucatec Maya: Language, Adaptation, and Interethnic Contact," I examine K'iche' and Yucatec Maya language and literacy and its relationship to the development of indigenous social, religious, and political structures in the period from the 1540's, when indigenous literacy using Latin letters began, to 1825, the end of Spanish colonialism.  It focuses on how native peoples in Guatemala and southern Mexico were able to adapt Spanish imposed institutions according to ideologies of community structure from their common Mesoamerican culture. It reveals Spanish colonialism from an indigenous perspective and highlights the adaptive conservatism of native societies in Mesoamerica.K'iche' government provided protection from exploitation - the family protected its interests with the aide of chinamitales who protected them as their vassals from the indigenous governor and municipal council who protected the tinamit amaq' from colonial officials. The K'iche' people were the creators of the Popol Vuh, "The Book of the Mat," the mat being a symbol of marriage and the adjective "popol" a metaphor for an elite lineage. The family and its extended lineages were the basis for K'iche' and Yucatec Maya social structure.  Even though Spanish colonialism aggressively attempted to impose the Spaniards' preclusive religion the K'iche' adapted and grafted in Christianity to their inclusive religion.  Male town council members, indigenous lay religious leaders, and moiety leaders received a title, the q'a chuch q'ahaw, "our mothers, our fathers," which identified them as diviners and made them mediators between their communities and the outside world as well as mediators between their living charges and the community's ancestors.   K'iche' ideologies of land conjoined the concepts of their community's sacred space with the practical life-giving sustenance of the cornfield.  Elites protected the right to work it and allowed commoners usufruct rights and familial possession.  Community leaders made ritual processions to measure lands and marked off terrain with border markers, calling them by the name of individuals, families, saints, or chinamitales.  It identifies the adaptation of colonial K'iche' and Yucatec Mayan languages to Spanish and Nahuat. The K'iche' language in colonial texts is somewhere between "Modern" and "Classical" K'iche'.

Social learning in labor markets and in real estate brokerage
This dissertation presents three studies of social learning in economic decisions. In the first chapter, I present an analysis of social learning among home sellers as they select real estate agents to list their homes. We are able to identify this social effect by exploiting a natural experiment that arises from the manner in which members of the Mormon Church are assigned to congregations. We argue that the assignment to congregations is essentially random conditional on observed geography. Using real estate transaction data from the largest multiple listing service in Utah, we find that the average home seller is almost twice as likely to choose the same real estate agent as his neighbor if they are assigned to the same congregation. We also present evidence that some of the social learning in this setting is due to word-of-mouth communication and not simply observation, a distinction with important welfare considerations. We show that home sellers respond more to the real estate transaction outcomes of neighbors who reside in the same congregation than to the outcomes of similar neighbors in other congregations. In the second chapter, I investigate the hypothesis that informal job information networks exist among residential neighbors. Using data that includes information on the timing of residence and job transitions, I investigate whether correlation in workplace and residential location can be interpreted as evidence of social learning in neighborhoods about job opportunities. I find some evidence of a neighborhood peer effect in job choice that persists even in specifications in which reverse-causality can be ruled-out. However, I also find evidence of sorting across micro-neighborhoods on employment-related characteristics. In the third chapter, I present a simple model in which real estate transactions are more likely to feature high quality listing agents when selling agents are in a position to learn about the quality of listing agents prior to advising buyers. I test this prediction using multiple listing service data and county records data. I employ instrumental variables to identify the relationship between measures of listing agent quality and measures of the network connection between the two agents in the network of past transaction relationships

Can Transportation Strategies Help Meet the Welfare Challenge?
In 1995 nearly fourteen million Americans received welfare benefits, far too many in the eyes of the many critics of the program.  Developed originally to allow widowed or divorced women to stay at home with their children, the 1996 federal welfare reform package aimed to do just the opposite.  The many changes, including time limits for receiving benefits, seek to move recipients out of the home and into wage work.  While inadequate access to employment clearly contributes to unstable work histories, poverty, and dependency on programs like Aid to Families with Dependent Children, it is by no means the only barrier to steady work for most welfare recipients.  So while programs that seek to increase employment access -- either by locating jobs and workers near one another or by improving the transportation linkages between jobs and workers -- can help to move people into steady employment and reduce welfare usage, such programs are not a panacea.

Florence Richardson Wyckoff (1905-1997), Fifty Years of Grassroots Social Activism: Volume II Families Who Follow the Crops
Families Who Follow the Crops is divided into four sections. In the opening section Wyckoff discusses her participation in the New Deal gubernatorial campaign of Democrat Culbert L. Olson and her participation in the Olson "crusade", where she became an ardent advocate in behalf of the dispossessed migrant agricultural population in California. In the second section Wyckoff chronicles her political and social life in Washington, D.C., during World War II, where she continued to lobby for migrants at the national level by fighting to maintain the existence of the Farm Security Administration and to educate congress on agricultural issues. She worked with a number of organizations including the National Consumers League, the Women's Joint Congressional Committee, the Office of Price Administration, and Food for Freedom on public education and legislative lobbying on agricultural issues. The third section begins with Wyckoff's settling in Watsonville after the war, where she became a key figure in developing health and social services in Santa Cruz County, including the establishment of the Pajaro Valley Health Council and the Visiting Nurses Association, and in influencing grassroots, community-based health and social service planning. She discusses a number of significant developments in the evolution of local social services. In the final section of the volume, Wyckoff discusses her work on the Governor's Advisory Committee on Children and Youth, to which she was first appointed by Governor Earl Warren in 1948. Her tenure on this advisory committee continued under four governors during which she continued to pursue her investigations of the needs of migrant families and children. One of the most significant developments which grew out of her work on the Children and Youth's subcommittee on Children of Seasonal Farmworkers was the organizing of the five Conferences on Families Who Follow the Crops during the late 1950s and early 1960s. As a major organizer of these events, Wyckoff and her colleagues brought together growers and migrant workers, and convened as well social workers, migrant ministers, teachers, public health workers, labor officials, and members of rural county governments, all of whom were working in different ways to address the living conditions and well-being of migrant families. Wyckoff's interdisciplinary approach in the organizing of the conferences was in itself pioneering and laid the groundwork for legislation addressing migrant health needs. This legislation established public health clinics for farm workers nationwide-- along both the eastern and western migrant streams. The volume concludes with Wyckoff's commentary on the first Conference on Families Who Follow the Crops.

Ambitious obligations : Pentecostalism, social life, and political economy on the Zambian Copperbelt
The most striking characteristics of Pentecostal Christianity on the Zambian Copperbelt are the proliferation of small churches and the near-constant circulation of their members among them. These are the phenomena that this dissertation seeks to explore and explain. Doing so has required me to place Pentecostal practice within the broader social and political economic context of urban Zambia. Social life on the Copperbelt is organized around two parallel relational orientations that I call ambition and obligation, which are in turn structured by a hierarchy of economic success. Shocks to the Copperbelt economy, including the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, make it harder for people to maintain this traditional social model because market insecurity causes the hierarchy of success to become unbalanced. Whereas relational hierarchy on the Copperbelt more generally depends on the market, Pentecostal adherence produces a hierarchy of charisma that is insulated from economic concerns. This religion therefore presents the possibility that culturally important relational forms might find a more secure basis than that which is available outside the church. It is the potential of Pentecostalism to produce hierarchy, ambition, and obligation that makes this form of Christianity so compelling for people in urban Zambia. However, while the social possibilities of Pentecostalism are central to the religious participation of individual believers, it is not always easy for them to keep their relationships separate from economic concerns. The influence of the prosperity gospel, the importance of making gifts to church leaders, and the financial needs of pastors all bring material issues into religious life. When believers perceive that Pentecostal hierarchy has been compromised by these issues they will often leave one church for another that they feel better exemplifies the relational ideals of their religion. Alternately, they may form a new congregation. The social promise of Pentecostalism therefore allows us to understand not only what makes this form of Christianity so compelling, but also why its adherents move so frequently from church to church

[marriage]

Marriage and Divorce
Marriage formed a central social construct of ancient Egyptian culture. It provided the normative framework for producing children, who would act as one’s rightful heirs. The latter were responsible for performing one’s funerary cult, thereby securing one’s eternal life. The economic effects of marriage were also notable. The husband, wife, and children were all perceived as having equal rights to the conjugal joint-property consisting of a 
         1/3
          share each. In addition to this, the spouses might own private property of their own. As marriage modified many aspects of daily life such as social status, domicile, and the intricate network of interpersonal rights and obligations, it was not a relationship entered into at random. A sequence consisting of a choice of partner followed by an exchange of gifts and assets preceded the actual marrying. Once the marital status was a fact, both parties were expected to abstain from extramarital relationships. However, it was possible for men to have several wives.

The Role of Lifestyle and Attitudinal Characteristics in Residential Neighborhood Choice
This paper investigates the importance of attitudinal and lifestyle variables to residential neighborhood choice for 492 residents of three San Francisco Bay Area neighborhoods. One neighborhood, North San Francisco (N=155), was classified as traditional, whereas the other two, Concord (N=165) and San Jose (N=172), were classified as suburban. Separate factor analyses identified 10 attitudinal dimensions and 11 lifestyle dimensions. Mean factor scores for the three neighborhoods differed significantly for most of the factors. For example, consistent with expectations, the mean scores on the pro-high density, pro-environment, pro-pricing, and pro-alternatives attitudinal factors were significantly higher for residents of traditional NSF than for the suburban residents. On lifestyle dimensions, NSF residents were significantly more likely to be culture-lovers, and less likely to be nest-builders and altruists, than suburbanites. These seven factors, together with three sociodemographic variables (number of children under age 16, number of vehicles, and years lived in the Bay Area - all positively associated with the suburban neighborhoods), were significant in the final binary logit model of residential neighborhood choice. The adjusted p^2 for the model was 0.52, and the collective contribution of the attitudinal/lifestyle factors provides support for the usefulness of this approach to residential choice modeling. In particular, it is suggested that this approach will help illuminate the policy-relevant question as to whether observed differences in travel behavior are induced by the land use configuration of the neighborhood itself, or are derived from intrinsic propensities for different travel choices. Evidence is mounting that the second hypothesized mechanism is stronger: that is, that as an explanation for travel behavior, neighborhood type tends to act as a proxy for the "true" explanatory variables with which it is strongly associated, namely attitudinal and lifestyle predispositions.

The politics of representation and the social order : in the War on Terror
This thesis empirically examines how a political administration in power legitimates important and controversial policies in public political discourse over a period of time. Based on an in-depth study of the "politics of representation" processes surrounding the early U.S. War on Terrorism between 2001 and 2004, utilizing more than 1,500 public speeches and documents as data, it shows how the George W. Bush Administration developed and applied a cultural script--the War on Terror script--to create and sustain a socially intelligible "reality" (collective representation) with implications for world politics through its incremental interactions with other political players in public discourse. The constitution and maintenance of this "reality" depended on complex and artful epistemic and discourse practices, including using selective facts, deploying linguistic devices, connecting to deep-seated cultural conceptions, analyzing cost and benefit, mobilizing investigative resources, and enacting coercive political actions. These elaborate representational practices assembled otherwise unconnected events and ideas into intelligible, coherent, meaningful order in different epistemic forms, consequently legitimating many important political decisions that have grave societal and historical effects while suppressing oppositional voices and challenging contradictory evidence. In contrast to existing analyses and criticisms of the Bush Administration's legitimation effort that focus on practices of misinformation, cultural appeal, or arbitrary rhetorical exercises, this research shows the artful uses of a discourse legitimation tool-- the script of the War on Terrorism--that flexibly incorporates and integrates facts and events presented on the political stage over time and sustains many policy arguments pertaining to the War on Terrorism. Showing the richness and versatility of the War on Terror knowledge system, this analysis speaks to the larger issue of the practical formation of political ideology for war by calling attention to the powerful--but often invisible-- uses of deep cultural premises in political reasoning and the incredibly elaborate discursive and evidential mechanisms sustaining those premises. It makes a case for sociological researchers to move beyond interrogating thematic and contextual meanings espoused by public political actors into dissecting situated discursive and epistemic practices upholding those meanings

The Politics of Eros: The Philosophy of Georges Bataille and Japanese New Wave Cinema
This dissertation assesses the relevance of Georges Bataille's philosophy for film studies and explores the conjunction between the political and the erotic operative in his work. It is widely held that, at the time of the German occupation of France, Bataille experienced the "inward turn," which had marked his transformation from being a political activist to a solitary philosopher preoccupied with eroticism. My project contests the view that he had lost interest in politics at that point as it discloses the political dimension of erotic experience. Furthermore, I demonstrate that the logic of the "inward turn" helps to illuminate the work of Japanese New Wave film movement of the 1960s. What precipitates the "inward turn" is the experience of disappointment. In Bataille's case, it stems from the rise of fascism in Europe and the failure of the Left to assume power in France. In the case of Japanese New Wave, it has roots in the political protest movement that opposed yet ultimately failed to offset the renewal of the Japan-U.S. Mutual Security Pact of 1960. In each case, the turn towards eroticism constitutes a different kind of refusal - an act of separation from the social order as opposed to an act of destruction, a movement away from the community of militants and towards the community of lovers.

A Qualitative Exploration of the Effect of Age at Migration  on the Acculturative Processes of Filipino Immigrants:  Implications for Public Health Studies
Background and Significance: Acculturation is commonly used in public health studies to examine and explain differences in health behaviors and outcomes between racial and ethnic groups.  Despite limitations, language preference, length of residence in the U.S., and nativity are typically used as indicators of acculturation.  The purpose of this dissertation research was to explore the transition processes of recent Filipino immigrants via grounded theory and qualitative data collection methods to gain a better understanding of their pre and post migration experiences for future use in culture and health initiatives.  Age at migration was a central point of comparison, with the underlying use of a life course perspective.  Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 Filipino immigrants who migrated 15 years ago or less.  Data were collected on reasons for migration, expectations, post-migration experiences and perceptions, Filipino-influenced behaviors and beliefs, American cultural norms, contact with mainstream institutions, and several health-related domains.  Findings: Immigrants described several factors related to ease of transitions, including prior knowledge of the U.S. and language skills as well as experiencing culture shock.  These factors, in addition to reasons for migration, influenced the type and degree of exposure to mainstream institutions that resulted in further acclimation to the U.S. culture.  Those that had higher levels of exposure to and encounters with institutions had more knowledge of American ways of life and appeared more integrated in the mainstream society.  Further, while language, time since migration, and age at migration had secondary effects on post-migration experiences, they did not directly influence interviewee's integration to U.S. society.  Immigrants' cultural values and beliefs were not replaced by those of the mainstream as is typically assumed via frameworks of acculturation. Further, the core cultural values that interviewees described like the importance of family and respect did not appear to diminish with increasing time since migration. Yet retaining these values also did not tend to hinder people's ability to acclimate to life in the U.S. Conclusion: Traditional acculturation theories and models that are commonly used in public health are not useful for understanding the migration experiences or cultural changes of Filipino immigrants.  More effective frameworks would identify transition domains like language, knowledge, and skills and then examine changes to them.  They would also focus on immigrants' contact with mainstream institutions and their ability at navigating through the new society.  The Filipinos in this sample did not describe processes of being "more American" but rather the gaining of knowledge and skills needed to navigate the U.S.  Public health efforts tailored to Filipino immigrants may be more effective if they incorporate knowledge on migration experiences, the notion of retaining core values and adopting traits needed to integrate to society, and specific values that have been identified to influence attitudes and behavior.

Studies of Temperament in Simian primates with Implications for Socially Mediated Learning
The functions of social learning concern the acquisition of skills and 
      information that enable individuals to adjust competently to their environments. 
      However, individuals differ in the extents to which they cope with, maintain and create 
      social and other environmental opportunities. Hence, it is relevant to consider 
      dispositions of individuals interactively - as with emotion, attention and activity; to 
      emphasise self regulatory behaviour, as with selective attention towards or away from 
      environmental conditions. These propensities facilitate positive and negative responses 
      that are associated with the uptake and use of skill and information from other 
      individuals. In these regards, the study of temperament has fertile but mainly 
      unexplored potential. Examples are given from studies of simian primates in which 
      differences in temperament have predictive implications for social learning. When 
      relatively fearful animals confront challenging situations, they are likely to avoid them 
      and become physiologically disturbed. Less fearful and active animals interact more, 
      and in emotionally more positive ways with other individuals. They are more likely to 
      maintain closer physical proximity to others, to attend more to what they are doing and 
      where. Hence, they have greater chances of facilitating advantageous responses - as in 
      feeding strategies. In the acquisition of social skills, less fearful animals engage in play 
      activities more than relatively fearful animals. Such interactions facilitate the 
      development of information about other individuals, and the quality of social behaviour 
      that is developed. These examples show the value of an integrative approach to 
      behavioural studies - in which behaviour is considered with other biological systems.

John Melendy: Santa Cruz County Farm Advisor, 1947-1976
Melendy served as a Santa Cruz County Farm Advisor with the Agricultural Extension Service for thirty years, including ten as County Director of the Agricultural Extension Service, an administrative position. His duties also encompassed being a youth or 4-H advisor and a poultry/livestock/field crops advisor.
      In this oral history conducted in 1977, John Melendy discusses changes in agriculture in Santa Cruz County from 1940s through the 1970s-- how rising land prices affected the types of crops grown, the effects of mechanization, farm size, pest control and controversies over pesticide use that were only beginning to come to light at that time. A substantial portion of the interview is devoted to a detailed discussion of the rise and fall of the poultry industry in the Live Oak area.
      In addition to providing a history of agriculture in Santa Cruz County, Melendy's narrative contributes to the institutional history of Agricultural Extension Service itself, particularly the position of farm advisor. In 1975 the Extension Service (by then called Cooperative Extension) merged with the Agricultural Experiment Station and became the Division of Agricultural and Natural Resources, which also oversees the University's Natural Reserve System.
      While Melendy's oral history is useful for its detailed descriptions of the methods and practices of farming in the mid-twentieth century on the Central Coast of California, it also documents the tremendous changes that swept Santa Cruz County from 1946 to 1976, as it transitioned from a largely rural, to the urban or suburban landscape it is today.
      John Melendy retired in December 1976, and at the time of this oral history interview in 1977 was enjoying operating a Christmas tree farm on San Miguel Canyon Rd. Oral historian Meri Knaster conducted three interviews with him at his home in Soquel, California as part of the Regional History Project's Agricultural History series. Melendy was fifty-six years old at the time.

Rethinking Sustainability on Planet Earth: A Time for New Framings
Sustainable development and sustainability have been key terms in environmental thought and practice since the time of the Brundtland Report. Because of being firmly situated in the humanist tradition, these terms and their associated approaches have been appealing to social workers tackling environmental concerns. Given the significant and inexorable changes being wrought by global warming and the lack of similitude between Earth prior to anthropogenic warming and the incipient Eaarth introduced by global warming, examining the continued relevance of the terms sustainable development and sustainability is warranted. This chapter explores these terms in the context of climate change and points toward a responsibility approach based on environmental and social justice principles consistent with social work strengths and values.

Policing bodies at the border and the borders within : immigration enforcement and detention in San Diego County and North Carolina
This thesis analyzes immigration enforcement and detention in San Diego County and North Carolina, using ethnographic interviews, local media, public records, and other data. It finds that immigration enforcement practices historically confined to the border are in many ways moving into the interior, largely through local law enforcement collaborations with federal immigration officials. This analysis argues that both regions see expanding local law enforcement collaboration with federal immigration agencies. Secure Communities in both regions, Operation Stonegarden in San Diego County, and 287 g in North Carolina support this argument. It also finds that enforcement in each region occurs as a "patchwork". The patchwork results in part from varied local responses to immigration and the ongoing dialectics between local, state, and federal policy realms. The paper demonstrates this "patchwork" through analyses of contrasting 287 g partnerships in Wake and Durham Counties in North Carolina, varied patterns of local law enforcement referrals to the Border Patrol in San Diego County, and Operation Joint Effort, a unique enforcement collaboration between the Escondido Police Department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The thesis situates enforcement Immigration enforcement

Information Sharing within groups
This dissertation examines the predictors and consequences of information sharing within groups in three papers. The first paper examines the negative impact of ego depletion (i.e., using up limited self-regulatory resources) on preference-relevant information sharing, which in turn reduces integrative outcomes (i.e., outcomes that benefit the whole group) within negotiation groups. The second paper explores the positive effect of group members who have ambivalent attitudes (i.e., attitudes that include positive and negative components) on information sharing within groups. The third paper investigates the effects of divergent task conflict (i.e., discrepant views related to ideas and opinions that occur during the group task work) and convergent task conflict (i.e., discrepant views about the common objective and ultimate solution) on information sharing, which in turn increases group performance. This three-paper dissertation offers new insights on the unexplored antecedents and important outcomes of information sharing.

Excerpt from Florida’s Snowbirds: Spectacle, Mobility, and Community since 1945
Godefroy Desrosiers-Lauzon investigates the phenomenon of the “snowbirds.” Every year, tens of thousands of individuals from eastern Canada and the US Northeast, mainly older people, migrate to Florida for the winter months. Going beyond the usual sociological (and satiric) treatments, Desrosiers-Lauzon studies the development of the migratory flows in the post-1945 period and analyzes them in relation to structural issues in leisure studies, such as the roles of state-promoted tourism, economic development, and environmentalism. Rather than seeing the migrants as contributors to community, either through their presence or their economic input, Floridians have tended to build community by engaging in tourist-bashing—the outsiders being scapegoats for larger concerns over growth and environmental damage. One of the author’s important contributions is in addressing the question of how we should understand this group of border-crossing migrants as constituting “Americans,” and his implicit response to the set of works, of which Lizabeth Cohen’s Making a New Deal is perhaps the most prominent, that foreground the role of cultures of consumption in identity formation.

Citizen-Officers: The Union and Confederate Volunteer Junior Officer Corps in the American Civil War, 1861-1865
This dissertation engages the historiography of American citizenship and identity, republican traditions in American life and thought, and explores the evolution of military leadership in American society during the American Civil War. The nature, experiences and evolution of citizen-soldiers and citizen-officers, both Union and Confederate, reveal that the sentimental, often romantic expectations and ideologies forged in the American Revolution and modified during the antebellum era were recast, adapted, and modified under the extreme pressures of four years of conflict. Civil War citizen-officers experienced extreme pressures to emulate the professional officers of the regular army and to accommodate the ideological expectations of the independent, civic-minded volunteers they led. These junior leaders arrived at creative, often ingenious solutions to overcome the unique leadership challenges posed by the tension between antebellum democratic values and the demands of military necessity. Though the nature and identity of the officers in both armies evolved over time, the ideological foundations that informed Civil War Americans’ conceptions of military service persisted throughout the conflict. The key to the persistence of the citizen-soldier ethos and citizen-officer image during and after the Civil War era lies in the considerable power of antebellum Americans’ shared but malleable republican tradition. By focusing on the experience of volunteer company-grade officers in the Civil War era, we discover how the ordeal of the Civil War forced Americans to reevaluate and reconcile the role of the individual in this arrangement, both elevating and de-emphasizing the centrality of the citizen-soldier to the evolving narrative of American identity, citizenship, and leadership.

From Consanguinity to Consubstantiality: Julian Pitt-Rivers’ ‘The Kith and the Kin’
In 1973, Julian Pitt-Rivers published a chapter in Goody’s The Character of Kinship that, although rather infrequently used and quoted, suggested a work-around to the major criticisms that were expressed towards kinship studies in the 1970s.  Reintroducing the notion of “consubstantiality”, Pitt-Rivers suggested a bringing together of emic and etic approaches to kinship classification and ontology.  As straightforward as it may appear, the concept, when combined with Burke’s use of the notion in relation to that of “context”, crystallizes a methodology for embedding structural and formal approaches of kinship within the social domains of relatedness and action.  While discussing Pitt-Rivers’ proposition, this paper illustrates the application of consubstantiality as an explanatory model of the extension of self in the Australian Western Desert through two examples: the diversity of marriage scenarios and their consequences and the “unusual” usage of some terminological classes in relation to close kin.

All this dies with us : the decline and revision of a Mestizo Gentry (Chumbivilcas, Cuzco, Peru)
Peru has experienced unprecedented social, political, and economic changes over the past fifty years that have left little of the traditional rural social order intact. The consolidation, expansion, and tentative decentralization of the Peruvian state have had particularly profound effects on labor relations, land tenure, electoral politics, administration, and social practice and ideology. New forms of identification and mobilization have helped to undermine traditional distinctions of status and ethnicity. This dissertation focuses on the historical and contemporary experience of the vecinos of Chumbivilcas, a mestizo gentry that once stood at the apex of the old provincial social order. Ethnographic research was spread over twenty months between 2004 and 2008, with all of 2006 spent in the highland province of Chumbivilcas, located in the far south of the Cuzco department of Peru. Data was collected predominantly through formal and informal interviews and participant observation.The dissertation describes the emergence of local indigenist parties, made possible by the expansion of the franchise and motivated in part by increasing fiscal transfers from the central government to municipalities. The accession to power of these parties has, in turn, led to the formation of new indigenous elites. These new parties and leaders have decisively marginalized the old vecino establishment, forcing vecinos, particularly males, to struggle to reframe their values and identities. Most vecinos privately retain diverse elements of traditional racial and ethnic ideologies. Likewise, vecinos and indigenous peasants (or comuneros) continue to discriminate between one another and to informally self-segregate along ethnic lines. With the massive influx of peasants into towns and the rapid disappearance of definitive markers of ethnicity, vecinos must rely increasingly on their detailed genealogical knowledge of the province. As the concrete differences between the two communities decline, vecinos have narrowed the emphasis of their self-identification toward cultural proficiencies and affinities. The result is a vestigial community held loosely together by shared family histories and cultural interests, rather than by formal ethnic institutions and prerogatives. For the vecino community, the future most likely holds increasing emigration to Peru's urban centers and further weakening of local ethnic distinctions

Spatial Structure and Urban Commuting
This paper examines the relationship between urban structure and commuting behavior. Analyzing the 1980 journey-to-work data for the Los Angeles region, this paper has shown that polycenteric density functions fit the actual urban structure better than the conventional monocentric model. This finding indicates the preeminence of accessibilty to major employment centers in location choices.
      This paper also estimates commute flows implied by the polycentric and monocentric functions. It finds the monocentric model very poor at explaining commuting behavior. The empirical results show that polycentric urban structure increases the urban commute. This finding helps to preserve the assumption that urban workers economize on commuting, and suggests that efforts to promote more efficient urban form, such as the jobs-housing balance policy, have the potential to succeed.

Essays on Immigration and the Macroeconomy
This dissertation is comprised of three chapters that study the impact of different types of immigration on the macroeconomy in the presence of labor market frictions.Chapter 1 employs a dynamic general equilibrium model with labor market frictions to explore the economic consequences of illegal immigration. The novel feature of the model is that I allow domestic workers and illegal foreign workers to search for jobs in the same market. An increase in the number of illegal immigrants thus intensifies job competition in the domestic labor market. To the best of my knowledge, it is the first study that explicitly takes into account the job displacement effect induced by illegal immigrants. This study identifies four different channels via which illegal immigration can affect domestic consumption. Previous studies, however, only capture a subset of these forces. Using some realistic parameter values, this study assesses the macroeconomic and welfare effects of illegal immigration quantitatively. The calibrated model generates a U-shaped relationship between the population share of illegal immigrants and consumption per domestic resident in the long run. In the numerical analysis, I also find that increasing the population share of illegal immigrants would induce a welfare gain for the native population.Chapter 2 extends the baseline model developed in Chapter 1 by including heterogeneous workers in the domestic population. In the extended model, all illegal immigrants are unskilled and thus only compete with the domestic unskilled workers for jobs. Skilled domestic workers are insulated from job competition with the illegalimmigrants. The main idea of this extended model is to examine the asymmetric effects of illegal immigration on different skill groups in the native population. It is shown that the long-run effects of illegal immigration on skilled and unskilled domestic consumers are very different. An increase in illegal immigration raises the consumption of skilled consumers and improves their labor market outcomes. On the contrary, unskilled domestic workers' consumption and labor market outcomes are negatively affected by the inflow of illegal immigrants.Chapter 3 focuses on the effects of legal immigration on the native population. To achieve this, I adopt a dynamic general equilibrium model with skill heterogeneity and labor market frictions. Unlike the previous chapters that focus exclusively on unskilled illegal workers, this chapter explicitly takes into account the skill composition of immigrants. Specifically, this study considers the inows of both skilled and unskilled immigrant workers. The model in this chapter captures two opposing effects of immigration. First, native and immigrant workers of the same skill group search inthe same labor market. This creates a job displacement effect of immigration. Second, workers with different skills are complementary in the production process. Thus, immigrants might benefit the natives in a different skill group. A calibrated version of the model is used to quantify these effects. In the numerical analysis, I also examine how unemployment benefits can be used to mitigate the welfare loss due to immigration.

Unsettling Knowledge: Emerging Constructions of Tribal Sovereignty in Southern California
As American Indian tribes across North America have continued to pursue the strengthening of tribal sovereignty, non-Indians increasingly engage in the activities and negotiations entailed in tribal revitalization.  This dissertation examines the diachronic and synchronic aspects of the dynamic relations between revitalizing native nations and their neighboring non-Indian communities in Inland Southern California, home to the densest concentration of American Indian Reservations in the United States.  First, this dissertation examines the historical relations between these native nations and settlers in order to demonstrate how tribal strategies for survival and self-determination underpinned both the economic development of Southern California as well as contemporary tribal revitalization across North America. I draw on ethnohistoric, archaeological and linguistic evidence to illustrate how Serrano and Cahuilla nations provided labor, knowledge and other resources vital for the agricultural and mining industries that fueled the growth of Southern California.  I find that the labor that the Serrano and Cahuilla supplied to settlers also provided these native nations with the economic resources necessary to launch successful campaigns to revitalize their sovereignty, including their foundational roles in the emergence of the Indian casino movement.  Then I employ ethnographic, documentary and consensus analyses to examine the advent and impacts of Indian casinos, through which these tribes began to play increasing roles in their neighboring communities, leading to their increased political and economic prominence and visibility.  With this increasing prominence and visibility new interpretations of tribal communities emerged, including those disseminated by tribes, their supporters, and their political and economic challengers.  Some of these, such as the framing of tribes as corporations, are novel interpretations of tribal identity; however, they increasingly inform political and legal decisions. By documenting the co-variation of tribal political and economic roles and with emerging cultural models of tribes, I demonstrate how tribal actions and revitalization have continuously changed the way settlers think about tribes, and transformed the disposition of tribes in local and national culture and politics.

About 5.9 million additional people will be added to the six county region -- more people than lived in the entire State of Indiana at the time of the last census. While immigration to the region will account for about a third of the population increase, two-thirds will come from natural increase, making the population forecasts somewhat less likely to be impacted by unforeseen events. Whatever the actual population reached by 2010, it is clear that there will be a major increase in population barring a catastrophic earthquake. Jobs are expected to increase by 3 million to a total of approximately 9 million.

Higher Symplectic Geometry
In higher symplectic geometry, we consider generalizations of symplectic manifolds called n-plectic manifolds. We say a manifold is n-plectic if it is equipped with a closed, non-degenerate form of degree (n+1). We show that certain higher algebraic and geometric structures naturally arise on these manifolds. These structures can be understood as the categorified or homotopy analogues of important structures studied in symplectic geometry and geometric quantization. Our results imply that higher symplectic geometry is closely related to several areas of current interest including string theory, loop groups, and generalized geometry.We begin by showing that, just as a symplectic manifold gives a Poisson algebra of functions, any n-plectic manifold gives a Lie n-algebra containing certain differential forms which we call Hamiltonian.  Lie n-algebras are examples of strongly homotopy Lie algebras.  They consist of an n-term chain complex equipped with a collection of skew-symmetric multi-brackets that satisfy a generalized Jacobi identity.We then develop the machinery necessary to geometrically quantize n-plectic manifolds. In particular, just as a prequantized symplectic manifold is equipped with a principal U(1)-bundle with connection, we show that a prequantized 2-plectic manifold is equipped with a U(1)-gerbe with 2-connection. A gerbe is a categorified sheaf, or stack, which generalizes the notion of a principal bundle. Furthermore, over any 2-plectic manifold there is a vector bundle equipped with extra structure called a Courant algebroid.  This bundle is the 2-plectic analogue of the Atiyah algebroid over a prequantized symplectic manifold. Its space of global sections also forms a Lie 2-algebra. We use this Lie 2-algebra to prequantize the Lie 2-algebra of Hamiltonian forms.Finally, we introduce the 2-plectic analogue of the Bohr-Sommerfeld variety associated to a real polarization, and use this to geometrically quantize 2-plectic manifolds. For symplectic manifolds, the output from quantization is a Hilbert space of quantum states. Similarly, quantizing a 2-plectic manifold gives a category of quantum states. We consider a particular example in which the objects of this category can be identified with representations of the Lie group SU(2).

Accessibility and Third World Rural Development: A Case Study of Sumatra
Road and transport service improvements are widely recognized as important catalysts to economic development in most third world countries. When integrated with other programs which create new employment opportunities, roads and bus services enable subsistence farmers to seek off-farm salary-earning jobs. This paper examines the relationship between accessibility and economic well-being using data from rural Sumatra in Indonesia. The research relies on multiple indicators of both measures. Households in more remote rural villages are found to average appreciably lower levels of consumption expenditures. When isolated from subregional market and trade centers, consumption levels fall dramatically. The research also shows that the average value of farm produce increases with road quality, frequency of bus service, and close proximity of commercial centers. Thus, agriculture productivity is linked to both transport supply and spatial proximity factors. Additionally, the analysis shows that off-farm earnings increase when migrant households have access to both motorcycles and bicycles. Loans and subsidies for purchasing such "low tech" vehicles as bicycles, scooters, and micro-buses could prove more beneficial to many rural villagers than capital-intensive road projects. Lastly, the research suggests that the siting of transmigration settlements within reasonable proximity to regional and subregional market centers is important if the planned villages are to develop trade linkages and experience sustained economic growth.

From Resource Management to Political Activism: Civil Society Participation in Nicaragua's Rural Water Governance
How to secure sustainable access to water is an increasingly acute problem that is global in scope. "From Resource Management to Political Activism: Civil Society Participation in Nicaragua's Rural Water Governance" demonstrates that this problem is also one that intersects in crucial ways with democratic political processes. Based upon thirteen months of field research in Nicaragua, this dissertation examines how community-based resource managers and water service providers transcend their rural localities and roles in order to engage in fundamentally new forms of political engagement, advocacy, and networking. After thirty years of constituting a legally-unrecognized resource management scheme in the country's rural areas, Potable Water and Sanitation Committees (CAPS) have formed dozens of new transcommunity, multi-sectoral "CAPS networks." These networks are serving as platforms for the participation of rural social actors in formal politics and their integration into policy processes. Notably, these dynamics are unfolding in an unlikely context: one of extreme political polarization and state attempts at cooptation via new mechanisms of direct democracy at the subnational level. This dissertation is motivated by the puzzle of how CAPS collectively assert themselves across political scales while maintaining autonomy and pluralism--even as the state seeks to incorporate expressions of civil society into partisan channels of citizen participation from above. I argue that this outcome of autonomy and pluralism is explained by three interrelated and mutually-dependent factors: 1) the CAPS' empowerment, capacities, and legitimacy as local resource managers; 2) their alliances with domestic and international NGOs and multilateral organizations; and 3) their strategic discourses of water use, access, and distribution. Principal research methods include semi-structured interviews; participant observation; and review and analysis of government and nongovernmental reports and documents, newspaper articles, and national legislation. Guided by an explicitly interdisciplinary orientation, this dissertation generates more robust theoretical arguments about two important trends in Latin America: democratization and decentralization.

L.A. Story: A Reality Check for Transit-Based Housing
An increasingly influential planning strategy for leveraging rail transit is high-density residential development near rail stations, or 'Transit-Based Housing'. Proponents argue such projects will get more people onto trains, reduce developers' expenses, and lower commuting costs, housing prices, and air pollution in the bargain. While most of the literature has addressed the merit of such projects, this paper considers a separate question: Whatever virtues transit-based housing may have, what are its prospects?
      We find that transit-based housing faces a much steeper uphill battle than the conventional wisdom suggests. Cities' parochial fiscal and economic interests appear to conflict with transit-based housing in several fundamental respects, a view strongly supported by a behavioral analysis of zoning data for all 232 existing and proposed Southern California rail transit stations. Municipalities behave as if they prefer to use rail transit stations for economic rather than residential development, suggesting that transit oriented planning strategies would profit form more attention to their local fiscal and economic benefits.

Gender variance on campus : a critical analysis of transgender voices
Transgender college students face discrimination, harassment, and oppression on college and university campuses; consequently leading to limited academic and social success. Current literature is focused on describing the experiences of transgender students and the practical implications associated with attempting to meet their needs (Beemyn, 2005; Beemyn, Curtis, Davis, & Tubbs, 2005). This study examined the perceptions of transgender inclusion, ways in which leadership structures or entities include/exclude transgender students, and effects of inclusive/exclusive language on transgender students through student's own words and experiences. Consistent with methods to utilize critical theories, students participated in individual interviews regarding their experiences on campus and reviewed campus documents. Findings indicate that while participants of this study did experience some negative reactions on campus, by allowing them to tell their stories we are allowed glimpses into more important (and less talked about) facets of their lives including stereotypes of the transgender community, privileges of being transgender, and the need for individual identification. Critical theory, critical race theory, and feminist theory allowed for deeper analysis of knowledge and truth and the creation of critical transgender theory. Critical transgender theory encourages the questioning of the gender binary, the categorization of transgender people as "other," and the impact that challenging this categorization has on the transgender population

Narrative, Speech, and Action: Gandhi’s Satyagraha and the Constant Becoming of Truth
In this paper, I explore Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolence, specifically his articulation and understanding of the conception of truth. For Gandhi, truth in the political sphere is not merely a correspondence between a representation and external phenomena, but is constantly in the process of becoming as the political actor "experiments" with different notions of truth and the actions which are derived from them. I use the notion of a narrative as opposed to scientific mode of thought in order to highlight the open-ended, constant becoming nature of Gandhi's understanding of truth in political action. I conclude by arguing that Gandhi's notion of truth widens the sphere of political action to a plurality of individual contributions and voices towards a truly nonviolent and engaged society.

The Accessible City: Employment Opportunities in Time and Space
Explosive suburban employment growth, broad processes of economic restructuring, and rapid developments in transportation and telecommunications technologies have fundamentally altered the spatial and organizational composition of both where we work and where we live. How have these broad spatial processes impacted intra-metropolitan accessibility? The research presents an analytical framework for evaluating and monitoring intra-metropolitan accessibility to employment opportunities. More specifically, it (1) determines how accessibility has been defined, modeled, measured, and interpreted: (2) presents a new approach for evaluating intra-metropolitan accessibility founded on the Couclelis proximal space construct, the Getis/Ord G* spatial statistic, a level-of-service definition of accessibility, multiple scale analysis, and a multi-dimensional conceptualization of accessibility processes: and (3) applies this analytical framework, implemented within a GIS environment, to employment data for the Greater Los Angeles region in order to demonstrate its effectiveness and potential for addressing a wide variety of empirical research questions, for contributing to urban theory, and for evaluating urban and transportation planning strategies.

Prospects for Animal Models of Mental Representation
A major goal of physiological psychology is to determine the physical basis of mental representation. Animal models are essential to this project. Dretske's influential analysis of the concept of mental representation suggests that operant and classical conditioning involve mental representation. This analysis comports well with known physiological mechanisms of conditioning, but fails to capture necessary features of mental representation at the human level. We conclude that the applicability of animal models to the problem to human mental representation is more restricted than previously thought.

The good lake, the possible sea : ethics and environment in Northern Vanuatu
People on the island of Gaua in northern Vanuatu have witnessed a series of demographic transformations over the past one hundred years, from Anglican mission-driven resettlement to more recent regional migrations from nearby islands. The distinctions which organized social life in Gaua's past have given way to a new division between indigenous landowning families and various communities of non-indigenous "renters," people from elsewhere permanently settled in the island's east. Kastom, the category of worldviews and associated practices regarded as autochthonous, has provided indigenous Gauans with a sense of cultural-historical continuity in the face of such extensive change. This dissertation examines two interrelated fields of action and experience--ethics and human-environment interaction--to address questions of how kastom provides continuity and how it is challenged by the exigencies of contemporary life in a small subsistence society in insular Melanesia. Indigenous Gauans describe a set of ethical capacities and responsibilities which are particular to them as kastom persons--that is, as "persons of the place" who trace local tribal connections to land and to each other. Such persons perceive shared human- ontological traits of situational risk and frailty as catalysts for ethical responsibility, fulfilled through expressions of care made possible through productive subsistence work. They understand situational vulnerability as moments of possibility for creating and maintaining social relations, producing meaningful futures for self and others, and affirming identities as autochthonous persons with unique moral attributes. Recent changes to subsistence regimes, owing to such factors as NGO-led conservation initiatives, shifting climatological patterns, and the introduction of new fishing technologies, have motivated concerns about another type of vulnerability--that of local ecologies to anthropogenic disturbance. Discourses of ecological vulnerability, disseminated by external agencies and locally transformed, tend to reduce Gaua's residents to uniform statuses of "stakeholder" or "vulnerable subject." These discourses and their associated practices erase ethically relevant distinctions among persons with respect to the productive capacities and responsibilities comprehended as kastom. For indigenous Gauans, kastom emerges as the precarious space for possibility--the locus of struggle for cultural- historical continuity i a changing social and ecological landscape

The Diurnal Path of the Sun: Ideology and Interregional Interaction in Ancient Northwest Mesoamerica and the American Southwest
The Postclassic period (AD 900-1521) in Mesoamerica marked an era of significant social change. During this period of time in the American Southwest, Puebloan cultures also engaged in their own major social transformations. A central concern of archaeologists has been to seek connections between these two broad regions and these social changes, whether in material culture or ideology, that help to clarify the nature and extent of long-distance interaction and integration of people in the past.  This dissertation primarily examines the rise of two major cultural traditions in Northwest Mexico: the Casas Grandes and Aztatlán cultures. To understand these cultures, and the nature of their social, political, economic, and religious organization, is to enable scholars to understand how social change on a continental scale was intertwined and interrelated. This work argues that the rise of the Aztatlán and Casas Grandes cultures was primarily due to the expansion of a new worldview and an entire system of beliefs and socio-political organization, with local manifestations, that was centered upon the Flower World complex, a cosmological framework that penetrated to the core of every aspect of the life of an individual and the community. The adoption of this religious complex, a veritable world religion centered upon the sun and a floral paradisal realm, was at the heart of nearly every major social change in Northwest Mesoamerica and the American Southwest after AD 900. This belief system continues to play a significant role in social change to the present day.     Drawing from the spectrum of academic disciplines, this work reflects a broadly humanistic approach in the comparative study and synthesis of data from archaeology, ancient and contemporary religion and symbolism, literature, arts, and native oral histories. Thus, it is uniquely suited for the goal of reconstructing a balanced social history of past and present culture change in the American Southwest and Mesoamerica. The goal of this research is to construct a new conceptual framework for scholars to obtain a better understanding of the mechanisms by which religious beliefs were transmitted and transformed in the past in local and regional cultural contexts across time and space.

Aiding and abetting : how international humanitarian assistance can inadvertently prolong conflict and how combatants respond
The provision of humanitarian assistance has rapidly become a core component of modern peacebuilding and post- conflict reconstruction. Yet, despite the normative appeal of providing humanitarian assistance to the victims of violent conflict, aid workers and analysts frequently claim that humanitarian assistance can inadvertently prolong war. If such claims are true, the very treatment that the international community has been employing to address the consequences of violent conflict may actually be prolonging war and increasing the amount of suffering over time. To date, however, the evidence to support these claims is mostly anecdotal, and a satisfying theoretical link between humanitarian aid and the duration of war has yet to be specified. This dissertation explores the link between humanitarian aid and the duration of war both theoretically and empirically through a series of four papers, with each paper serving as a chapter. I show how humanitarian aid can inadvertently prolong civil war when disbursed during conflict (Chapter 3) and how humanitarian aid can undermine peace when disbursed in the aftermath of civil conflict (Chapter 4). I also show that - as a result of these effects - combatants strategically respond to aid provisions by violently attacking aid workers (Chapter 5). In each paper, I test propositions econometrically using observational data to estimate the relationship between the level of aid and political violence at the macro and micro levels

Association between Intimate Partner Violence and Health Behaviors of Female Emergency Department Patients
Introduction: We assessed the correlation between intimate partner violence (IPV) and health behaviors, including seat belt use, smoke alarm in home, handgun access, body mass index, diet, and exercise. We hypothesized that IPV victims would be less likely to have healthy behaviors as compared to women with similar demographics.
      Methods: All adult female patients who presented to 3 Atlanta-area emergency department waiting rooms on weekdays from 11AM to 7PM were asked to participate in a computer-based survey by trained research assistants. The Universal Violence Prevention Screen was used for IPV identification. The survey also assessed seatbelt use, smoke alarm presence, handgun access, height, weight, exercise, and diet. We used chi-square tests of association, odds ratios, and independent t-tests tomeasure associations between variables.
      Results: Participants ranged from 18 to 68 years, with a mean of 38 years. Out of 1,452 respondents, 155 patients self-identified as white (10.7%), and 1,218 as black (83.9%); 153 out of 832 women who were in a relationship in the prior year (18.4%) screened positive for IPV. We found significant relationships between IPV and not wearing a seatbelt (p,0.01), handgun access (p,0.01), and eating unhealthy foods (p,0.01).
      Conclusion: Women experiencing IPV are more likely to exhibit risky health behaviors than women who are not IPV victims. West J Emerg Med. 2012;13(3):278–282.

The Coming Environmental Crisis in the Middle East: A Historical Perspective, 1750-2000 CE
This essay argues that the Middle Eastern environment, with its legacy of squandered water resources, deforestation and pollution of all kinds, reveals a distilled essence of the coming environmental crisis of the planet. This is so because of the evident vulnerability of Middle Eastern semi-arid and arid landscapes. The essay examines the transformation of the regional environment over the period 1750-2000 CE. It considers modern human impacts in three broad ecological zones: the Middle East of the river valleys (where we survey the role of engineers in major water management projects), the Mediterranean zone of dryfarming (where we examine the imposition of the California model of irrigation in Morocco), and the pastoral rangelands (where we evaluate the impact of scientific range management in the Maghreb). In the course of this survey, we come to understand that modernity was an outgrowth of a deeply rooted Eurasian development project. Ottoman reformers did not need the authorization of the West to adopt the fruits of this dimension of the developmentalist project, since they already internalized it from the start. Colonial policies toward the environment differed little from those adopted by indigenous modernizing elites. We conclude that from an environmental perspective, the history of the Middle East reveals an underlying continuity between the pre-colonial, colonial, and postcolonial periods, despite the undoubted massive environmental transformations introduced since 1800.

The Motif of Fate in Homeric Epics and Oedipus Tyrannus
This dissertation examines the concept of fate in Greek antiquity from a literary perspective, looking into how and why a literary text uses fate in a certain way. The main texts of this study are the two Homeric epics and Sophocles' <italic>Oedipus Tyrannus<italic>. The chief method of this study is literary analysis, which includes close reading of texts, attention to semantic fields, the analysis of story plot, and the comparison of a series of texts over time and across genre. I also pay attention to the problem of formulaic composition and borrow from the methods of folklore studies. This combination of methods helps to understand Sophocles' innovation in the <italic>Oedipus Tyrannus<italic> and the figure of Oedipus. The Homeric epics present heroes and their fates in the context of oral composition and transmission. As songs that laud the hero's &#954;&#955;&#941;&#959;&#962; in immortal memory, Homeric epics do not problematize free will or portray conflicts between the heroes and their fates. This Homeric system of literary representation of hero and his fate, together with its social role, lost context in the fifth century Athens. When traditional beliefs were challenged and new concepts and ways of thinking arose, the old values and solutions for the hero and fate, which the Homeric epics presented, were no longer valid. In the <italic>Oedipus Tyrannus<italic>, Sophocles' portrayal of Oedipus shows his thinking on a different kind of hero and a new relation between the hero and his predicted fate. In the <italic>Oedipus Tyrannus<italic> Oedipus is a hero who outlived his good reputation and saw its dissipation. In a sense, the play demonstrates to what an extent a person is able to face the truth of one's fate, however terrible it is and whatever responsibility it incurs. Oedipus may not be a laudable hero, but his sufferings and his confrontation with fate deserves respect. It is through such a hero that Sophocles gives meaning to the life of his day.

Gimp Anthropology: Non-Apparent Disabilities and Navigating the Social
Individuals with non-apparent, physical disabilities face unique social challenges from those that are encountered by the more visibly disabled. The absence of visible cues indicating physical impairment causes ambiguity in social situations, leaving the sufferer vulnerable to moral judgments and social sanctions when they are unable to embody and perform to cultural norms. This dynamic generates a closeted status that the individual must learn to navigate. Using Eve Sedgwick's "The Epistemology of the Closet," this paper deploys auto-ethnography, traditional ethnographic techniques, and literature reviews to illuminate a third space of functioning between the outwardly 'healthy' and the visibly disabled.

The Environmental Consequences of Sprawl
In 1950, the US population was just over 152 million. Today, the population exceeds 298 million. Growth has not been even; much of it has occurred in the West and South. Although every state grew in population between 1950 and 2004, just three states – California, Texas, and Florida – accounted for 30% of the population growth (Table 1). Furthermore, these three states, which together represent 14% of the US land area, are projected to account for half of the total US population growth over the next twenty years. Yet the New York metropolitan area, with a population of over 20 million, is the largest metropolitan area in the US and one of the largest in the world; the population of the New England and Middle Atlantic States made up 21% of the US total, though the eleven states account for only five percent of the land area.

The Imprint of Preferences and Racial Attitudes in the 1990s: A Window Into Contemporary Residential Segregation Patterns in the Greater Boston Area
If we truly desire to keep integration on the upswing and to hasten segregation’s descent, we must continue to effectively harness and improve the resources and tools at our disposal—including social science research.
      In the last quarter of the twentieth century, three of the most important socioeconomic and demographic factors contributing to the decline in residential segregation were the suburbanization of people and jobs, the economic prosperity of the 1990s, and the surge in the number of multiethnic metropolitan areas. These trends started slowly in the 1960s and 1970s, gained momentum in the 1980s, and surpassed most expectations in the 1990s (Frey & Farley 1996; Glaeser & Vigdor 2002; U.S. Bureau of the Census 2003). Still, residential segregation is demonstrably complex and resistant to change. Many cities surely will remain highly segregated (and, in the case of a select few, hypersegregated) for decades to come. Despite the progress that has been made to date, residential segregation remains one of the most vexing social and policy problems facing American society.

Articulating Agency: Women in Shakespeare's History Plays
Shakespeare's history plays contain some of the most beloved (Falstaff) and the most reviled (Richard III) of all characters in the corpus. While a number of male characters achieve "life" in these works, women appear sparingly. Though women regularly assume starring roles in the comedies and tragedies, the history plays remain largely the purview of men and a warlike masculinity that allots little place for either the feminine or the domestic. My work finds a space for those women who do inhabit the plays, arguing that, while they may at times be vilified, they exercise a tremendous amount of agency and engage in a gendered and historical performance validated by the drama. Starting primarily from the work of Jean Howard and Phyllis Rackin, I seek to expand the potential readings of women in the history plays, looking at the ways they challenge and participate in traditional historical narratives. In the representations, and successes, of women such as Joan Puzel, Margaret of Anjou, and Mistress Nell Quickly, Shakespeare's histories rewrite the almost exclusively masculine domain of the source texts, inserting an alternative and feminine voice into the construction of the historical account.

Hearts of Darkness: Race and Urban Epistemology in American Noir
The central aim of this dissertation is to effectively trace the intersection of race and urban epistemology by examining representations of the American metropolis in literary and cinematic noir. In addition to analyzing classic hard-boiled texts and noir films, I introduce a new range of texts that suggestively argue for the racialization of the city as a significant source of noir anxiety; these texts, I contend, speak directly to the complexities in the evolution of noir and its many subgenres and appropriations. One of the primary interests of my dissertation, then, is to explicate the ways in which race narrativizes the city, and in turn, how the city narrativizes race. In my investigation, I look to social histories of cities as well as theories of urban phenomena, which provides me with a useful historical entry point in reading the noir city as producing powerful fictions of urban epistemology. In my analysis, I include readings of Dashiell Hammett's Personville, Raymond Chandler and Walter Mosley's opposing epistemologies of postwar Los Angeles, and noir's repeated use of Chinatown as an exotic mise-en-scène. I end my analysis with a provocative suggestion that Iceberg Slim and Sam Greenlee's narratives are mutations of noir, where the black ghetto is the contemporary incarnation of the "mean streets" that produces a different set of noir heroes - the pimp, spy, and hipster. Stifled by carceral conditions and white surveillance practices, these new noir protagonists may "own" the streets, but they also reveal that positing the black male body as a site of the hyper-urbane produces its own set of profoundly mythic constructions.

Essays on Voter and Legislative Behavior in  Coalitional Democracies
In this dissertation I examine the reciprocal relationship between voters and political parties in coalitional democracies in three essays. First, I investigate how voters alter their perceptions of political parties in response to their participation in coalition cabinets. I argue that voters view coalition participation as broad and wide-ranging policy compromise and update their perceptions of the policy positions of cabinet participants accordingly. I ﬁnd that voters perceive coalition partners as more similar than parties that are not currently coalesced, all else equal. In the following essay, I examine the electoral repercussions of this shift in perceptions by proposing a model of voting that considers coalition policy-making. I argue that voters will equate the policy compromise they perceive in the cabinet with a failure to rigorously pursue the policies they were promised and that voters who perceive compromise will punish the incumbent. The data reveals that this perception may cost incumbent cabinets about 2.5% of their vote share. Finally, I move from the electorate to the legislature to investigate if and how these perceptions condition legislative behavior. The previous essays suggest that coalition parties have substantial motivation to differentiate themselves from their partners in cabinet when voters perceive them as becoming more similar. I test this argument by examining partisan behavior in legislative review. The data show that coalition partners who are perceived as more similar are more likely to amend one another’s legislation.

States of Suffering: Marital Cruelty in Antebellum Virginia, Texas, and Wisconsin
This dissertation explores the nature of marriage, violence, and region in the mid-nineteenth-century United States. Based on more than 1,500 divorce cases, it argues that marriages were often characterized by open enmity, not companionate harmony. Violence and cruelty between spouses generally erupted as part of ongoing struggles for power in the household and in the relationship. As the only book-length study of marital cruelty for a southern state, this work challenges much of what historians have argued about the relationship between violence and region. It finds that, contrary to what is generally understood about the American South, marriages in Texas and Virginia were not exceptionally violent, at least not compared with those in Wisconsin. The presence of marital cruelty was most pronounced in environments suffering from gender role instabilities. As the statement above shows, this dissertation takes seriously the use of gender as a lens through which to analyze marital discord. Correcting the historical perception of women’s violence as trivial, rare, or defensive, this dissertation contends that antebellum wives were indeed capable, and often willing, to commit a wide variety of cruelties within marriage. This work presents the first multi-state comparative study of marital discord focusing on the United States.  Exploring nineteenth-century marriages from “way, way below” allows us to move beyond ideals to examine the messiness and unhappiness that characterized many conjugal unions.

The Role of Repeated Interactions, Self-Enforcing Agreements and Relational SubContracting: Evidence from California Highway Procurement Auctions
We examine the impact of relationships between contractors and subcontractors on firm pricing and entry decisions in the California highway procurement market using data from auctions conducted by the California Department of Transportation. Relationships in this market are valuable if they mitigate potential hold-up problems and incentives for ex post renegotiation due to contractual incompleteness. An important characteristic of informal contracts are that they must be self-enforcing, so that the value of relationships between firms and suppliers depend on the extent of possibilities for future interaction. We construct measures of the stock of contractors’ prior interactions with relevant subcontractors and find that a larger stock of relationships leads to lower bids and a greater likelihood of entry. Importantly, this relationship does not hold in periods of time and areas with little future contract volume, suggesting that the self-enforcement mechanism is crucial inproviding value for informal contracts.

"With Love, From Me to You": The Impact of Love Stories Heard on Love Stories Lived
This study compared how newlyweds whose parents were either married (NMs) or divorced (NDs) incorporated lessons learned from others' love stories into their own decision to marry. Fifty-six newlyweds (37 NMs, 19 NDs) were interviewed about their decision to marry, their parents' love story, their peers' love stories, and other love stories that influenced them, such as novels and other media. Responses were coded for the source of influential love stories, lessons learned from these stories, themes of parents' love stories and their direction of influence, and own marriage decision rationale. NDs were less likely than NMs to report being influenced by parents' love stories, more likely to be negatively influenced by parents' love stories, more likely to view such stories as practical rather than romantic, and more likely to marry for romantic than practical reasons.  Otherwise, the two groups did not differ with regard to the lessons they learned from others' love stories or the reasons they provided for deciding to marry. The findings suggest that regardless of parents' marital status, young adults reconcile multiple and often contradictory models of romantic relationships when making the decision to marry.

The Perceptions of Globalization at a Public Research University Computer Science Graduate Department
Based on a qualitative methodological approach, this study focuses on the understanding of a phenomenon called globalization in a research university computer science department. The study looks into the participants' perspectives about the department, its dynamics, culture and academic environment as related to globalization. The economic, political, academic and social/cultural aspects of the department are taken into consideration in investigating the influences of globalization.Three questions guide this inquiry: 1) How is the notion of globalization interpreted in this department? 2) How does the perception of globalization influence the department in terms of finances, academics, policies and social life And 3) How are these perceptions influence the selection of students? Globalization and neo-institutional view of legitimacy is used as theoretical lenses to conceptualize responses to these questions.The data include interviews, field notes, official and non-official documents. Interpretations of these data are compared to findings from prior research on the impact of globalization in order to clarify and validate findings.Findings show that there is disagreement in how the notion of globalization is interpreted between the doctoral students and the faculty in the department. This disagreement revealed the attitudes and interpretations of globalization in the light of the policies and procedures related to the department. How the faculty experience globalization is not consistent with the literature in this project. The literature states that globalization is a big part of higher education and it is a phenomenon that causes the changes in the goals and missions of higher education institutions (Knight, 2003, De Witt, 2005).

Distributed leadership and social networks in the school- based development of the International Baccalaureate's Middle Years Program in a Venezuelan K-12
Deep and careful analysis of the collective work of teachers and school administrators as they embark on the development of innovative instructional programs, such as the International Baccalaureate's Middle Years Program (MYP), is essential to building models for 21st century education. Two theoretical frameworks, distributed leadership and social networks, have emerged in the educational research literature that as integrated by this study present leadership for school-based change and innovation efforts in terms of actions related to the school's central mission and emphasize the importance of social interactions for their enactment. This exploratory case study draws upon its integration of these theories to describe and understand leadership in action during the school-based design and early implementation of the MYP curricular master plan as well as the social networks underlying enactment of leadership actions. The study presents findings on two levels: educational theory and educational practice. In terms of theory, the study proposes that leadership tasks for the school-based development of academic programs are classified as curriculum design tasks and teacher support tasks. These tasks take on distinct social distributions that respond to the nature of the task and contextual factors explored in the study that influence its enactment. It is further proposed that integration of social network theory into its framework reshapes the distributed leadership model in two ways: it asserts the multiplicity of actors involved in leadership actions thus making the leader-plus aspect an unnecessary category in and of itself and it becomes the driving method for measuring and lens for understanding the social distribution of leadership tasks. On a practical level, the study highlights (1) the importance of coherence-building, collaborative design task for a systemic instructional vision, (2) the critical role of teacher support tasks that provide key resources for the successful enactment of design tasks, (3) the promotion of certain school- and team-level conditions that support collaborative processes, and (4) the existence of certain school- and team-level conditions that constrain teacher collaboration

Instruments of Violence: Pain and Value in Guantanamo Bay
This thesis examines the methods and meanings of violence within the detention center in Guantánamo Bay. I propose that the violence perpetrated by U.S. agents against detainees is guided by an ethical rationality rooted in liberal definitions of freedom as well as peculiarly neoliberal commensurability between certain modes of pain and the purported `value' of intelligence. Through an exploration of government reports as well as journalistic accounts of the detention center, I articulate this rationality by describing the way intelligence is produced and commodified in Guantanamo, reviewing the ethical structure of interrogation conducted by U.S. agents and by investigating the ethical subject-hood of detainees.

Identity Change
Using identity theory, this dissertation investigates how the incongruence between reflected appraisals and identity meanings influence identity change.  This study also examines the effect of status, salience, commitment, and changes in social situations on identity change.  To examine how identity processes are related to identity change, three identities are examined: the gender identity, the ethnic identity, and the student identity.  Data were obtained from 1,514 undergraduate students at a large western university during the 2008-09 academic school year.  A longitudinal research design was used.  All data were collected via the Internet to minimize class disruption, ensure easy access to the survey, and maintain privacy.  A key finding is that identity meanings change in the direction of reflected appraisals.  This is one way that individuals can minimize the distress created when situational meanings do not match identity standard meanings.  Study limitations and areas for future research are provided.

The Political Incorporation of Muslim Americans: Are They on the Outside Looking In?
Are Muslims incorporated into American politics?  The use of both interviews and statistical analyses, I seek to provide an understanding of where Muslim Americans are in the process of political incorporation.  By looking at several areas of political incorporation, I establish that Muslim Americans are in the early stages of political incorporation.  I begin by providing the American political development of Muslim Americans.  This then sets the stage of a series of statistical analyses, where I look at vote choice in two presidential elections, civic and political participation and the relationships between issue preferences, ideology and partisanship.  In addition, through the importance of certain predictors, including religiosity, race and ethnicity and discrimination, I show that Muslim Americans may have presence in the politics, but lack any real weight.  Muslim Americans may have gained some social, political and economic power but they are unable to shed their stigmatization and emerge from the margins.

Expatriate Effectiveness and Cultural Intelligence Among Multiculturals and Monoculturals Abroad
With globalization, there is an increasing need for employees who can successfully work abroad. Unfortunately, international assignments are failing, with expatriates returning home prematurely. Multicultural individuals may be ideal candidates for these cross-cultural assignments; however, there is a dearth of research on both multicultural students and employees abroad, and no research testing the propositions that these multicultural individuals would be culturally intelligent and high-functioning expatriates.In this dissertation, I investigated the expatriate effectiveness and cultural intelligence of multicultural and monocultural individuals using on-line longitudinal data from 57 study-abroad students (possible future expatriates). I found that cultural intelligence predicted greater expatriate adjustment and that it increases after the study-abroad experience. Furthermore, multicultural individuals were better psychologically adjusted than monocultural individuals while abroad. I also examined differences in expatriate effectiveness and cultural intelligence based on bicultural individuals' cultural integration (acculturation) and bicultural identity integration (BII), with the finding that cultural integration predicted better academic performance abroad. Exploratory analyses with transnational individuals revealed that they had poorer psychological adjustment and lower academic performance while abroad, and lower cultural intelligence after studying abroad (despite similar levels of cultural intelligence before studying abroad) compared to other multicultural individuals.This dissertation was able to replicate previous findings on cultural intelligence and expatriate effectiveness and to extend those findings to study-abroad students and multicultural individuals. More research is needed to further understand the cultural intelligence of multicultural individuals, and the ways in which cultural intelligence might relate to BII. The findings regarding transnationalism suggest that the process of adapting to living and working in another country may be different when that country is the country of one's heritage. This dissertation contributes to the understanding of multicultural individuals' global mobility and provides a foundation on which to conduct further research on expatriate effectiveness, cultural intelligence, multiculturalism, and transnationalism. Finally, based on these findings, multinational corporations may want to select multicultural individuals for expatriation, and provide training to maximize the benefits of having multicultural expatriates by helping them to integrate their cultures and to minimize potential drawbacks by helping transnational multicultural expatriates develop realistic expectations of their heritage country.

Promote Democratic Citizenship among Rural Women: A Chinese NGO’s Two Models
A Beijing-based non-governmental organization (NGO) strives to empower rural Chinese women and migrant girls by increasing their awareness of constitutional rights and promoting their capacities to exercise their civil and political rights. This article reports the NGO leaders’ perceptions of the goals, strategies, and challenges in their citizenship endeavor, and analyzes their educational activities in theoretical and cultural contexts. By reporting a tension between the two founding leaders and unpacking the different approaches they take to engaging rural women, we demonstrate how the conceptualization of human rights education in the rural Chinese context is influenced by three approaches to human rights—the Confucian emphasis of rites, the Western tradition of emphasizing law, and the “human functional capacities” approach—and how the implementation process is constrained by China’s political framework, the social conditions of rural women, and the NGO leaders’ vantage points.

San Francisco Gangs
San Francisco’s Mission District is a place where urban violence goes along with cupcake stores and high-end restaurants. The Mission District consists of a new wave of businesses and culture, and a large Hispanic community that is threatened by gentrification.  A few Hispanic youth view gang life as a romantic idea to escape from a reality of poverty and what they perceived as disrespect.
      The current wave of violence is nothing new. The neighborhood has seen Norteños and Sureños rage in what seems a pointless war for decades- a war for respect, culture and against a society many will never attempt to join. But the Mission gangs have changed. Today most gang members are youth that has been left behind in a demographic shift. Escaping this world is hard because gangs would have to leave what they come to see as their family. In the meantime the violence continues between two groups who have forgotten why they fight. They are fueled by a history of violence and the belief that, “If you fear me, you’ll respect me.”
       
      The Norteños (who identified themselves with the color red) and theSureños, (who go by the color blue) continue to wage a war that has killed hundreds in drive by shooting, stabbing and beatings. Many others end up wounded or jailed. Bur recently gentrification brought a decline of gang culture. Homicides and violent crimes decreased. It was forgotten that behind the boutiques and high end a restaurants there is world of gangs who kill and die for the colors red and blue. The community fights for the soul of these men and woman while at the same time it fights to remove them from society. This project is a small glimpse to the complex world of San Francisco’s gangs.

Specification Issues in Models of Population and Employment Growth
Spatial econometric adaptations of population and employment growth models have been used to study the employment impacts of urban rail transit (Bollinger and Ihlanfeldt, 1997), the links between urban and rural development (Henry, Barkley, and Bao, 1997; Schmitt and Henry, 2000), and causality between intra-metropolitan population and employment location (Boarnet, 1994b). Yet the literature has so far given limited attention to two specification issues that are fundamental to the performance of spatial econometric population and employment growth models. First, the weight matrix, which defines how geographic units of observation relate to one another, must be defined a priori, and alternative versions of the weight matrix have rarely been consistently compared. Second, most recent population-employment growth models are lagged adjustment models, yet the estimated lag parameters often imply that the system does not adjust to a long-run equilibrium, violating one of the maintained hypotheses of the lagged adjustment approach. This paper analyzes those three specification issues, and provides insight into both the validity of various econometric practices that have been common in recent literature and the stability of econometric population and employment growth models when typical assumptions and approaches are changed.

Walking, Bicycling, and Urban Landscapes: Evidence from the San Francisco Bay Area
Car-dependent cities, some claim, contribute to obesity by discouraging walking and bicycling. This paper uses household activity data from the San Francisco region to study the links between urban environments and non-motorized travel. Factor analysis is used to represent the urban design and land-use diversity dimensions of built environments. Combining factor scores with control variables, like steep terrain, which gauge impediments to walking and cycling, discrete-choice models are estimated. Builtenvironment factors exerted far weaker, though not inconsequential, influences on walking and cycling than control variables. Stronger evidence on the importance of urban landscapes in shaping foot and bicycle travel is needed if the urban planning and public health professions are to forge an effective alliance against car-dependent sprawl.

Examining Implicit Acculturation and Bicultural Identity Integration
With the increase of cross-cultural contacts worldwide, new types of ethnic/cultural identities start to develop and take shape for individuals.  Most of this research has examined the cross-cultural influences on identity by asking individuals to consciously answer questions using self-report measures. What is less known is to what extent cross-cultural contact influences identity outside of conscious awareness? Thus, the present research examined to what extent individuals implicitly incorporate cross-cultural knowledge and/or experiences into their self-concept. Due to the limitations of self-report measures in measuring the self-concept, the current research used the Implicit Associate Test (IAT) (Greenwald, McGhree, & Schwartz, 1998) to assess implicit representations of the self-concept. The IAT's main purpose is to measure the relative strength of automatic associations between mental representations of concepts. In particular, Study 1 examined differences in the strength of identification with both ethnic (e.g., Mexican) and mainstream (e.g., American) cultures among multigenerational Mexican American college students. That is, the extent to which Mexican American participants implicitly endorsed Berry's (2003) four acculturation strategies (i.e., integration, separation, assimilation, marginalization) using a 3 IAT design. Study 2 went beyond the realm of Study 1 and examined the underlying dynamics of bicultural identity at an implicit level.  That is, the extent to which Mexican American bicultural college students implicitly negotiates or integrates their dual cultural identities into their self-concept. A phenomenon known as Bicultural Identity Integration (BII; Benet-Martínez & Haritatos, 2005)The findings across both studies are consistent with Devos (2006) and with the image rising from modern research on acculturation and bicultural identity that individuals often find themselves immersed into multicultural surroundings and define themselves along numerous cultural boundaries and incorporate into their self-concept knowledge about a variety of cultures.  An important innovation of the present research provided evidence for acculturation strategies and the integration of bicultural identities into the self-concept through assessments of thoughts that cannot be consciously controlled. That is, the results of both studies clearly demonstrated that at least under certain circumstances, cultural knowledge and/or experience can implicitly be incorporated into the self-concept.

The Dynamics of Democratic Representation
The linkage between the public and the political decision makers is one of the essential topics for the study of democratic political systems. Most of the previous literature views elections and political representation as a discrete decision-making process. This essay suggests that rather than a discrete, point-in-time choice, democracy is based on a process of ongoing, dynamic representation that occurs through a comparison of the past and the future across repeated elections. Thus, we examine the empirical correspondence between citizens and their government over time based on the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems as a test of the dynamic model. The results strongly argue that there is a high level of democratic representation in contemporary democracies, and elections serve as a dynamic steering method to keep government in synch with their publics.

His dream has come true. There's now more than one vehicle for every licensed driver in the United States, and other developed countries are not far behind.

Conventional wisdom of market researchers, consultants, and other experts is that the automobile and its petroleum-powered internal combustion engine will be with us for a long time and that any energy and environmental problems can be readily solved.

What if people and governments begin to demand and expect even higher environmental quality? And how will the United States and other developed nations respond to growing oil imports?

Organizing the Brown Tide: La Gran Epoca Primavera 2000 en Los Angeles, an Insider's Story
The three largest mass mobilizations ever witnessed in this country occurred in 2006 on March 25th,  April 10th, and May 1st, when undocumented immigrants and supporters marched against repressive enforcement-only antiimmigrant legislation and then for immigration reform.  Academics have since scrambled to understand these mobilizations.  Some misguidedly labeled the Latino community as a "Sleeping Giant."  Contrarily, interviewed in this research were dozens of veteran Immigrant Rights Movement (IRM) activists who illustrated that there is a longstanding immigrant rights struggle in the cradle of the IRM, Los Ángeles, the majority of which have been mobilizing against repressive antiimmigrant legislation as far back as the 1960's.  Drawing from the social movement literature, this dissertation utilizes two dominant concepts to examine the IRM - the political opportunities and resource mobilizations models.  From the dual perspective of a participant and researcher, the present researcher examines the IRM's organizational history in order to understand the decision-makers, while paying closer attention to the efforts leading up to and during the spring 2006 mobilizations, thus providing a unique contribution to this literature based on an insider perspective of the Movimiento.  In this analysis, two factions in the IRM emerge, the leftist faction that includes both the radical and traditional factions of the Movement, and the moderate faction that represents the elite level of the IRM.  The traditional faction by itself has gained much respect amongst the immigrant rights community in LA and has a history of working with either the radical or moderate factions.  This research found the necessity for a future examination of the immigrant community's response to join in the IRM's mobilizations to investigate more systematically the effectiveness of leaders and organizations in their mobilizing efforts by which to guide the immigrant rights community's future endeavors.  It also challenges other students of social movements and Latino Studies to involve themselves in the Movimiento to garner first an insider perspective that would draw a more in-depth look into the inner-workings of the IRM, thus reliably adding to the extant social movement literature, the burgeoning literature on the IRM, and Latino Studies.

The US Policy on Women, Peace and Security: Feminist Empowerment or Masculinist Protection?
The United States Government has been concerned about Third World Women for some time now, especially since the terrorist attack of 9/11. The US Government has been interested in these women in a very particular way feeling a sort of political mission to save them from their oppressive men and culture. This attitude has already been interrogated and criticized by many feminist scholars (Ferguson 2007 et al) and hence, in my research I focus on a different approach deriving from the UNSC Resolution 1325 (2000) aiming to empower women in conflict and postconflict settings.
      This paper critically looks at the US policy on Resolution 1325 from a transnational feminist perspective. I use the What’s the Problem Represented to Be?-approach to the interrogation of a selection of US policy documents. The research question of the paper is as follows: Can this policy be regarded as feminist empowerment? Or is it rather organized according to the logic of masculinist protection?

Lobbying in the dark? : the effects of policy-making transparency on interest group lobbying strategies in France and Sweden
Policy makers need information about the potential consequences of their policies; this provides an opening for interest groups, who have on-the-ground information about likely outcomes if those policies are implemented. However, we cannot simply assume that interest groups also have information about what is going on in the policy process and what policy makers actually need at any given moment, especially since such information is not necessarily automatically available, nor easy to gather, even for actors with formal roles in the policy process. Thus, I argue that the transparency of the policy process is a critical variable for understanding interest group lobbying behavior. Specifically, I define transparency as the release of actionable information during the policy process; for transparency to be useful to interest groups, information about that process must be released before it is needed to make strategic decisions. In a high- transparency policy process, information is released early and systematically; groups, then, can be reasonably certain they know what is going on and can pursue ad hoc lobbying strategies on a case-by-case basis. A low- transparency process, on the other hand, releases its information at the discretion of policy-makers; while some groups may get some information, they have no guarantee that they have all the information they need at any given moment. Thus, these groups will need to pursue mitigating strategies to avoid the costs of making lobbying decisions under uncertainty. Using interviews, content analysis, and a case study, I compare the lobbying strategies of interest groups active in forestry policy in low- transparency France and high-transparency Sweden. These comparisons show that groups adapt their strategies to the level of transparency in their countries. Swedish groups pursue ad-hoc strategies, selecting lobbying actions on a case-by-case basis, with little concern for costly lobbying errors or last-minute policy surprises. French groups, on the other hand, pursue strategies to increase their chances of getting information about the policy process; to decrease their chances of making costly lobbying errors; and to increase their chances of responding effectively to last-minute policy surprises

Tricontinental Routes of Solidarity: Stokely Carmichael in Cuba
Stokely Carmichael’s visit to Cuba for three weeks in the summer of 1967 illustrates a convergence in the transnational routes of the African American freedom struggle and the Cuban Revolution. African American activists saw Cuba as a model for resisting US power, eradicating racism, and enacting societal change, while the Cuban government considered African Americans allies against US imperialism and advocates of Cuba’s antiracist stance. Amidst racial violence in the United States and Cuba’s efforts to inspire revolution, Carmichael’s presence at the Organization of Latin American Solidarity conference in Havana—and in particular his interactions with Fidel Castro—caused ripples worldwide. A shared “tricontinental” vision that promoted unity in the Global South against imperialism, capitalism, and racism facilitated Carmichael’s solidarity with Castro. Yet divergent views on the role of race in fighting oppression limited their solidarity. Carmichael and Castro’s spectacular alliance demonstrated their personal affinity and ideological commonalities but did not result in an institutional alliance between the black liberation movement and the Cuban state. Instead Carmichael’s connection with the Cuban Revolution left an underexplored legacy. Examining Carmichael’s visit to Cuba illustrates the possibilities and pitfalls of transnational solidarity and furthers our understanding of postwar struggles for change.

Making Legal: The Dream Act, Birthright Citizenship, and Broad-Scale Legalization
Some of the most controversial topics in immigration and citizenship law involve granting lawful immigration status—or citizenship itself—to persons who might otherwise be in the United States unlawfully. In this Article, I examine arguments for and against three ways to confer lawful status: (1) the DREAM Act, which would grant status to many unauthorized migrants who were brought to the United States as children; (2) the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, under which almost all children born on U.S. soil are U.S. citizens; and (3) broad-scale proposals to grant lawful immigration status to a substantial percentage of the current unauthorized population. I first explain how arguments both for and against the DREAM Act reflect some mix of fairness and pragmatism. Though birthright citizenship seems different from the DREAM Act, the arguments are similar. I next show that although children figure much more prominently in the DREAM Act and birthright citizenship, similar patterns of argument apply to broad–scale legalization, and the arguments in favor are just as strong. Finally, I explain that the “rule of law” is a highly malleable concept that provides no persuasive case against any of these ways to confer lawful immigration or citizenship status. Rule of law arguments in favor of conferring status are stronger than rule of law arguments against doing so.

Strengthening State Capabilities: The Role of Financial Incentives in the Call to Public Service
We study a recent recruitment drive for public sector positions in Mexico. Different salaries were announced randomly across recruitment sites, and job offers were subsequently randomized. Screening relied on exams designed to measure applicants' intellectual ability, personality, and motivation. This allows the first experimental estimates of (i) the role of financial incentives in attracting a larger and more qualified pool of applicants, (ii) the elasticity of the labor supply facing the employer, and (iii) the role of job attributes (distance, attractiveness of the municipal environment) in helping fill vacancies, as well as the role of wages in helping fill positions in less attractive municipalities. A theoretical model guides each stage of the empirical inquiry. We find that higher wages attract more able applicants as measured by their IQ, personality, and proclivity towards public sector work – i.e., we find no evidence of adverse selection effects on motivation; higher wage offers also increased acceptance rates, implying a labor supply elasticity of around 2 and some degree of monopsony power. Distance and worse municipal characteristics strongly decrease acceptance rates but higher wages help bridge the recruitment gap in worse municipalities.

A Study of Classic Maya Rulership
Classic period Maya rulers are often reduced to "ideal types" and are discussed in terms that would suggest they were a homogenous group of individuals cut from the same cloth. Contrary to that assumption, this study employs epigraphic, iconographic, archaeological, ethnohistoric and ethnographic data to demonstrate there was significant local and regional variation in the way kingship was expressed through artistic programs, calendrics, ritual activity, accoutrements of power, sacred warfare, the taking of theophoric throne names and titulary, and the composition and adaptation of local pantheons. The identity of each polity was inseparably connected with that of its ruler, and variations on the rulership theme served to reinforce their unique identity in the larger landscape vis-à-vis other polities. The underlying theoretical approach relies on concepts of mimesis and alterity, duality, and complementary opposition, all of which are creative acts which serve to establish a sense of Self in contrast to the Other, both human and divine. This study also examines concepts of divine kingship and deification, and argues that rulers were "functionally divine" while living and were elevated to "ontologically divine" status upon becoming apotheosized ancestors after death. As apotheosized ancestors, they took their place in the pliable local pantheon which further reinforced the unique identity of each site.

Although both populations were severely reduced by whaling, the eastern population is generally considered to have recovered while the western population has remained highly depleted. This study expanded on previous work supporting differentiation between eastern and western populations using mtDNA and utilized a panel of 13 microsatellite loci to provide additional insight into the population structure of gray whales. Comparison of microsatellite allele frequencies indicated that eastern and western populations are genetically distinct. Although highly statistically significant, the level of nuclear differentiation between the two populations was relatively low, and the results of sex-specific analyses and assignment testing suggested that some degree of male- biased dispersal may occur between populations. Within the set of samples collected from animals on the primary western feeding ground, relatedness analyses revealed that, consistent with field observations, the fidelity of females and their offspring to this area have been important in shaping the structure of the population. Furthermore, analysis of the paternity of animals first identified as calves, with known and sampled mothers, in the western population between 1995 and 2007 identified 18 males as putative fathers, providing evidence that many of the animals identified on the Sakhalin feeding ground interbreed with each other, presumably while sharing a common migratory route. However, the success of the paternity assignment was lower than expected given the high proportion of sampled animals in this population, suggesting that some males which are contributing to reproduction may not use the primary western feeding ground on a regular basis. The combination of these results suggests that the population structure of gray whales in the North Pacific is more complex than previously thought, and that some movements between the eastern and western populations may take place. However, the maintenance of genetic differences between the two populations supports their recognition as separate eastern and western populations. Future efforts should focus on elucidating the nature and extent of any dispersal which is occurring in order to better understand factors potentially influencing the recovery of the small western population

Young children selectively seek and offer help when solving problems
This dissertation investigated whether young children are sensitive to psychological cues in their social-learning partners when solving problems. Two groups of children age 20-24 and 32-36 months were presented with problem-solving situations involving toys and could interact with social learning partners who differed along the dimensions of competency and social availability. In Experiment 1, children age 20-24 months selectively sought help from a social learning partner who was high along both dimensions of competency and social availability. Experiment 2 demonstrated that by age three children not only selectively seek help from a competent and highly socially available partner, but also that some children (25%) now reliably offer help to a partner who lacks competency and social availability. Experiment 3 explored the relative impact of social availability and competency on young children's (20-24 months) selective help-seeking. Condition A served as an attempt to replicate experiment 1; in three additional conditions, children's social learning partners now exhibited novel combinations of traits along dimensions of social availability and competency. In one condition, each experimenter had one positive and one negative trait ; in two further conditions experimenters were equally high or low, respectively, along the dimension of social availability and differed only with respect to how competent they were at the task. Results replicated the findings from Experiment 1, as children preferred to seek help from a competent and socially available experimenter when she was pitted against someone lacking these traits. Children failed to show any selective help-seeking or -offering in the three remaining conditions when the contrast between experimenters was less salient. We failed to find any reliable evidence of spontaneous selective help-offering in Experiment 3.This suggests that around age 2, salient contrasts are required to elicit selective help-seeking in children. These findings are the first to suggest that young children selectively engage with social learning partners when solving problems. We discuss possible underlying causes for these constraints on selective help- seeking and propose future studies to further track the developmental trajectory of selective help-seeking and - offering during young childhood

"What a delicious, what a malicious imputation!"  Gender and Politics in the Reception of Elizabeth Maconchy's <italic>The Sofa</italic>
Despite being hailed as one of the finest composers of her day, Elizabeth Maconchy (1907-1994) and her music are unaccountably neglected today.  While Maconchy remains best-known for her orchestral works and cycle of thirteen string quartets, in the late 1950s her compositional career moved in another direction, and she composed three one-act operas between 1956 and 1961:  <italic>The Sofa</italic> (1956-1957), <italic>The Three Strangers</italic> (1957-1958), and <italic>The Departure</italic> (1960-1961).  Her first opera, <italic>The Sofa</italic>, stands out as an anomaly.  Based on the libertine novel <italic>Le Sopha, conte moral</italic> (1742) by Claude Prosper Jolyot de Cr&eacute;billon (1707-1777), the opera's racy subject matter, with a libretto by Ursula Vaughan Williams represents a stark departure from the more serious themes of her other works.  <italics>The Sofa</italics>'s critical reception is enlightening not only for reactions to the opera's risque subject matter, but also for the general reactions to Maconchy's music.  Why did the prewar years prove to be more favorable for Maconchy, as contrasted with the comparatively indifferent reception accorded to her music during the war and after?  While gender discrimination is often cited as the primary reason for this neglect, this supposition does not satisfactorily account for her marked early success.  There is no doubt that Maconchy was discriminated against on the basis of her gender, as were many of her peers.  However, the nature of her reception both during and after the war requires that one look beyond the strict binaries of gender in order to understand not only the complexities of gender politics in the British musical establishment of the last century, but also how the changing political climate came to greatly affect the marketability of her music.

Transportation Barriers to Employment: Southeast Asian Welfare Recipients in Los Angeles and Fresno Counties
As a result of the recent restructuring of the U.S. welfare system, millions of welfare recipients have entered the paid labor market. In response, public agencies have established programs to transition recipients into the labor market or else risk dramatic increases in poverty. While access to transportation affects welfare recipients’ ability to find and retain employment, relatively little is known about the relationship between transportation and welfare usage, particularly among ethnic and racial subgroups of the population.
      This study relies on survey data from two California counties, Los Angeles and Fresno to examine the travel patterns and barriers of welfare recipients across racial and ethnic groups, focusing specifically on the transportation issues facing Southeast Asians. The findings show that Southeast Asian welfare recipients are more—not less—reliant on automobiles for their travel than other racial and ethnic groups. While this finding might suggest that low-income Southeast Asian families do not face transportation difficulties, evidence from the surveys show otherwise. Some Southeast Asian households do not have automobiles. Moreover, Southeast Asian respondents reported the greatest difficulty with their travel largely because they face numerous auto-related transportation problems, the most apparent is the age of their vehicles. Two-thirds of auto-owning Southeast Asian respondents owned vehicles that were over ten years old and 61 percent had trouble maintaining their vehicles.
      The findings of this study suggest that policies to facilitate the economic incorporation of low-income families—including Southeast Asian households—must include efforts to facilitate access to automobiles and, in particular, access to reliable vehicles. For Southeast Asian recipients living in dense urban areas, transit agencies must devote greater attention to providing language assistance to those with limited English language proficiency. Finally, additional data are needed to better understand the travel patterns and barriers of Southeast Asians and to evaluate existing programs to meet their transportation needs.

Parent smoker role conflict and planning to quit smoking: a cross-sectional study
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Role conflict can motivate behavior change. No prior studies have explored the association between parent/smoker role conflict and readiness to quit. The objective of the study is to assess the association of a measure of parent/smoker role conflict with other parent and child characteristics and to test the hypothesis that parent/smoker role conflict is associated with a parent&#8217;s intention to quit smoking in the next 30&#160;days. As part of a cluster randomized controlled trial to address parental smoking (Clinical Effort Against Secondhand Smoke Exposure&#8212;CEASE), research assistants completed exit interviews with 1980 parents whose children had been seen in 20 Pediatric Research in Office Settings (PROS) practices and asked a novel identity-conflict question about &#8220;how strongly you agree or disagree&#8221; with the statement, &#8220;My being a smoker gets in the way of my being a parent.&#8221; Response choices were dichotomized as &#8220;Strongly Agree&#8221; or &#8220;Agree&#8221; versus &#8220;Disagree&#8221; or &#8220;Strongly Disagree&#8221; for the analysis. Parents were also asked whether they were &#8220;seriously planning to quit smoking in 30&#160;days.&#8221; Chi-square and logistic regression were performed to assess the association between role conflict and other parent/children characteristics. A similar strategy was used to determine whether role conflict was independently associated with intention to quit in the next 30&#160;days.
				
				
					
						Methods
					As part of a RTC in 20 pediatric practices, exit interviews were held with smoking parents after their child&#8217;s exam. Parents who smoked were asked questions about smoking behavior, smoke-free home and car rules, and role conflict. Role conflict was assessed with the question, &#8220;Please tell me how strongly you agree or disagree with the statement: &#8216;My being a smoker gets in the way of my being a parent.&#8217; (Answer choices were: &#8220;Strongly agree, Agree, Disagree, Strongly Disagree.&#8221;)
				
				
					
						Results
					Of 1980 eligible smokers identified, 1935 (97%) responded to the role-conflict question, and of those, 563 (29%) reported experiencing conflict. Factors that were significantly associated with parent/smoker role conflict in the multivariable model included: being non-Hispanic white, allowing home smoking, the child being seen that day for a sick visit, parents receiving any assistance for their smoking, and planning to quit in the next 30&#160;days. In a separate multivariable logistic regression model, parent/smoker role conflict was independently associated with intention to quit in the next 30&#160;days AOR 2.25 (95% CI 1.80-2.18).
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					This study demonstrated an association between parent/smoker role conflict and readiness to quit. Interventions that increase parent/smoker role conflict might act to increase readiness to quit among parents who smoke.
				
				
					
						Trial registration
					Clinical trial registration number: NCT00664261.

Social Experience and Physiology: Effects of Social Relationship Qualities on Allostatic load
The aim of this dissertation is to better understand how the quality of social experience is related to allostatic load (AL), an index of cumulative dysregulation across physiological systems.  More specifically, the project examines the effects of support and negativity from several sources on AL in a large community sample of middle-aged and older adults from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study (N = 949, age 34-84). Results indicated that higher levels of negativity across the social network and lower levels of support from a spouse were each associated with higher AL, controlling for age and relevant demographic and health covariates.  There was evidence that the effects of both network support and negativity varied by age, such that the association between social relationship quality and AL became weaker with age.  This study is the first to demonstrate associations between social relationships and AL in a sample of adults representing five decades of adulthood, rather than in a limited range of older adulthood. In addition, this study extends previous work by testing for independent effects of support and negativity from specific sources.  Taken together, these findings provide support for theoretical formulations arguing that AL is a pathway linking the quality of social relationships with morbidity and mortality.

Grassroots cosmopolitanism : transnational communication and citizenship practices among indigenous Mexican immigrants in the United States
This dissertation explains "citizenship" as a practice and a tradition, rather than as a concept describing exclusive belonging to a political community. Immigration is commonly a condition of exclusion from citizenship in our contemporary world, as gender and slavery, have been in the past. Usually, immigrants have to comply with a subtractive model of citizenship and forgo their attachments to their homeland and mother language in order to be part of the new, dominant culture. This model is not smooth, and almost always entails hegemonic, or even violent practices of control from the state institutions either against the first, second, or even third generation. It is precisely from the point of view of immigrants that this exclusivity is challenged, and this work focuses on transnational citizenship and communication practices of indigenous Mexican immigrants in the United States as examples for the construction of a more cosmopolitan citizenship. Those practices offer a good example of how cosmopolitan engagement across nations is constructed from below, enriching instead of limiting the conception of citizenship. Using historical research, ethnography, and content analysis, I examine how transnational citizenship and communication practices among indigenous Mexicans living in California and organizing across borders, are transforming into cosmopolitan citizenship, engaging at least two nation- states along with international organizations into their daily lives. I study the case of one pan-ethnic and multi- site organization primarily composed of indigenous Mexicans from the state of Oaxaca named Indigenous Front of Binational Organizations (FIOB). A content analysis of two indigenous immigrant media is also included, reflecting this cosmopolitan engagement

Killing Me Softly: Remembering and Reproducing Violence in Southeast Asian Refugees (Two Times)
This thesis examines the ways in which Southeast Asian refugee narratives have been produced and replicated through institutions for the purpose of supporting legitimizing and justifying U.S. imperialism and war violence. It interrogates the limitations of institutionalized modes of memorialization and seeks to offer new forms of remembering and circumventing narratives of remembering. Furthermore, it seeks to connect different forms of state violence together to yield a greater analysis and understanding of the ways in which violence affects the lives of Southeast Asian refugees through an analysis of cultural productions and narrative practices. This project serves to highlight what is forgotten when refugees and domestic violence survivors remember and the connectedness and intricacy of various forms of U.S. imperialism and state violence.

Bringing in Gangs and Community: A Re-Evaluation of Social Disorganization and Collective Efficacy
For the last two decades, social disorganization and collective efficacy have been two of the main tenants of criminological thinking.  Although gaps in these theories have been pointed out during the past decade, these theories persisted in the criminological literature.  Further, these theories have been used as the bases for models of intervention, prevention, and suppression to reduce crime and juvenile delinquency.  These programs have had mixed results because they do not account for previously mentioned gaps.  Thus, until we improve upon the current theory criminology will not be effective at explaining or reducing criminal behavior.This dissertation takes attempts to take a step towards addressing these gaps, and including the implications of these gaps in the statistical analyses presented here.  These critiques include the role of the built environment and deviant places (Stark 1987); social and economic capital within poor communities (Venkatesh 2000; Patillo-McCoy 1998); and individual perceptions of public safety (Glassner 2010). Findings in this dissertation show that these factors influence criminal behavior more than classical measures of social disorganization and structural disadvantage.  Additionally, this study finds that informal groups, and illicit activities play a role in social control and supplementing the local economy. This study suggests that more research is needed in the area of social ecology and criminal behavior which takes into account these critiques.  Specifically, more research is needed on the interaction between individual perception of social space and factors occurring within that space.  Additionally, more thought needs to be put into urban and community planning to address the role of deviant spaces within the urban space.

Non aliud iure dici debeamus quam Christiani: Heresy and Orthodoxy, Catholicity and Schism in the Late Fourth Century
The Luciferians, a group of orthodox Christians emerging during the Arian crisis of the 4th century, stood in a unique position in early Christianity. Scholars have long-described them as "Nicene radicals," and ancient authors described them variously as catholic, schismatic, or heretical. An examination of the Luciferians and their opponents reveals that the Luciferians were no more or less radical than their contemporaries. Instead, the Luciferian group formed for other, primarily social, reasons. The emergence and development of the Luciferian group demonstrates the inherent drive towards the formation of rhetorical boundaries over theology where conceptual boundaries may not have truly existed, and also the porosity of said boundaries. The decline of the group suggests that while reification of boundaries may be necessary for the longetivity of a given group, it is not sufficient for a group's survival given other social factors. In the appendices, a translation is provided of the Luciferian <italic>Confessio Fidei</italic> and their petition, the <italic>Libellus Precum</italic>, for which no English translation has been published previously, as well as a translation of Theodosius' response, the <italic>Lex Augusta</italic>.

Spatial Mismatch or Automobile Mismatch? An Examination of Race, Residence and Commuting in US Metropolitan Areas
This paper uses data from the metropolitan samples of the American Housing Survey in 1977-78 and 1985 to examine the commute patterns of whites, blacks and Hispanics in US metropolitan areas, with a particular focus on the commutes of workers living in predominantly minority residential areas. Overall, the commute patterns of white and minority workers appear to be converging rather than diverging over time, even among low-skilled workers. Contrary to the spatial mismatch hypothesis, black and Hispanic workers living in minority areas had both shorter commutes and commutes that increased more slowly between 1977-78 and 1985 compared to workers in other areas. Further, a longitudinal analysis shows that the average commute times of non-moving minority workers in predominantly minority areas decreased during the study period. We find no evidence in these commuting data to support the spatial mismatch hypothesis.

Los Sonidos del cine: Cinematic Music in Mexican Film, 1930-1950
Mexican expressive culture in the twentieth century - from the murals of David Alvaro Siqueiros and Diego Rivera to the music of Carlos Chávez and Silvestre Revueltas - was key in constructing nationalist identity; in particular, Mexican cinema during 1930-1950 aided in creating new social identities specific to post-Revolutionary Mexican society.  The period witnessed the formation and institutionalization of several film genres, the creation of a star system paralleling Hollywood's, and successful domestic and international reception.  An area that has not been thoroughly investigated is music and its contributions to nascent cinematic nationalism. This dissertation proposes an interdisciplinary investigation of music in Mexican cinema between 1930-1950, concentrating on how orchestral and popular music contributed to creating or enhancing cinematic representations of national identity.  I examine several film examples from prominent genres developed during this period, such as the prostitute melodrama and the cabaretera subgenre, the indigenista film (films focusing on an indigenous population), cine de añoranza porfirana (films of Porfirian longing), and the comedia ranchera (ranch comedy).  While diverse in narrative and structure, these genres emblematize a nationalist consciousness through tropes that paralleled the constantly changing perspectives in state ideologies on international affairs, popular and transnational culture, and domestic modernization.  Music in these films embellished and amplified the varying and evolving constructions of identity.  Because of the important role film has in the construction of Mexican national identity during this period, examining the film's musical track provides a fruitful avenue for new interpretations that have gone unnoticed.

Researching and Learning from Undocumented Young Adults
Over the years, I have learned to think of research as a collective project where communities give us information for our research and we seek appropriate outlets for putting our research products back into the communities. While scholars talk about this form of reciprocity, we don’t always think about the ways in which our research and our research participants can also change and affect us as individuals. While my research has led to a wealth of significant findings about the lives of undocumented young adults, it has also taught me a lot about my own life. Talking to countless undocumented young adults about concepts of citizenship, membership, and rights has taught me a lot about the significance of citizenship in my own life. I share three of these lessons from the field with you now in hopes that their experiences will transform your conceptions of citizenship as much as they have transformed mine.

The Geographical Distribution of Nonprofit Human Service Organizations and Neighborhood Characteristics
The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between neighborhoods and nonprofit human service organizations (NHSOs) located within these neighborhoods.  Specifically, this study focuses on examining how the capacity of NHSOs--the density of NHSOs and the NHSOs' expenditure per capita--in neighborhoods is related to neighborhood characteristics. Based on a theoretical framework explaining need and supply for NHSOs, this study includes heterogeneity, disadvantaged population, neighborhood wealth, social capital and religious participation as factors related to NHSO capacity.  In addition, this study also tests whether a specific segment of the population--child and youth population--is positively related with the capacity of NHSOs primarily serving this specific group of the population.Combining a population NHSO dataset with two different neighborhood datasets in Los Angeles County, a series of regression analyses were conducted to test the above hypotheses. The key findings indicate that the less heterogeneous in age, more heterogeneous in education, more people in poverty, lower level of combined social support, social cohesion, and informal social control, and more religious residents within a neighborhood, the greater the density of NHSOs.  In addition, the less heterogeneous in age, more people in poverty, lower level of combined social support, social cohesion, and informal social control, more residents' neighborhood organization participation, and more religious residents within a neighborhood, the greater the NHSOs' expenditure per capita.  Particularly, regarding the NHSOs mainly serving child and youth population, this study also found that the smaller the share of the child and youth population within a neighborhood, the greater the density of child and youth NHSOs, and the greater the child and youth NHSOs' expenditure per capita.These results suggest that while the theoretical framework can explain a part of the relationships between NHSO capacity and neighborhood characteristics, it cannot clearly demonstrate other associations.  Considering that many neighborhood characteristics contain multiple or opposite meanings in terms of NHSO capacity, a more detailed theorization is needed to precisely understand the geographical distribution of NHSOs.

Transit, Density, and Residential Satisfaction
Planners and others have proposed developing high-density residential nodes around transit stations to reduce auto dependence and encourage transit use. Such nodes, the argument goes, would provide more patrons for the transit system, more shoppers for nearby stores, and more of a community for the residents. However, such high-density housing runs counter to the assumed American preference for low-density, detached homes. This study investigates the relationship between residential density and housing satisfaction. It also examines the extent to which other factors, such as proximity of the residential development to transit and respondent background variables, influence this relationship.
      Data were collected through the presentation of computer-simulated slides to respondents in two urban areas in California. Slides of residential developments of various densities were overlaid on slides of four different settings, two settings next to transit stations and two next to freeway interchanges. Respondents indicated levels of satisfaction with each slide, selected slides they most and least liked, identified housing and neighborhood attributes and other factors associated with their selections, and provided information on their travel behavior and socioeconomic and demographic variables.
      High-density housing was strongly disliked by a large majority of respondents. However, this reaction was affected by various design features. Housing near transit was generally preferred to housing near freeways. Familiarity with and proximity to sites used in the study did not influence satisfaction ratings. Certain respondent variables did influence the satisfaction-density relationship, including age, income, and presence or absence of children.
      These results suggest that the desire for single-family detached housing is still quite strong, although not absolute. The concluding section discusses some reasons for this, including cultural norms that confer status and social position on owners of a single-family house with a yard and federal policies that support purchases of single-family detached housing, particularly in suburban areas. Planners and others concerned with increasing residential densities around transit stations should recognize these factors in their planning efforts. Recommendations stemming from this work include utilizing what has been learned about reducing perceived densities while maintaining relatively high objective densities, and identifying and designing high-density living for selected submarkets, such as younger residents, lower-income residents, and households without children.

[neighborhood, mismatch, spatial, urban, community]

Spatial and Transportation Mismatch in Los Angeles
One of the most salient characteristics of poor urban neighborhoods is poor labor-market outcomes. Since its conceptualization in the late 1960's, the spatial mismatch hypothesis (SMH) has been cited to explain the employment problems encountered by residents of disadvantaged urban communities. Scholars have noted an increasing geographic separation between job opportunities and low-income minorities, many of whom have remained trapped in inner-city ghettos and barrios while jobs have decentralized into the suburbs. Physical distance, then, has been recognized as an employment barrier. Spatial mismatch has also been tied to the development of underclass neighborhoods - those where at least two-fifths of the residents fall below the poverty line. These communities have experienced an exodus of the middle-class, which in turn has weakened community institutions and social networks, created a paucity of positive role models, and devastated neighborhood economies. Empirical studies have found that spatial mismatch adversely impacts labor-market outcomes for African Americans in older cities, but the hypothesis may not be relevant for all disadvantaged urban neighborhoods.

Outsider politics : radicalism as a political strategy in Western Europe and Latin America
This dissertation studies the dynamics of political competition from an outsider's perspective across contemporary democracies. Due to differences in the initial conditions of competition, not all political parties possess the same resources nor can they all follow the same strategies to obtain votes. Outsider political parties are those who are neither in executive government nor traditional opposition parties but, rather, they are clearly excluded from mainstream politics because they fail to fall neatly within the Left-Right political continuum. In order to break into their party system and gain power, some outsider parties choose radicalism as a strategy of entry and of persuasion. To become radical, outsider parties introduce a new, neglected or forgotten issue dimension into the political arena and with it, they question the validity of the entire establishment. Thus, radicalism allows outsiders to differentiate themselves from all other actors, to challenge the terms in which politics takes place and, ideally, to reshape their particular political system in order to abandon their condition of permanent losers. I first describe and explain my theory of radicalism. I dispute the conventional wisdom which defines it as an extremist or fundamentalist, ideological choice and present radicalism as an instrumental tactic dependent on the actual nature of the establishment and the specific moment in which such strategic choice was made. I then rely on two different expert surveys to empirically distinguish amongst the established, the outsider and the radical parties and continue to compare and contrast them in a cross-sectional study of 30 liberal democracies and 247 political parties. Finally, I trace the particular evolution -- through time and space-- of the radical strategy in four case studies in two Western European countries and two Latin American. My findings reveal first that radicalism is, indeed, a strategy available only for outsider parties. Second, that it is a response to a rigid party system. Third, that it relies on a trial and error process for selecting the "right" issue dimension and that such a selection process is endogenous and party-leadership driven

Grace Palacio Arceneaux, a Mexican-American resident of Watsonville, California, was interviewed in 1977 by Meri Knaster, an editor at the Regional History Project, as part of a series of oral histories documenting local agricultural and ethnic history.
      Arceneaux was born in San Martin de Bolaños, Jalisco, Mexico, in March 1920. She came with her family to San Juan Bautista, California, in 1923 during the havoc of the Mexican Revolution. The family lived on a little ranch and eked out a living farming and doing field work. Her mother died in childbirth when she was a young girl, and shortly thereafter her father died, leaving Arceneaux to care for her nine brothers and sisters. As she said, she always had a child to carry on her hip, wherever she went.
      Not only did her parents not speak English, they did not want it spoken in the house; Arceneaux and her siblings translated for their parents, for their father's business deals and jobs. She attended school through the fifth grade and returned to school many years later, when she was in her forties, to obtain her high school diploma at Watsonville night school, and earned a degree at Cabrillo College. Knaster wrote in her notes of these interviews: “All those years of no schooling are not manifested in either her manner of speaking or vocabulary-- she's a very articulate woman.”
      After her father died, Arceneaux hired out her family as a unit, working in the fields around San Juan Bautista whenever possible, and doing whatever else was available, keeping the county from separating her siblings and putting them in foster homes. Because of serious, recurring bouts of tuberculosis, she spent several years in sanitariums and was no longer able to do fieldwork due to the permanent damage to her health.
      Her narrative is rich in recollections of local history, of the Mexican and Filipino communities and their customs and inter-relationships. She was married at one time to a Filipino farmworker and so became a member of that community, as well. She also discusses the life of field workers, harvesting garlic and various other crops, and the role of labor contractors in agriculture. The period she spent among Filipinos is rich with details about a side of Watsonville life that is not well documented-- Chinatown, gambling, and prostitution.
      Her spirit of grit and determination shines through her descriptions of chronic hard times and poverty as she worked unremittingly to raise her siblings and to make a life for herself. Her life story shows how she made the transition from illegal immigrant farmworker to middle-class social activist.
      She speaks movingly of her marriages, work life, her precarious financial situation, and the importance of her Catholicism, as she her evolved from an unquestioning Catholic into her own self-defined understanding of her religion as it embraced activism and equality.
      As a mature woman she returned to school, and discovered the world of books and ideas, and gained confidence in her abilities to speak and think critically about the condition of her community, and its political and cultural marginalization. This in turn led to her involvement in community issues during which she became one of the first Mexican-American women in the Pajaro Valley to fight for bilingual education, outreach services for poor women, victims of domestic violence, and those seeking to gain educations for themselves.
      Knaster noted many small, telling details of Arceneaux's life when she interviewed her in her home in Watsonville. She wrote: "there is a nice back yard, where she hung laundry on her clothesline after one interview. We met in the kitchen, a remodeled expanded, large room, with a view of the yard through sliding glass doors, a room full of light, spacious. Grace always kept her hands busy-- she's one of those women whose work is never done because she does so much and is so industrious, never wasting a moment. She would wash and dry the dishes, pair socks that she had removed from the dryer or fold cloth napkins. Another time she worked on a quilt she had gotten from someone who had died. It was too big for their bed so she removed the trim and sewed as we talked."
      Knaster noted that in the background of the tape recordings you can often hear a tea kettle whistling, or water running as she washes dishes, as Grace's voice moves back and forth according to the activity she is engaged in. Sometimes she would get up from the kitchen table to demonstrate something-- how she used to work in the garlic fields, or how she would carry a little brother or sister on her hip. She would unabashedly let tears flow when relating especially emotional episodes in her life, lifting up her glasses as she wiped away the tears.
      Knaster characterized Arceneaux as a wonderfully warm, sharing, open person, and extremely informative as well. Despite the hardships in her life, her narration is not bitter or resentful. As her conversation reveals, she has a realistic understanding of ethnic and gender discrimination as it is manifest in the Mexican, Anglo, and Filipino communities, having experienced them herself as a single woman, a Mexican, and later as the wife of a Filipino with a Filipino/Mexican child. Her observations of ethnic and class distinctions in the agricultural communities of San Juan Bautista and Watsonville are a real contribution to the social history of this region.

Enhancing the Effects of Happiness-Boosting Activities: The Role of Autonomy Support in an Experimental Longitudinal Intervention
Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of positive activities to enhance well&ndash;being (see Sin & Lyubomirsky, 2009, for a meta-analysis), but an inexpensive, standardized approach to optimizing the success of such activities has yet to be developed. A 6&ndash;week randomized experimental longitudinal study tested the effect of supporting the basic human need of autonomy (Deci & Ryan, 2000) on the efficacy of practicing a happiness&ndash;boosting activity (doing acts of kindness). A novel autonomy support manipulation involving weekly electronic messages was developed for this purpose. As predicted, performing acts of kindness while receiving autonomy support was more effective than performing this strategy without autonomy support or focusing on one&rsquo;s academic work (with or without autonomy support). Also, intrinsic motivation was found to underlie the success of autonomously supported acts of kindness. The benefits of providing autonomy&ndash;supportive environments when administering positive interventions in applied settings are discussed.

By the end of 2012, 12 states and the District of Columbia had support for same-sex marriage at or above 50%. Of these 12 states, all currently perform marriages, civil unions, or domestic partnerships for same-sex couples. Thirteen additional states presently are within 5 percentage points of majority support. In the last eight years, every state has increased in its support for marriage for same-sex couples with an average increase of 13.6%. If present public opinion trends continue, another 8 states will be above 50% support by the end of 2014.

Brachiopod paleoecology during Late Paleozoic climate change (Pennsylvanian-Early Permain, Bolivia)
Studies of modern ecological communities demonstrate that climate change may trigger changes in diversity and taxonomic composition; however, these studies are fundamentally limited to short timescales and therefore cannot demonstrate the full impact of major climate change. Understanding the ecological response of marine invertebrate communities to the Late Paleozoic Ice Age (LPIA), the last complete transition from icehouse to greenhouse, can establish a more complete picture of the climate-faunal relationship. We analyzed brachiopod community structure in Moscovian-Sakmarian (mid-Pennsylvanian to Early Permian) samples spanning the greatest extent of the LPIA, collected from four localities of the Copacabana Formation in Bolivia: Ancoraimes, Yaurichambi, Cuyavi, and Yampupata. Cluster analysis reveals three main groups that appear to coincide with pre-, syn-, and post-glacial times. Genus richness was significantly greater in samples during the Asselian glacial episode; however, the difference may be due to a combination of smaller body size and time averaged mixing of genera from different depths during more rapid glacioeustatic sea level change. Genera present in Bolivia consistently had warm-water affinities, even during the main glaciation, but warm-water taxa increased in abundance over time and the samples became increasingly dominated by characteristically North American genera. Overall mean body size and the size of particular genera were smaller in the Asselian cluster. These size changes likely reflect variations in substrate because marine invertebrates should be larger at cooler temperatures due to oxygen limitation at higher temperatures. The monotonic increase in abundance of warm-water genera and increasingly North American biogeographic affinity imply that community change was most likely the result of the northward drift of Bolivia rather than a response to late Paleozoic glacial-nonglacial cycles. This lack of climate related faunal change was probably a result of Bolivia's mid-latitude location during the late Paleozoic because both the rate of temperature change and its magnitude were likely smaller at lower latitudes, reducing the impact of climate change on marine communities.

Emergent conflict behavior : strategic interstate bargaining as an n-player ABM
This dissertation introduces an agent based model driven by the behavioral assumptions of the bargaining theory of war. The model is applied to explain why wars cluster geographically and why democracies do not fight other democracies. Simulation results suggest new explanations for both of these phenomena. The emergence of regionally clustering conflict can be explained by the tendency of shifting power to motivate renegotiation when agents pay costs for projecting power and select their bargaining partners. Regions of democratic peace occur when groups of agents share information more effectively than their competitors. The dissertation develops and validates these theories with statistical analysis of simulation results and case studies

Organizational ecology and population dynamics in politics : an agent-based model
Markets, networks and hierarchies are the three core forms of social organization. They recur at all levels of social interaction as solutions to problems of cooperation. Disparate actors---from states, to "dark'' actors like rebel groups, to voters---use these organizations to solve their cooperative problems. This dissertation uses a general agent-based model (ABM) to examine how organizations affect cooperation and welfare across several issues. Humans form organizations to enhance cooperation and wellbeing. Markets, networks, and hierarchies are the recurrent forms of social organization, but are typically studied in isolation. I use an ABM to look at when different types of actors choose to join (and thereby create) different organizations. The conditions that drive these choices include individual, population, and organizational attributes. Organizations allow for social actors to guard against exploitation, increase the likelihood of cooperation, and by extension increase social welfare. I apply insights from the ABM to three topics: rebel organizations, alliance formation, and voter turnout in emerging democracies. I show rebel organizations form as networks when insurgents think the risks of defection are low, but shift into hierarchic organizations to protect themselves from defection as these risks increase. This finding has implications for counter insurgency policy. I also find that those most vulnerable to exploitation in rebel populations, such as child soldiers with no network to leverage, are more likely to join hierarchies at lower levels of risk than less vulnerable insurgents. Likewise, I apply the model to alliance formation, finding that "nice'' states will join constraining organizations in higher numbers than their "nasty'' counterparts. Finally, I study how voters in emerging democracies will use multiple organizations to promote high levels of turnout---bootstrapping the population into high levels of cooperation through social networks as well as institutional mechanisms. Embracing this multi-organizational approach in consolidating democracies can increase long-term political participation in many areas, both formal and informal

Women playing a man's game : reconstructing ceremonial and ritual history of the Mesoamerican ballgame
In a few rural vicinities of Sinaloa, Mexico, there is a sport played by the Mexican peoples whose roots are embedded in the pre-Hispanic past. It is called ulama, a game in which an eight-pound rubber ball is propelled using either the hip or the forearm. As was custom for many pre-Hispanic cultures and time periods, men are at the forefront of these games; however, recent ethnographic studies have revealed that women have also played ulama since the early nineteenth hundreds. There is also evidence suggesting that women may have played the game in ancient times. Ceramic female ballplayer figurines found in archaeological contexts throughout Mexico help support this theory. Yet, while these ballplayer figurines and ethnographic reports point to the inclusion of women in the rubber ballgame, scholars are still reluctant to address them and continue to treat the game solely as a male activity. This dissertation is dedicated to the study of women ballplayers and the importance of their participation in the modern and ancient rubber ballgame of the Americas. It is a subject of great value that may inform us about the social roles, material practices, and human relationships of past and present Mexican societies. It is also challenging because little or no information is available on women's roles in the game, and ceramic female ballplayers specifically. Nevertheless, with archaeological evidence from past excavations, and ethnographic accounts by past ballgame scholars, as well as my own, I approach the subject through a comprehensive analysis of terracotta figurines, ancient codices, sixteenth century colonial sources, and oral accounts provided by ulama players and community members from Sinaloa. What I intend with this investigation is to contribute to the body of knowledge pioneered by past scholars who have concerned themselves with the marginal treatment of women in Mesoamerican art history. While the hypothesis presented here may not definitely answer all questions that concern women ballplayers, it certainly seeks to produce critical inquiries about the formation of social identities and statuses of women

Their exhortations that he finally live his life in the face of a death sentence, and his resistance to change, becomes a commentary on the ways in which we access our experience of living and dying, and the contemporary moment which defines them both.

.J. Crosetti was the founder of the J.J. Crosetti lettuce growing company in the Pajaro Valley, California, which is still in operation today under his son, J.J. Crosetti, Jr. Crosetti began his career in California agriculture as a contract buyer for the T.J. Horgan Company during the late 1920s and early 1930s, and then worked as a buyer for A. Levy and Sentner Distributors in San Francisco. In 1936 Crosetti founded his own company, growing and shipping lettuce, tomatoes, broccoli, apples and other crops primarily in the Pajaro Valley, but also in Arizona and the Imperial Valley of California. Crosetti describes labor operations and packing and shipping methods, including the details of the development of vacuum cooling. He discusses the Bracero Program and ethnic changes in the agricultural labor force from the 1930s to the 1970s. He describes the development of labor organizing in Central California and his own involvement in union contract negotiations. Crosetti was also active in the Grower Shipper Vegetable Association of Central California for many years, and served on the State Board of Agriculture as an appointee of Governor Edmund G. Brown from 1962-1969. He concludes the volume with a discussion of economic and technological changes in California agriculture and the increasing trend away from family farmers towards conglomerates.

The Relationship of Neighborhood Built Environment Features and Walking
To date, the literature on urban design and walking has often emphasized more macro-scale features, such as block length and number of intersections, that are easier to measure remotely using GIS and or aerial photographs. Urban designers, in contrast, emphasize the importance of micro-scale features in individuals’ use and experience of neighborhood environments. This paper moves beyond examining correlations of individual built environment features and walking, to begin to test proposals about which composite characteristics of the built environment (safety, comfort, etc.) may have the greatest impact on walking. Several urban design characteristics of 11 neighborhoods throughout California were collected. Self-report walking data on the number and types of walking trips were obtained from surveys administered to parents of 3rd-5th graders. Urban design features related to both accessibility and safety affect the amount of walking that adults do in their neighborhood. Grouping related urban design variables into indices provides some clarity as to how the built environment impacts walking. Safety emerges as the most important built environment characteristic (of those tested), related to both destination and recreational walking.

Ruled Legendrian knots and Lagrangian surfaces
We first review some basic facts of contact and symplectic topology. Symplectic cobordisms are the objects that bring these two worlds together: they are symplectic manifolds with contact manifolds as their boundary. Lagrangian submanifolds in a symplectic cobordism limit to Legendrian submanifolds on the boundary. When the symplectic manifold is four-dimensional and the contact manifolds are three- dimensional, the Legendrian submanifolds are knots and links. We review certain restrictions on the classical invariants of such Legendrian knots imposed by the relation of Lagrangian cobordism. Then we specialize to Legendrian knots in the 3-sphere as the boundary of Lagrangian surfaces in the 4-ball. Much of the recent research in this area uses tools related to contact homology. In particular, we explore the notion of a ruling of a Legendrian knot. After defining the ruling polynomial, we show several new ways to compute it, including the extension of a skein relation for ungraded rulings to integer graded rulings. We show how certain kinds of ribbon knots always give rise to rulings. Finally, we construct for any ruled Legendrian knot an immersed Lagrangian surface bounded by the knot

KINSHIP, MARRIAGE AND AGE IN ABORIGINAL AUSTRALIA
McConnell (1930) first described and attempted to explain an “age spiral” in Australian Aboriginal systems of descent, marriage and kinship over eighty years ago. Since then, ethnographic and theoretical research concerning this matter has been sporadic and inconclusive, with societies that display this feature most often being treated as anomalous, transitional, hybrid or aberrant. Atkins (1981) attributed the failure to understand these societies to a lack of realism in the models; specifically to the widely accepted supposition that any ‘normal’ kinship system must entail an infinite or open series of successive genealogical generations each of which is both discrete and closed. Since that supposition can apply only to societies in which mean husband-wife age differences are zero or negligibly small, he suggested that the age spiral, reported in Australian Aboriginal societies where husband-wife age differences generally exceed 14 years, rests on a finite set of open generations rather than an infinite set of closed generations. His proposal means that the concept of generations as an infinite series of discrete, closed strata may not reflect a human universal, but rather may be an example of European ethnocentrism and over-simplification being interpreted mistakenly as self-evident scientific truth.
      This paper compares models of Australian Aboriginal kinship based on traditional generational closure with models based on generational openness as embedded in age spirals or, more accurately, age biased helices. The objective is to salvage generational openness if it has any merit and to reject it if it does not. The research is based on my own and others’ fieldwork as well as archival research and comparative studies of Aboriginal societies in Central Australia, Cape York Peninsula, Arnhem Land and Western Australia. Analytical methods include formal mathematical models; mechanical, statistical and network models; and computer simulations. The approach is primarily nonverbal, demographic and quantitative rather than verbal and cognitive.
       The findings show that open and closed models entail radically different expectations about the structure and operation of Aboriginal societies in areas including but not limited to: genealogical frameworks, language group endogamy and exogamy, inbreeding coefficients, MBD vs. FZD marriage, prescriptive vs. proscriptive marriage rules, directed marriage cycles and classificatory kinship. In addition to comparing the strengths and weaknesses of open and closed models, the paper also evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of open models by themselves, in search of deficiencies that might justify their rejection. Several significant problems are introduced and discussed, but seem not to constitute fatal flaws.
      The findings are likely to be of greater interest to scientists who are concerned with the survival of Aboriginal societies over the last 50 millennia and of lesser interest to those who focus exclusively on structures of systems of kin classification. The impact of these findings on the broad study of Dravidian and Dravidian-like kinship terminologies may be significant, but I am not qualified to investigate that issue and leave it to others. An extended and detailed analysis of relationships between openness and language group exogamy is in preparation.

Why Blue-Collar Blacks Help Less
Why are blue-collar blacks less likely to help jobseekers than jobholders from other ethnoracial groups or even than more affluent blacks? Drawing from in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 97 black and Latino workers at one large, public sector employer, we find that blue-collar black workers both helped less proactively and rejected more requests for assistance than did blue-collar Latino and white-collar black workers. We attribute blue-collar blacks’ more passive engagement to their stronger conviction, born from personal experience, that providing help was too risky and, more often than not, a waste of time. These experiences contributed to their belief that job-finding hardships were less the result of opportunity deficits than deficits in work ethic, a position they then deployed to justify their reluctance to help in the future. We end with a discussion about how prior helping experiences shape beliefs about inequality and inform jobholders’ willingness to help in the future, often to the detriment of disadvantaged black jobseekers.

We investigated this relationship for Russian nouns. Our results suggest that there is an intricate relationship between textual frequency and inflectional syncretism.

Civic Superstructure: A Networked Public Sphere
This thesis’s networked public sphere - the Civic Superstructure - transforms the public sphere by reconsidering the pace and purview of the civic. Contemporary public institutions are typically disconnected and isolated islands dispersed throughout the city. Our fast-paced, plugged-in lifestyle, however, is evermore inconsistent with such inconvenient geographical dispersal. By incorporating isolated public institutions into a networked system, this project provides a connective layer across an existing site and takes advantage of the interstitial zones between private institutions to offer the civic realm in places where you least expect it. This sprawling network acts as a platform for accessing public services and information, while also providing a new common space for the public to meet, to learn, to play and even to protest — in short, to be a public, even in this most unlikely of places rendered newly civic through a combination of digital and physical access.

Sequestration:  An Alternate Mechanism for Anomie
This dissertation introduces the idea of sequestration, or the separation of populations and social resources based on perceived social worth of the populations involved.  I demonstrate the separation of socially valued populations and socially valued resources from those that are not valued using regression methods and data for Los Angeles County in 2000.  I find that significantly more park lands of better quality are allocated for upper middle-class neighborhoods than for the poorer areas.  Significantly more social service facilities are located in lower income areas.  Arrest rates indicate that more active policing patterns are present in areas with higher income and higher rates of home ownership.  Disproportionate monitoring of privileged populations, service centers, and discovered crimes, and profiling by law enforcement help to explain these patterns.  Content analysis using local newspaper coverage of various Los Angeles County communities indicates that news media favors coverage of the higher income populations and ignores the difficulties of life for lower income populations.  The mainstream media is an important instrument by which plausibility structures and elite agendas are disseminated.  Privileged populations display a sense of proprietary ownership of government and its resources.  I introduce a theoretical outline of the manifestations of power in society and qualitatively demonstrate the concepts using examples from local newspaper articles and the historical treatment of Native Americans by the U.S. government.  I argue that U.S. society resembles a "total institution" because institutional resources and political authority are concentrated in very few hands.  I propose that anomie can be conceived as a product of the asymmetric operation of institutions in society which allocates more and better rewards for those with higher social standing and at the same time stigmatize the less powerful populations.  Anomie is seen as a prevalent condition in western society and can be measured by the lack of participation in primary institutions by large segments of the population, as illustrated by low voter turnout, lack of religious affiliation, high rates of non-marriage, and school dropout rates.

The Stacked Bar Model: Japanese-Peruvians' National Ethnic Identities Across Peru, Japan and the United States
This project has two intertwined goals: 1) to understand the formation of Japanese-Peruvians' national ethnic identities across Peru, Japan and the United States of America by analyzing data from 40-indepth interviews with Japanese-Peruvians living the United States, and 2) to develop and explain the Stacked Bar Model of Ethnicities and Ethnic Identities as a new analytical system by which to understand the national ethnic identities of migrants.  In order to do this, Japanese-Peruvians' ethnic identities are treated as working outside of a zero-sum context and shown to function as multiple ordinal variables that can grow and shrink independently of each other.  National ethnic requirements and ethnic othering qualifiers are then identified as ideal types of ethnic traits that govern the identities that are restricted and made available to Japanese-Peruvians in each country.

On Altruists and Egoists in Activity Participation and Travel: Who are they and do they live together?
Formulation and specification of activity analysis models require better understanding of time allocation behavior that goes beyond the more recent within household analyses to understand selfish and altruistic behavior and how this relates to travel behavior. Using data from 1471 persons in a recent two-day time use/activity diary and latent class cluster analysis we identify eleven distinct daily behaviors that span from the intensely self-serving to intensely altruistic. Predicted cluster membership is then used to study within household interactions. The analysis shows strong correlation exists between social role and patterns of altruistic behavior. However, a substantial amount of heterogeneity is also found within social roles. In addition, travel behavior is also very different among altruistic and self-serving time allocation groups. At the household level, a substantial number of households contain persons with similar behavior. Another group of households contains a mix of self-serving and altruistic persons that follow specialized household roles within their households. The majority of households, however, are populated by altruistic persons. Single person households are more likely to be in the self-serving groups but not in their entirety. Altruism at home is directed most often toward the immediate family members. This is less pronounced when we examine altruistic acts outside the home.

Determinants of male involvement in maternal and child health services in sub-Saharan Africa: a review
Abstract
				
				
					
						Introduction
					Male participation is a crucial component in the optimization of Maternal and Child Health (MCH) services. This is especially so where prevention strategies to decrease Mother-to-Child Transmission (MTCT) of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) are sought. This study aims to identify determinants of male partners&#8217; involvement in MCH activities, focusing specifically on HIV prevention of maternal to child transmission (PMTCT) in sub-Saharan Africa.
				
				
					
						Methods
					Literature review was conducted using the following data bases: Pubmed/MEDLINE; CINAHL; EMBASE; COCHRANE; Psych INFORMATION and the websites of the International AIDS Society (IAS), the International AIDS Conference and the International Conference on AIDS in Africa (ICASA) 2011.
				
				
					
						Results
					We included 34 studies in this review, which reported on male participation in MCH and PMTCT services. The majority of studies defined male participation as male involvement solely during antenatal HIV testing. Other studies defined male involvement as any male participation in HIV couple counseling. We identified three main determinants for male participation in PMTCT services: 1) Socio-demographic factors such as level of education, income status; 2) health services related factors such as opening hours of services, behavior of health providers and the lack of space to accommodate male partners; and 3) Sociologic factors such as beliefs, attitudes and communication between men and women.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					There are many challenges to increase male involvement/participation in PMTCT services. So far, few interventions addressing these challenges have been evaluated and reported. It is clear however that improvement of antenatal care services by making them more male friendly, and health education campaigns to change beliefs and attitudes of men are absolutely needed.

What Difference Does it Make? The Impact of Women in Politics in Costa Rica and New Zealand
This project examines the impact of having fewer or more women in national legislatures. Many scholars believe that as women become a greater presence in legislatures, they will pay more attention to women's interests, proposing legislation that reflects the needs of women. Htun states that "the growth in women's presence in legislatures has coincided with important legal advances in women's rights" (Htun 2001). Laws regarding issues important to women -- such as domestic violence, rape, and remedying years of discrimination -- have proliferated in recent years. While the amount of women's issues legislation has increased, there is a question as to whether the relationship between more women in the legislature and the proliferation of female-friendly bills is an automatic  one. Some scholars argue that the number of women in legislatures may increase but "the mere presence of women in positions of power will not automatically produce political outcomes favorable to women's interests"(Htun 2001). Particularly if women continue to constitute only a minority in a legislative body, we should not expect that they would have an overwhelming influence on the political agenda. However, is there a point at which women make up such a large percentage of the legislature that we can assume female-friendly policies will follow? The primary research question of this project is what is the legislative policy impact when women represent a critical minority of 30% or more? Related to the question of what legislative priorities drive women's political decision-making is the question, under which conditions are female legislators most likely to represent women's interests? Existing literature suggests that certain electoral conditions, such as closed-list proportional representation, are most favorable for electing women, but do those same conditions create optimal representation of women? Do women's movements within a country have an impact on legislative policy outputs? These questions will be addressed through an examination of the similarities and differences with regards to women in politics in Costa Rica and New Zealand.

Owning the Revolution: Race, Revolution, and Politics from Havana to Miami, 1959–1963
“Owning the Revolution” explores the role that conversations about race and racism played in defining the 1959 Cuban Revolution both on the island and in South Florida, where over half of the exiles fled. It highlights how revolutionary leaders challenged internal and external opposition movements by publicly labeling dissenters “counterrevolutionaries” and “racists.” Using the label “racist” to attack an opponent was not altogether new in the 1960s, but by linking the term to counterrevolution, national discussions occurring in newspapers, magazines, and on television defined public racism as existing outside of the norms of a new Cuba. Exiles disagreed with this identification and accused the revolution of betraying the nineteenth-century colorblind goals of Jose Martí. Exile leaders in Miami argued that Castro invented racial tensions and claimed that their fight was not with blacks or mulatos but with “red” or communist Cubans. The politics expressed by white exile newspapers, however, did not always fit with the concerns of Afro-Cubans in the United States. Miami Cubans failed to acknowledge the persistence of racism in new exile communities in the same way that the revolutionary government dismissed racism on the island. These parallel silences exemplify the dangers of polarized narratives that imagine the revolution as antiracist and the exile community as racist.

The Porter papers provide an excellent example of how significant archival material can document the life of someone from an underrepresented community and also demonstrate the struggles and achievements of a lesbian whose life spanned almost the entire twentieth century.Margaret Porter was most known for her poetry and for her translations from the French of poetry by Renee Vivien and Natalie Clifford Barney. In addition to Porter’s original and translated poetry, the collection contains her personal diaries, which span over six decades of her life, photographs, and correspondence. In addition, there are materials from her activity in San Diego–based lesbian organizations and documents from her research on Vivien, Barney, and other women in expatriate France.

Which Came First, the Telecommuting or the Residential Relocation? An Empirical Analysis of Causality
Researchers have questioned whether the ability to telecommute is encouraging workers to relocate to more desirable residences farther from work, and in doing so, exacerbate sprawl and increase their net vehicle-miles traveled. The research presented here directly asks, is telecommuting a “friend or foe” of travel-reducing policies? Given that telecommuters tend to have longer commutes than non-telecommuters, is the ability to telecommute prompting workers to move farther away from work? Or rather, does the ability to telecommute allow those who for other reasons have already chosen, or would in any case choose, to live in more distant locations to commute less frequently? These questions are addressed using data collected from more than 200 State of California workers, including current, former, and non-telecommuters. The survey inquired retrospectively about their residential relocations, as well as their telecommuting engagements, over a 10-year period. The results indicate that, as expected, residential moves that are temporally associated with telecommuting episodes tend to increase commute time and length compared to other moves—although the differences are not statistically significant. Analyzing the temporal order of telecommuting engagement and residential relocation, the data show that those who are telecommuting and then move actually tend to relocate closer to their workplace, whereas those who begin telecommuting following a residential relocation tended to have moved much farther from their workplace. Analysis of the stated importance of telecommuting to specific residential relocations did not show a convincing effect toward more distant moves. Thus, the evidence more strongly supports the positive view of telecommuting, that it is ameliorating the negative transportation impacts of moves that occur for other reasons.

A Rua é Nossa (The Street is Ours): In Search of Childhood and Rights on the Streets of Guarulhos, Brazil
This dissertation examines the intersection of agency, subjectivity, and rights among children and adolescents living and working on the streets of Guarulhos, Brazil.  Beginning with the children's descriptions of their living and working conditions, this research situates their knowledge in order to provide a holistic examination of a child's living and working context and conditions.  Their narratives are contextualized within the international discourse on childhood and children's rights.  The major principle of this discourse is that childhood should be safe, carefree, and happy.  Approaches are characterized by a range of appropriate settings, experiences, and relationships that do not apply to all children, particularly poor children.  This project investigates the life course of street and working children; who they are, what brought them to the street, the nature of their work, the conditions they face while on the street, and their decisions to remain on the street or not.  Examining their life course provides essential details to understanding the impact of the political economy on individual lives.  Their subjectivities are contextualized within a political economy of the street and conditions of poverty, violence, and marginalization.  Given their place in society, they are often excluded and constituted as invisible.  As such, the project is an examination of children's agency in actively shaping and transforming their lives.  Drawing on the tensions between structural violence and individual agency, this research creates a space for children's voices regarding their lived experiences, moving them from invisibility in society to active participants in their struggle to live and contribute to our understanding of humanity and human rights.  This project also occurred at a critical time for Brazil, as the country, or select portions of it, is experiencing tremendous economic growth.  Brazil is also actively implementing programs targeted at combating child labor and extreme poverty.  While much has been written about the effects of these government efforts in rural areas, there is a lack of research on their effects in urban settings.  Data collection was ethnographic and relied on qualitative anthropological methodologies that included participant-observation, mapping, life histories, and semi-structured interviews with street and working children in Guarulhos.

A Framework for Analyzing Human Mobility in Online Social Networks
Social networks are becoming one of the most popular forms of communication between individuals worldwide. As more people start to use social networks and post more status updates, more information about the personal lives of individuals begins to leak out into cyberspace. In this thesis, we leverage the power of social networks and their Application Programming Interface (API) to data mine social networks.Many social networks are beginning to add geo location information to status updates to show where users post updates from. Using the geo location information we gathered from Twitter and Foursquare, we are able to analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of individuals. Using studied heuristics, we are able to predict the activity of these individuals. These predictions are perfect for recommendation engines, law enforcement applications, and to track the spread of disease and exposure of harmful pollutants in the atmosphere.We use the spatial and temporal information from the social networks in combination with UCLA's Vehicular Sensor Network. We seek to answer the questions of where people go and how long do they stay in one location. The Vehicular Test-Bed currently deployed in Macao, China tracks the concentration levels of carbon dioxide in the Macao region continuously. Using the social network information, we are able to estimate the exposure of individuals to these harmful pollutants.

Diversity and dynamics of synechococcus populations in the southern California bight
Marine cyanobacteria from the genus Synechococcus are found throughout the world's oceans and as primary producers, they have a significant role in the global carbon cycle. They are also genetically diverse with at least 10 described clades and physiologically diverse capable of motility, using different sources of nitrogen or phosphorus, or modifying the composition of their photosynthetic pigments, for example. As more is learned of their diversity, however, it has become less clear how their genetic diversity reflects their physiological diversity and the ecological niches that they occupy. By developing novel, culture-independent methods, biogeographic patterns were uncovered to provide a framework to link the genetic, physiological, and ecological diversity of marine Synechococcus. Quantitative PCR was used to show that the coastal Southern California Bight is dominated by two Synechococcus clades. Relative to each other, the abundance of these clades varied seasonally indicating that they occupied distinct ecological niches. Synechococcus biogeography was explored further using a novel high-throughput hybridization method (Luminex) to examine the distribution of sub-clades within the two co-existing clades. Even at this scale of diversity, ecological differentiation was apparent. Most interestingly, in mesotrophic environments of the Southern California Bight a sub-clade was abundant in deep water (50 m) while most other sub-clades preferred surface waters. Environmental metagenomic sequences were used to investigate the role of selection in shaping the diversity of Synechococcus populations. The large majority of genes have evolved under purifying selection. Genes that were well represented in environmental populations and may be essential for the population in the coastal Southern California Bight tended to be more evolutionarily conserved. Genes that may have been positively selected were mostly hypothetical genes and were more rare in the environment. For this dissertation, the diversity, biogeography, and evolution of Synechococcus were examined at a level of detail not previously available. The results of this research formed a foundation for further investigations into the genetic and environmental factors regulating the ecological functions and niches of Synechococcus populations. More generally, this research addressed the scales at which bacterial evolution and diversification occur, and how bacterial populations are adapted to their environment

Black Male Dancers and the Performance of Masculinity On- and Offstage: Bill T. Jones, Desmond Richardson, Dwight Rhoden, and Ronald K. Brown
The central premise of this dissertation project is that, contrary to conventional wisdom gay men and their experiences are uniquely situated to tell us about how masculinities are lived in American contemporary culture.  With a critique of hegemonic masculinity at its core, this dissertation project shifts the paradigm on how we think about and perceive men in society and culture.  Attempting to bridge theoretical perspectives with lived reality, my project aims to show the extent to which marginalization of black gay male identity and the black queer male dancing body is critical to understanding the performance of masculinity and how black male dancers inform us about the performance of identity.  Rather than offering gay men's lives as examples of a marginalized identity, my dissertation examines their centrality to understanding men, diverse masculinities, and the performance of gender.  Consequently, the fluidity of gay male identity across race, gender, and sexuality poses compelling reasons to look at gay male lives for unique prescriptions on dealing with and defining masculinities in American contemporary culture.  The dissertation project examines the performance, perception, and representation of masculinity of the black male dancing body.  I confront the prejudice against the male dancer within a Western theatrical dance tradition, while revealing how homosexuality and effeminacy make strange bedfellows in the public-private, on- and offstage perception of male dancers.  Starting with the black male dancer as the focus, my interdisciplinary analysis combines dance studies, black feminist theory, masculinity studies, queer theory, critical race theory, choreographic analysis, oral history, and ethnography to reveal the broad implications of race, gender, and sexuality for men, masculinity, and manhood in American society and culture.  To do so, I examine the work of Bill T. Jones, and the dance companies of co-artistic directors Dwight Rhoden and Desmond Richardson's Complexions Contemporary Ballet, and Ronald K. Brown's Evidence.  I surmise, just as black people are the moral conscience of American democracy and freedom, and that no discussion of American history can occur without their presence; I, too, contend that gay men pose a similar relationship to understanding the performance of gender in society and culture.

The Role of Native Riparian Vegetation in  Resisting Invasion by Giant Reed, Arundo donax
Several decades of giant reed (Arundo donax L.) management in coastal riparian plant communities of southern California have provided many opportunities to observe the long-term trajectories of restoration projects. The two objectives of the current research were 1) to test if invasion resistance to A. donax could be achieved through native restoration, where carbon limitation through shading was the resource limitation facilitating the resistance, and 2) to determine which factors were most important in restoration success of A. donax removal sites. In the first objective, physiological responses of A. donax to shading revealed that a 94% reduction in total plant mass occurred with extreme shade (5% light), where moderate shading (65% light) was found to facilitate plant establishment. Next, a simulated restoration planting tested the effects of competitive shading from two native shrub species on A. donax establishment. Invasion resistance was only found with one species, mulefat (Baccharis salicifolia), and was positively correlated with the level of shade generated. Complete inhibition of establishment was only observed in the oldest and most densely planted competitive environments. These findings were supported in the wildland where under various native riparian competitive canopies mulefat provided the greatest invasion resistance to A. donax establishment. In the second objective, aged A. donax restoration sites (59 total), from 5 to 20 yr since invasive removal, were surveyed across southern California for restoration success. On a regional scale, active restoration provided early, dense native cover and potentially invasion resistant habitats, whereas passive restoration provided delayed native recruitment. Restoration age was positively correlated with native woody cover and negatively with exotic cover for both restoration types, and total species richness was equivalent regionally. Small passive restoration sites found close to the watercourse were most apt to recruit native species and provide successful habitat restoration. Management methods that leave viable A. donax rhizome fragments in Mediterranean riparian plant communities need to insure that fragments are less than 60 g to minimize invasion potential, as propagule size, especially rhizome fragments greater than 240 g, may limit the competitive effects imposed by existing or actively restored native vegetation.

Most histories that examine the development of social insurance programs in the United States have long focused on the efforts of political action groups or government established programs. These histories and studies have ignored the impact of individual based decision making driven by precautionary savings motives, and the life-cycle theory of savings. By examining critical institutional developments both in the private market and public sector we can redefine our understanding of the economic landscape of the late-nineteenth century United States. Civil War pensions and life insurance are understudied institutions. Elderly men in the United States depended and relied on these two different programs to provide for them in old age in an era without Social Security.

7 Myths about Undocumented Immigration
I have spent the last 13 years working with undocumented communities in Los Angeles and have witnessed, time and time again, how the ripple effects of living without formal immigration status can tear apart the lives of some of the people I hold dearest. And so part of my personal, professionaland political life’s work has been to fightalongside undocumented folks in the struggle to gain rights, recognition, and respect. Immigration—especially undocumented immigration—is a loaded topic in this country. The President is talking about it, Members of Congress are debating about it, pundits are complaining about it, and everybody has an opinion about it. However, as I have engaged in this work over the past decade, I have met hundreds of people who are confused and/or misinformed about undocumented immigration, in large part due to negative representations of immigrants in the media. This article attempts to address some of the most common misconceptions about undocumented immigration.

Three Essays on Institutional Reforms in Mexico
This dissertation is comprised of three essays on institutional reforms surrounding marital dissolution, domestic violence and education in Mexico. It is well accepted that a country's economic growth is greatly determined by its ability to innovate and to increase productivity. Understanding the role of family and education policy becomes relevant since there is evidence that domestic violence, divorce and education are linked to labor productivity and other socioeconomic outcomes such as health.Using a difference-in-differences methodology, the second chapter exploits the variation in law adoption across states to estimate the impact of liberalized divorce laws on divorce rates. The findings do not support the claim that greater access to divorce has led to increasing divorce rates.  In addition to the divorce laws examined in the second chapter, the third chapter estimates the impact of legal reforms that make domestic violence a punishable offense and that provide assistance programs to victims of domestic violence.  In intra-household bargaining models, these laws potentially redistribute bargaining power to the victims of domestic violence, which they can use to bargain for less violence. I find that improving the bargaining position through prevention programs and counseling decreases homicides, suicides and bodily injury crimes. Policies which may leave the victim without recourse if separated from the spouse seem to be less effective.The final chapter exploits a quasi-experimental setting to estimate the impact of more instructional days on student performance.  The sources of variation arise from state-mandated changes in test-administration and the start of the school calendar year.  Using an unbalanced panel of all public elementary schools and controlling for a set of school quality measures, the analysis provides evidence to support increasing the number of schools days. The results also suggest that the effects are non-linear and that in impoverished schools, having more days of instruction may be beneficial to the extent that there are other school resources that assist in the production of learning.

Writing Friendship, Mourning the Friend in Late Anglo-Saxon Rules of Confraternity
Mourning the death of a friend posed a problem for late Anglo-Saxon monasticism. Newly reformed under the authority of the Benedictine Rule and the Regularis Concordia, religious were precluded from developing personal friendships so as to protect a world in which all things—including friends—must be held in common. Within this context, two Old English documents, so-called Rules of Confraternity, were inscribed in the early eleventh century into two manuscripts at New Minster, Winchester and Sherborne, establishing provisions for a reciprocal exchange of prayers following a death at a neighboring monastery. However, through scribal amendments and emendations, the Sherborne Rules subtly break apart and reformulate the sense of community upheld in contemporary monastic codes: by liturgically imagining the confraternity as a bond of friendship between two monastic institutions, the Sherborne Rules clear ground for the possibility that one friend might singularly mourn the death of another.

War, Women, and Political Power in Rwanda
What explains the remarkable ascent of women in Rwandan politics? In the first part of my dissertation, I argue that violence can serve as a comprehensive systemic shock that suffices to loosen the hold of strong cultural norms that associate politics with men. It completely dismantles the social and institutional layout of society, and in doing so opens space for women to participate in ways that were previously infeasible. This process starts at the grassroots level: in Rwanda, the disproportionate death, displacement, and imprisonment of men after the genocide meant that women comprised the majority of the population, and 34% of households had no adult male present. This change forced women to take on new roles in their homes and communities, such as rebuilding houses and caring for livestock. It also led to the formation of small self-help associations composed of women who came together to help each other secure food, care for their children, and begin to rebuild their lives. These organizations provided an institutional blueprint for the election of female leaders at the local level; before long, many of these local associations became incorporated into larger, internationally-funded initiatives or NGOs. The women who rose to leadership levels in these associations soon became seen as viable candidates for political office. As I explain in-depth in my dissertation, the ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) regime was vocally supportive of women’s involvement in politics and leadership, and formal government initiatives were developed to incorporate grassroots leaders into the national government bureaucracy. As a result, the grassroots mobilization of women was eventually translated into formal political power.

THE ASSOCIATION AND DIVERSIFICATION OF TRAPEZIA CRABS WITH THEIR OBLIGATE POCILLOPORA CORAL HOSTS IN MO’OREA, FRENCH POLYNESIA
Natural and anthropogenic disturbances are changing coral reef systems at local and global scales. In Mo’orea, French Polynesia, it is unsure whether a Pocilloporid-and Poritid-dominant reef represents either a transitional, recovering community or a new, stable community (Pratchett 2010). Understanding the species-specific associations between coral-symbionts and their coral hosts will provide a more precise look at how symbionts contribute to their relationship. To better understand this mutualism, this study combined field surveys with phylogenetic analyses to examine the species-specific association between Trapezia crabs and their Pocillopora coral hosts and ask more broadly if there is an association between environmental variables and a morphological phylogeny of Trapezia. There was a significant association between certain species of Trapezia and Pocillopora (Likelihood ratio, x2=84.49, df=16, p=<0.0001*), whereT. rufopunctata was found most frequently withP. edyouxi (80.75%) andT. serenei onP. meandrina (63.4%) andP. verrucosa (37.50%). Discriminant analyses support that differences between crab communities are largely attributed to the morphological features (coral size and branching depth) of coral hosts. Field observations paired with a morphological phylogeny support a trend where similar sized corals were found to be associated with more closely related crab species. Understanding the degree of species-specific associations allows us to better grasp how coral communities and their symbionts will change with natural and anthropogenic episodic changes

Conditions of (Im)possibility : necropolitics, neoliberalism, and the cultural politics of death in contemporary Chicana/o film and literature
This dissertation argues that the selected literary and filmic texts examined in this study offer critical reconfigurations of the intersecting processes of neoliberal rationalities and the necropolitical order of power along the U.S.-Mexico border. Moreover, the texts examined in this dissertation refocus our attention on critical representations of social abandonment, denationalization, and the production of disposable life under contemporary neoliberal capitalism along the border region. Chapter 1, "The Maquila Complex : Necropolitical Landscapes and the Cartographies of Abandonment," examines the ways in which the film documentaries Maquilapolis : City of Factories (2006) and Señorita Extraviada : Missing Young Women (2001) and the novel Desert Blood : The Juárez Murders (2005) critically articulate and engage with cultural narratives and images of feminicide and anti- female terror. This chapter focuses on the ways in which these seemingly two different film documentaries (re)configure the "conditions of possibility" underwriting various forms of social and political abandonment, exceptionality, and denationalization. Chapter 2, "Reification, Disposability, and Resistance," continues looking at these three same texts in order to investigate the ways in which these distinct genres of Chicana/o cultural production articulate and reconfigure feminicide in relation to social reification, commodity fetishism, and cultural narratives of disposability. This chapter attempts to look at these two texts primarily through the Marxist concept of reification in order draw attention to the ways in which these texts imaginatively represent violence against women beyond immediate circumstances and towards a complex, contradictory narrative that captures the historicized gender, racial, and class dimensions of violence. Chapter 3, "What 'We' Do Abroad : Transnational Adoption and Liberal Internationalism under Contemporary Neoliberalism at the Borderlands," engages with the cultural representations of the neoliberal (b)order along the Mexico-U.S. borderlands. Linking Foucauldian analyses of neoliberal governmentality with critiques of liberal internationalism and transnational adoption, this chapter investigates the ways in which the novel Desert Blood : The Juárez Murders and the film Bordertown (2008) configure neoliberal rationalities embedded in the technologies of governing that produce discourses of blame, mismanaged life, and failed motherhood in relation to U.S. narratives of child rescue and humanitarian interventionism

Coping with the crisis : migration and settlement decisions of Yucateco migrants to the United States
This thesis explores the effect of the recent economic crisis on the migration and settlement decisions of the transnational community of Tunkás. News reports early into the crisis hypothesized that stripped of employment in the United States, unauthorized Mexican immigrants would return to their hometowns en masse. In fact, a mass return migration has failed to materialize. How and why are migrants deciding to stay in the United States? Also, how is the crisis affecting Tunkasen̋os decisions about new migration? By utilizing migrants' narratives, this paper aims to explain the complexities of migration and settlement decisions in the context of this current crisis. The author finds that despite job loss and reductions in wages, most migrants conclude that remaining in the U.S. is the best way to ensure the economic survival of their families. It is evident that these decisions are influenced by a myriad of economic, social, and personal factors that transcend the Tunkasen̋o community in the United States and Mexico. Throughout the paper, the author contextualizes migrants' narratives within various frameworks offered by migration theory. Rather than allowing these theories to guide an analysis of migrant narratives, the author uses these narratives to steer an interpretation of major theories of migration

The Opportunity Illusion: Subsidized Housing and Failing Schools in California
The nation’s largest low income housing production program, the awkwardly named Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), is providing billions of dollars for building homes across the country. It has been the only significant source of funds for building housing for poor families since the l980s. Yet few people know of its existence, fewer understand its complex mechanisms, and there has been virtually no information to answer critical questions about it. What we do know is that LIHTC is a costly program producing much needed affordable housing in one of the nation’s most expensive housing markets, where millions of people cannot afford to pay the cost of adequate housing. Who is it helping? Is it giving the children in these homes a better chance in life? Is it serving all groups in our society fairly? Is it opening up housing across the region’s color lines or is it investing in segregation? These are vital questions to ask, especially now with the collapse of the housing market and the financing freeze stalling new projects. Broadly speaking, is the public investment paying off for those it is supposed to help?

Engaging from Abroad: The Sociology of Emigrant Politics
This paper seeks to understand the politics of emigrants’ home country engagements, with a particular focus on experiences in the United States.  Long-distance emigrant politics, I argue, reflects the paradox of migration, which while inherently entailing mobility, is impelled by the unequal, territorial containment of resources, a feature of social life that both gives the migrants new found leverage over states and peoples left behindandconstrains their capacity to maintain cross-border connections. As I will show, the processes by which international migrations extend political ties across states collide with those that progressively bring migrants into the polities of the states on which they have converged; consequently, over the long term, the pursuit of emigrant politics turns into immigrant politics, embedding the former foreigners in the political life of the country where they actually reside.

Occupy Oakland Movement: A Logistic Modeling Approach To The Analysis of A Social Movement
In the summer of 2011, thousands of people unified and organized to create what is now known as the Occupy movement. To highlight the reckless financial practices that helped create a global economic crisis and a recession that has adversely affected the majority of Americans the movement's first protest took place on Wall Street in New York. Soon after, in cities across the country, people took to city halls and public spaces to join in the protest against economic and social inequalities. The social unrest displayed was an attempt by these protesters to influence government to the changing order of society. This study focuses on a smaller but vociferous and fervent branch of the Occupy movement, Occupy Oakland. The City of Oakland has drawn a substantial amount of attention because of the decisions of its Mayor on how to cope with the protesters and the strength used by law enforcement to clear the encampments. Data were collected using a survey instrument designed to capture people who identify with the Occupy Oakland movement. I aim to convey information about the people involved in the movement by analyzing descriptive statistics under the scope of social movement theories. Moreover, through logistic regression I explore whether ethnicity, employment, gender, education or party affiliation are key indicators for the alignment with the general ideology of this movement, which is to fight for greater social justice and economic equality.

A Policy of Stereotype Threat: The Intergroup Impact of Policing Stereotypes
Three studies demonstrate the manner in which a social policy, due to the stereotypes it communicates, can serve as a damaging psychological context that negatively biases attitudes and behaviors. In line with Richeson and Shelton's call for a more relational, interactive model of interracial interactions (2006), a dyadic view of stereotyping and bias is advanced. This dissertation highlights the negative intergroup interaction triggered by the policy of cross-deputization, which authorizes police officers to enforce immigration statutes, due to the stereotypes it communicates. Study 1 demonstrates that cross-deputization policy communicates two stereotypes: that police officers are racist and that Latinos are undocumented immigrants. Study 2 shows that those low-status (Latino) individuals who are vigilant for these stereotypes experience stereotype threat, intergroup anxiety, and expect more negative interactions with members of the high-status group (police). Study 3 shows that, again in response to cross-deputization policy, the aversion of high-status (police) individuals to these same stereotypes engenders stereotype threat and negative treatment of the low-status group (Latinos). Implications of cross-deputization policy for intergroup relations in the United States are discussed.

From Combat to College: Student Veterans in Academic 'Contact Zones'
In the current all-volunteer U.S. military, many low-income recruits enlist primarily for educational benefits. Yet many veterans encounter serious difficulties in transitions to civilian schools and do not graduate. While extensive research explores methods of military training and the effects of military service on socio-economic outcomes for veterans, little has been written about ways disjunctures between military and civilian pedagogies and culture shape veterans in civilian school settings. Using Lave’s analysis of situated learning and Pratt’s notion of ‘contact zones,’ this paper explores identities and practices of U.S. veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars as they re-enter community colleges and university classrooms.In-depth interviews, classroom observation and analysis of everyday discourse of veteran support organizations show disjunctures between soldiers’ lived reality and the discursive constructions of ‘warrior/hero’, ‘baby-killer’ and ‘student.’ As they re-enter the civilian world, soldiers not only contend with these shifting identities, they also encounter educational institutions that do not easily respond to them as students. This research finds that conflicting teaching, learning and cultural norms of military and civilian institutions, combined with enforced silences about the wars, exacerbate academic challenges.

[country, immigrant, change, technological, labor, fertility, chapter]

Essays in labor economics
This dissertation consists of three unrelated papers in labor economics. The first chapter documents the role of norms, both cultural and religious, in the fertility decisions of second-generation women in the US. Using two cohorts of immigrants (1970 and 2000s), I find that fertility declines among second-generation immigrants in the US are highly correlated with contemporaneous falls in total fertility rates (TFR) in Europe, implying that changes in the origin countries after parental emigration are still mirrored among current immigrants. This cross- country correlation is stronger for women from predominantly Catholic countries, which is consistent with immigrants from Catholic Europe sharing the Church's pro- natalist theology. The second chapter estimates the extent to which factor bias within manufacturing affects productivity growth across countries in the last two decades of the 20th Century. Skill-biased technological change (SBTC) implies that countries with more skilled labor and capital experience higher growth in total factor productivity (TFP), which is the case in both developed and developing countries in the 1980s. Labor-biased technological change is especially strong among the "newly industrializing countries" in the 1990s. These results are consistent with the empirical literature on skill-biased technological change, and may explain why "conditional convergence" of per capita income across countries is so slow. The final chapter examines the violence-reducing effect of development spending in Afghanistan. Using data from three distinct reconstruction programs and military records of insurgent-initiated events, the analysis finds that overall spending has no clear effects on the frequency of rebel attacks. Moreover, the types of development program most effective at reducing violence in Iraq -small CERP projects--does not appear to do so in Afghanistan

Strawsonian Libertarianism: A Theory of Free Will and Moral Responsibility
My dissertation develops a novel theory of free will and moral responsibility, Strawsonian libertarianism, which combines Strawsonianism about the concept of moral responsibility with event-causal libertarianism concerning its conditions of application.  I construct this theory in light of and response to the three main objections to libertarianism: the moral shallowness objection, the intelligibility objection, and the empirical plausibility objection.The moral shallowness objection contends that libertarianism seems plausible only in the absence of a robust understanding of the nature of moral responsibility.  P.F. Strawson's work is the fount of this objection.  In response I argue, surprisingly, that Strawson's account of the nature of responsibility, according to which the essence of responsibility is defined in terms of the reactive attitudes (such as gratitude and resentment), actually leads to libertarianism about its conditions of application.  In defense of this contention I offer a theory of the normative force of excuse which shows that moral responsibility requires that agents have free will.  I then construct the No Opportunity Argument which demonstrates that free will, and thus moral responsibility, is incompatible with determinism.In the remainder of the dissertation I develop and defend this account of moral responsibility against the intelligibility and empirical objections, both of which focus on my contention that indeterminism is necessary for freedom and responsibility.  The intelligibility objection contends that libertarians cannot provide an intelligible account of freedom and responsibility because indeterminism is either (at best) irrelevant or (at worst) inimical to control.  I respond to these objections by showing that if we locate indeterminism at the moment of free choice, libertarianism can explain both why indeterminism does not diminish control and also how it is relevant to enhancing it.Finally, I turn to the empirical plausibility objection which contends that libertarianism is scientifically implausible.  This objection centers on my contention that humans must be indeterministic systems in order to be free and responsible.  I argue that my commitment to neuronal indeterminism fares well in light of current physical and neurobiological findings and, therefore, that Strawsonian libertarianism is not as scientifically demanding as many have thought.

Gender Quotas and The Representation of Women: Empowerment, Decision-making, and Public Policy
Over the past two decades governments worldwide have begun to take action to correct gender disparity in representative bodies, resulting in drastic increases in women’s numeric representation. It is unclear, however, how these increases influence legislative behavior. This research contributes to our understanding of how increases in women’s numeric representation influences substantive representation of women. I collected an original dataset to examine this relationship across twenty-three subnational Argentine legislatures over eighteen years. This project represents one of the first empirical efforts to examine women’s substantive representation over a large number of legislatures over a long duration of time. 

A key piece of the puzzle is to understand if female exhibit distinct preferences from their male colleagues. The second chapter of the dissertation uses a new data set of ideal point estimates recovered from cosponsorship data to examine gender differences in legislative preferences. I find strong evidence to suggest women display different legislative preferences than their male colleagues. Chapter three investigates how increases in women’s numeric representation influence women’s legislative behavior. Previous research suggests that increasing women’s numeric representation should enhance the probability that women work together to pursue common legislative agendas. Yet, I demonstrate that as the percentage of women in the chamber increases, women are increasingly less likely to work together. I argue that this unexpected finding can be  
explained by considering how institutions shape women’s legislative incentives. In chapter four, I develop theoretical expectations about the conditions under which increases in the proportion of female legislators, in combination with institutional arrangements, will foster or stifle women’s opportunities and incentives to represent women’s interests. The chapter provides strong empirical support for the hypothesis that women behave differently conditional on institutional incentives. These findings imply that understanding institutions is key to understanding how and when female representatives will stand for women. Taken together, this dissertation makes an important contribution to our understanding of how changes in the proportion of female legislators and differences in institutional contexts shape women’s legislative behavior.

Subcenters in the Los Angeles Region
We investigate employment subcenters in the Los Angeles region using 1980 Census journey-to-work data. A simple subcenter definition is used, based solely on gross employment density and total employment. We find a surprising dominance of downtown Los Angeles and three large subcenters with which it forms a nearly contiguous corridor. Two-thirds of the region's employment, however, is outside any of the 32 centers we identify. Most centers have high population densities in and near them, and their workers' commutes are just 2.4 miles longer than other workers' commutes. A cluster analysis of employment by industry reveals several distinct types of centers, and a wide dispersion of sizes and locations within each type.

An army for the people : the self- defense forces and society in postwar Japan
This dissertation concerns the relations between the military and civil society in postwar Japan in the period between 1950 and the late 1980s. I examine the processes by which the military, namely the Self-Defense Forces (SDF), established close ideological and socio-economic ties with civil society and normalized itself in a constitutional order that renounced war and banned the possession of war potential. I first focus on how the US occupation forces and Japanese government leaders presented the event of rearmament at the discursive level, and then shift my attention to how the SDF and other state institutions interacted with civilians at the local and material level. My main argument is that not only the state but also civil society itself contributed to consolidating civil-military interdependency. The significance of this study is that it concerns the militarization of society as a structural problem immanent to the capitalist economy that operates with the nation- state as its basic unit. The military takes advantage of such problems as class difference and uneven development between the city and the countryside, and appeals to those who do not benefit from this economic system. By investigating this process, I demonstrate that the governance of civil society in the modern liberal state works not necessarily through suppression or prohibition but by encouraging the active participation and engagement of those governed

Intimate Partner Violence and Social Pressure among Gay Men in Six Countries
Introduction: Recent research suggests that men who have sex with men (MSM) experience intimate partner violence (IPV) at significantly higher rates than heterosexual men. Few studies, however, have investigated implications of heterosexist social pressures – namely, homophobic discrimination, internalized homophobia, and heterosexism– on risk for IPV among MSM, and no previous studies have examined cross-national variations in the relationship between IPV and social pressure. This paperexamines reporting of IPV and associations with social pressure among a sample of internet-recruited MSM in the United States (U.S.), Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Brazil.
      Methods: We recruited internet-using MSM from 6 countries through selective banner advertisements placed on Facebook. Eligibility criteria were men age over 18 reporting sex with a man in the past year. Of the 2,771 eligible respondents, 2,368 had complete data and were included in the analysis. Threeoutcomes were examined: reporting recent experience of physical violence, sexual violence, and recent perpetration of physical violence. The analysis focused on associations between reporting of IPV and experiences of homophobic discrimination, internalized homophobia, and heteronormativity.
      Results: Reporting of experiencing physical IPV ranged from 5.75% in the U.S. to 11.75% in South Africa, while experiencing sexual violence was less commonly reported and ranged from 2.54% in Australia to 4.52% in the U.S. Perpetration of physical violence ranged from 2.47% in the U.S. to 5.76% in South Africa. Experiences of homophobic discrimination, internalized homophobia, and heteronormativity were found to increase odds of reporting IPV in all countries.
      Conclusion: There has been little data on IPV among MSM, particularly MSM living in low- and middleincome countries. Despite the lack of consensus in demographic correlates of violence reporting, heterosexist social pressures were found to significantly increase odds of reporting IPV in all countries.These findings show the universality of violence reporting amongMSMacross countries, and highlight the unique role of heteronormativity asa risk factor for violence reporting among MSM. The results demonstrate that using internet-based surveys to reachMSMis feasible for certain areas, although modified effortsmay be required to reach diverse samples of MSM.

Medical students' attitudes toward gay men
AbstractBackgroundHealthcare providers&#8217; attitudes toward sexual minorities influence patient comfort and outcomes. This study characterized medical student attitudes toward gay men, focusing on behavior, personhood, gay civil rights, and male toughness.MethodsA cross-sectional web-based anonymous survey was sent to medical students enrolled at the University of California, Davis (N&#8201;=&#8201;371) with a response rate of 68%.ResultsFew respondents expressed negative attitudes toward gay men or would deny them civil rights. More negative responses were seen with respect to aspects of intimate behavior and homosexuality as a natural form of sexual expression. Men and students younger than 25&#8201;years old were more likely to endorse negative attitudes toward behavior as well as more traditional views on male toughness.ConclusionsWe show that an important minority of students express discomfort with the behavior of gay men and hold to a narrow construction of male identity. These findings suggest that competency training must move beyond conceptual discussions and address attitudes toward behaviors through new pedagogical approaches.

Market Profiles of Rail-Based Housing Projects in California
Proponents of rail-based housing contend that besides the obvious transportation benefits of having more people residing near transit stops, a number of other second-level benefits would accrue as well: increases in affordable housing, more choices on where to live and how to travel, increased mobility for transportation-disadvantaged groups, and the creation of a village environment where people from all walks of life come into daily contact with each other, similar to America's streetcar cities at the turn of the century. For the most part, these second-level benefits could be expected to accrue to specific subpopulations: young families in search of affordable housing; people who are tired of traffic snarls and want to live near transit to ease their commute; the elderly and the poor who have limited access to autos; and perhaps even recent immigrants anxious to assimilate into American culture and looking for a multicultural neighborhood near transit in which to do so.

Security and Elections
Elections are common to almost all societies. Periodically, groups of people determine their representatives, leaders, neighborhood spokespersons, corporate executives, or union representatives by casting ballots and counting votes using a variety of schemes. Those who don’t participate see others around them doing so. And stories abound about rigged elections or results considered compromised by accident or poor communication.
      US-based elections follow a general pattern of voter registration, determining items to vote on, generating ballots, distributing election materials to the polling places, voting, counting the votes, declaring winners, and auditing the results. The details differ among jurisdictions, but each step requires considerable care to ensure the election’s integrity. So, elections are an ideal mechanism for teaching about security.
      At the University of California, Davis, we teach numerous computer security classes for undergraduate majors and nonmajors and for graduate students. This column presents some of our experiences using elections and e-voting systems as lecture material and as a class project done with the Yolo County Elections Office.

Outlook of the Officers: Military Thought in Chile, 1960-1990
This dissertation examines the ideas, values, and intellectual formation of officers in the Chilean armed forces during the second half of the twentieth century, charting change and continuity in the outlook of men who played a central role in their nation's history.  It seeks to characterize the full complexity of military thought in the postwar era, identifying the lens through which officers saw the world, their role in society, and relationship to and place in Chilean history.The first half of the dissertation examines the nature of US military influence in Chile, military attitudes towards civilian society, and changes in military discourse after the Cuban Revolution.  During the sixties officers reached a number of important conclusions about modern warfare and the world system by studying conflicts in the Third World.  With respect to the Popular Unity coalition (1970-1973) the armed forces' professionalism and apolitical tendencies proved a substantial barrier to political involvement although circumstances eventually led to a consensus that Salvador Allende's government was an existential threat to the nation and the armed forces had a patriotic duty to overthrow it.The second half of the dissertation examines the incipient ideology of Chile's military government, its internal policy disputes, and the perspective of soldiers who, after 1974, faced military threats from Peru and Argentina and deep international isolation as a result of human rights violations.  This situation fostered a siege mentality and had multiple unintended consequences.  For one, the US arms embargo (1975) spurred the development of Chile's domestic arms industry and reduced Washington's political leverage in Chile. In 1983, nationwide protests seemed to augur a quick transition to civilian rule.  However, the armed forces agreed that any exit from power had to be `honorable' and consistent with their distinction as an undefeated military.  Officers also drew from Chile's conservative tradition and their own intellectual culture to argue that they had a historical mandate to reorganize society after 1973 and to exercise a formal, tutelary role in the polity after 1990.

Reinventing The Body Politic: Women, Consumer Culture, and Civic Identity from Suffrage to the New Deal
"Reinventing the Body Politic: Women, Consumer Culture, and Civic Identity from Suffrage to the New Deal" argues that social feminists of the 1920s found in consumer culture a means through which to create a model of female political participation that was consistent both with their own ideals and pervasive images of modern womanhood accepted by most Americans.  By adopting the images, and methods of consumer culture in their rhetoric, women's political organizations attempted to wrap a new political identity for women in the familiar trappings of consumer culture.  In so doing, they solidified the transformation of twentieth-century political culture from its roots in local political party machines to a modern form in which national public relations professionals and issue-based lobbies dominated.  My dissertation unites social feminism and consumer culture through the notion of the consumerist compromise.  Striking an intermediate path using the tenets of consumer culture, social feminists argued that modern consumer conveniences granted women the free time to pursue interests outside the home, that women's status as consumers made them vital to the national economy, and that the complexities of modern industrial life blurred the lines between domestic and public spheres making politics increasingly significant to the quality of women's lives.  Social feminist organizations accepted this image of modern American womanhood as a public relations strategy designed to increase female voter participation and, in turn, their leverage as lobbyists.  The consumerist compromise helped social feminists' usher in a modern American liberalism consistent with their progressive social reform agenda and in which they served as experts in labor relations, industrial health and safety, and child welfare.  Their success during the New Deal was the culmination of these efforts and reflected both their lasting impact on American politics and the limits of their political power.

Essays on Well-Being in Japan
This dissertation is comprised of four papers on well-being in Japan and aims to examine three important measures of well-being: perceptions of job insecurity, self-reported happiness, and suicide. The first chapter is titled "The Deregulation of Temporary Agency Staffing Services and Worker Perceptions of Job Insecurity in Japan" and examines whether the expansion of temporary agencies contributes to a rise in perceptions of job insecurity among workers in Japan, where non-regular employment has increased in recent years. I exploit the temporary staffing deregulation of 2004 and identify the impact of the law change as the difference between the change in the perceptions of job insecurity of low-skill manufacturing workers (treatment group) and the change in the perceptions of job insecurity of other non-manufacturing low-skill workers (control group). I find that the temporary agency staffing deregulation significantly contributed to the rise in job insecurity among low-skill manufacturing workers. The second chapter is titled "Does Social Trust Increase Individual Happiness in Japan?" This paper tests the hypothesis that social trust is valuable intrinsically by using individual happiness data from Japan and finds that social trust has positive and significant effects on individual happiness. Furthermore, additional tests suggest heterogeneous effects of social trust. The third chapter is titled "Suicide and Local Unemployment in Japan: Evidence from Municipal Level Suicide Rates and Age-Specific Suicide Rates" and investigates the link between suicide and unemployment in Japan, where suicide has drawn much attention from researchers, policymakers, and the general public. The results from fixed-effects models show that an increase in the unemployment rate significantly contributed to the male suicide rate during the period 1985-2007, and prime age working men aged 35-64 are the most vulnerable group. The fourth chapter is titled "The Effect of Local Labor Market Conditions at Entry on Male Suicides in Japan," which tests if entering the labor market during a recession increases the male suicide rate in Japan and finds that the effect of a recession at labor market entry has persistent adverse effects on the subsequent suicide risk.

Savings Constraints and Microenterprise Development: Evidence from a Field Experiment in Kenya
To what extent does the lack of access to formal financial services impede business growth in low-income countries? While most research on this issue has so far focused on credit market failures, this paper focuses on the role of access to formalsavingservices. We conducted a field experiment in which a randomly selected sample of self-employed individuals in rural Kenya got access to an interest-free bank account. As the bank charged substantial withdrawal fees, the de facto interest rate on the account was negative. Despite this, take-up and usage of the account was high among our sample of market vendors, primarily composed of women. Access to an account had a substantial, positive impact on levels of productive investments among market women, and, within 6 months, led to higher income levels, as proxied by expenditures. These results imply that a substantial fraction of women entrepreneurs have difficulty saving and investing as much as they would like, and have a demand for formal saving devices - even those that offer negative interest rates. Our results also imply a relatively high upper bound on the rate of return to capital for the women in our sample, estimated at 5.5% per month at the median. Note that these results do not necessarily imply gender differences: our sample of male entrepreneurs is too small to generate results for that group.

Novel mixed organoboranes for the reductive alkylation of p-benzoquinone
In the early 1960's, Hawthorne discovered the quantitative synthesis of alkylhydroquinones by reacting 1,4- benzoquinone with trialkylboranes formed from hydroboration. Later work revealed limitations to the reductive alkylation of benzoquinones due to the poor regioselectivity of the hydroboration and the migratory aptitudes of the alkyl groups, namely transferring the more substituted group impacting product purity. During this process, only one alkyl substituent transfers while the others are lost, thus resulting in formation of a borinic ester that is difficult to remove, air-sensitive, radical generating, and ultimately degrades product purity. Mixed organoboranes can overcome these difficulties using auxiliary groups with relatively low migratory aptitudes, such as phenyl groups or methyl groups. Our group has developed the first general preparation of alkyldiphenylboranes. They readily react with p-benzoquinone successfully demonstrating the applicability of using mixed organoboranes. In this study, we are investigating using methyl groups as our auxiliary. Our initial studies used Matteson's hydroboration procedure using triethylsilane and trichloroborane to form the unsolvated dichloroborane, HBCl₂, a highly regioselective reagent for a variety of olefins and avoids limitations of ligand complexed boranes. Once the alkyldichloroboranes were synthesized, they were methylated using the Grignard reagent or dimethylzirconocene. The reaction conditions were somewhat dependant on the alkyl group. The purity of the alkyldimethylborane was analyzed by boron NMR after complexation to a ligand. Addition of the alkyldimethylboranes to p-benzoquinone quickly resulted in ca. 90% isolated yields of the alkylhydroquinone. The resulting dimethylborinic acid is easily removed preventing any radical side reactions. Overall, we have developed a general route for the reductive alkylation of quinones, with good selectivity and in high yields, demonstrating the applicability of methyl auxiliary groups. As such, attempts were made to synthesize vinyldimethylboranes using the developed synthetic routes

Cultural Tourism for Salvador, Brazil:  A Viable Means of Community Economic Development
In Brazil, slavery's despotic legacy of racial marginality presently continues in the form of racial economic inequality.  The outcome of which has resulted in the existence of two very different Brazil's, bifurcated based on racial income differentiation.  One Brazil is "black", while the other is "white".  In black Brazil, blacks generally earn 28 times less than their white counterparts.  To decrease the racial income gap, the success of cultural tourism as a viable means of community economic development in Salvador, Brazil has been examined.  Salvador is known as the Black Rome and thus provides the most African cultural experience to tourists outside of Africa.  Although the cultural tourism industry in Salvador yields significant profits from Afro-Brazilian culture, black cultural producers may be victims of exploitation, of which one outcome is not receiving congruent benefit from their contributions to the industry.  This may signal that in order to decrease racial economic inequality, solutions tied solely to financial increase may be insufficient.

Understanding the role of outsourced labor in web service abuse
Modern Web services are typically free and open access, often supported by advertising revenue. These attributes, however, leave services vulnerable to many forms of abuse, including sending spam via Web-based email accounts, inflating page rank scores by spamming backlinks on blogs, etc. However, many of these schemes are nontrivial to execute, requiring technical expertise and access to ancillary resources (e.g. IP diversity, telephone numbers, etc.). Thus, many scammers prefer to offload the execution of their abuse schemes onto hired labor. This desire to minimize effort has created a demand for workers to carry out malicious tasks. Meanwhile, various online labor marketplaces have emerged that connect employers with cheap, human workers. Abusers have turned to online freelancing sites to find workers willing to carry out numerous schemes. Outsourcing is an attractive option for entrepreneurial scammers, as the workers are typically cheap, technically adept, and exist in vast numbers. In this dissertation, we investigate how outsourcing impacts the security of Web services; no longer must service providers be wary of automated tools, they must now contend with inexpensive human labor willing to do any menial task. In the first part of the dissertation, we characterize the role of freelance labor in Web service abuse, analyzing over seven years of data from the popular crowdsourcing site Freelancer.com, as well data from our own active job solicitations. We identify the largest classes of abuse work, including account creation, social networking link generation and search engine optimization support, and characterize how pricing and demand have evolved in supporting this activity. We show that scammers heavily employ outsourced labor, with abuse jobs constituting approximately 30% of the job solicitations on the site. Further, we demonstrate that workers quickly adapt their skill sets in responses to changes in demand for various abuse tasks. Lastly, the engagement portion of our study shows that workers actually deliver the promised goods, though the quality of the items is often variable. The second part of the dissertation focuses exclusively on the role of humans in circumventing CAPTCHAs. Human CAPTCHA solving services represent a heavily commercialized, outsourced abuse task, and we perform an in-depth analysis of this industry. CAPTCHAs are an ubiquitous defense used to protect open Web resources from being exploited at scale. In response to the widespread deployment of CAPTCHAs, a robust solving ecosystem has emerged, selling real-time human labor to bypass these protections. We analyze the behavior and dynamics of CAPTCHA-solving service providers, their price performance, and the underlying labor markets driving this economy. Ultimately, our work shows that CAPTCHAs are effective at differentiating between humans and computers. However, due to the vast number of human workers willing to solve CAPTCHAs for low wages, CAPTCHAs cannot necessarily prevent widespread abuse; instead, they serve as a low- cost economic impediment to abusers The results from these two studies demonstrate the increasing role that outsourcing plays in abusing Web services at scale. Furthermore, they suggest that Web services not only need to consider automated threats, but also must contend with an agile human labor pool. Lastly, they suggest one way to evaluate deployed security mechanisms, by monitoring the price and demand fluctuations for various abusively obtained products

North African Immigration in Contemporary Spain: Representations of the Struggle for Integration and Power
During the last three decades, Spain has witnessed numerous changes in its political, economical, and social system.   Among those changes, the integration of Spain into the European Union and the economic and political reforms implemented by the government were fundamental factors in the transformation of the country into a popular destination for immigrants.  This dissertation examines contemporary North African immigration to Spain and its representation in late twentieth and early twenty-first century Spanish narrative and cinema.  From a historical point of view, there exists a strong parallelism between North African immigration in the recent past and the Arab invasion of Spain during the Middle Ages, as numerous studies have pointed out. With that in mind, I explore the construction of literary and cinematographic discourses that expose the revival of an immigrant "Other" as a result of the social and economic interaction between contemporary Spaniards and North African immigrants.  At the same time, I explore the way this interaction is determined by the impossibility within Spain of establishing a precise definition of Spanish identity, causing immigrants to be cast aside from the host community both socially and economically.  The interaction between Spaniards and North Africans is also significantly influenced by historical relationships and the Spanish desire for individuality and power.  I argue that the power exerted on immigrants is presented in the texts that I study in three principal ways:   (1) imposed silence, (2) physical manipulation, and (3) labor exploitation.  These in turn are linked by the economical and social failure of the immigrants' integration process and the Spaniards' blurred definition of their national and cultural identity.  I analyze the construction of this relationship of power based on the codependence created by both groups: the North Africans as the dominated objects that depend on the Spaniards to survive and the Spaniards as the dominant subject whose position is divided between the power they exert on the immigrants and the dependency on the North Africans' submission in order to prevail.

The Postdomestic Woman: Divorce and the Ex-Wife in American Literature, Film, and Culture
This project establishes and analyzes a new character type, which I have termed the "postdomestic woman."  The postdomestic woman is a female character who has been divorced or alienated from a marriage.  Frequently this character has purposefully severed her marital relationship and thus deliberately operates as an independent agent based on her own desire to do so.  Regardless of intention, the postdomestic woman must renegotiate her identity within society.  Issues of freedom, femininity, family, and love are central to the postdomestic woman, as she must re-signify these once (seemingly) stable concepts according to her new postdomestic identity.I begin my research in chapter one by investigating the history of divorce in the Unites States and examining the factors that have shaped the cultural life of this phenomenon.  Chapter two is concerned with the politics of representation and the ways in which women and divorce are depicted in film.  This chapter explains the relationship between custody law reform, feminism, and antifeminism in Hollywood film over the last fifty years.  In chapter three I shift to literary analysis and examine the postdomestic women characters in twentieth century novels featuring African American families.  Chapter three centers on black literary matriarchs and interprets Toni Morrison's <italic>Beloved</italic>, Percival Everett's <italic>Erasure</italic>, and Andrew Winer's <italic>The Color Midnight Made</italic> through the lens of contemporary rhetoric regarding single black motherhood, such as the Moynihan Report's argument regarding "pathological" family structures and Reaganite claims about black "welfare queens."  In chapter four I demonstrate that the postdomestic woman is vital to the postmodern literary project of de-centering master narratives by performing close textual readings of Thomas Pynchon's <italic>The Crying of Lot 49</italic>, Joan Didion's <italic>Play it as it Lays</italic>, John Hawkes' <italic>Death, Sleep, and the Traveler</italic> and Don Delillo's <italic>Mao II</italic>.   Throughout this project I specifically focus on the representation of divorced female characters and, through an examination of such characters in film and literature, I establish a theoretical framework for defining and understanding the postdomestic woman within American culture.

Jobs-Housing Balancing and Regional Mobility
Despite the steady migration of jobs to the suburbs over the past decade, many suburban residents commute farther than ever. In this article I attribute the widening separation of suburban workplaces and the residences of suburban workers to several factors: fiscal and exclusionary zoning that results in an undersupply of housing; rents and housing costs that price many service workers out of the local residential market; and several demographic trends, including the growth in dual wage-earner households and career shifts. Case studies of metropolitan Chicago and San Francisco confirm the displacing effects of high housing costs and housing shortages. In addition, data from over 40 major suburban employment centers in the United States show that suburban workplaces with severe jobs-housing imbalances tend to have low shares of workers making walking and cycling trips and high levels of congestion on connecting freeways. I argue that inclusionary zoning, tax-base sharing, fair-sharing housing programs, and a number of incentive-base programs could reduce hobs-housing mismatches and go a long way toward safeguarding regional mobility for years to come.

Arthropod communities on decomposing fruit in agricultural and forested areas on Moorea, French Polynesia
A controlled observation study was used to determine differences in athropod communities on fruits introduced to the island of Mo’orea, French Polynesia, approximately 300 and 1000 years ago respectively: papaya (Carica papaya) and Tahitian chestnut (Inocarpus fagifer), in two regions: an agricultural school and a tropical moist broadleaf forest. Distinct differences in communities existed by fruit and region, and there was interaction between the influence of region and fruit type. Papaya communities showed the most differences by region. Papaya communities had a greater mean number of individuals and taxa than Tahitian chestnut communities. Region did not have a significant effect on the mean number of individuals and taxa, but for both individuals and taxa the forested region showed more variation in the communities found on each fruit than in the agricultural region, perhaps due to greater niche differentiation (competition among species), on the less frequently disturbed site. The most abundant taxa were flies (Diptera) and ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Community differentiation by region appeared to be influenced most strongly by less abundant species, rather than by the most abundant taxa. This study provides groundwork for future studies of tropical relationships between arthropods, land use changes, and fruit, and provides evidence of agricultural impacts on arthropod communities.

The Architecture of Homelessness: Space, Marginality, and Exile in Modern French and Japanese Literature and Film
My dissertation, &ldquo;The Architecture of Homelessness: Space, Marginality, and Exile in Modern French and Japanese Literature and Film,&rdquo; explores the literature of marginality in the age of rampant urban growth and development, initially during the Haussmannization of Paris and during Meiji Japan. Both cross-cultural and interdisciplinary, my project compares the liminal aspects of the architecture of two vastly different metropolises, Paris and Tokyo, through representations in literature and film. In addition, it reaches back in time to mid-nineteenth century and stretches forward to modern day. The opening chapters analyze works by writers Emile Zola, Higuchi Ichiy&#333;, and Shimazaki T&#333;son, who captured their respective countries' urban transformation as it was occurring and simultaneously represented the lives of people, especially the lower classes, marginalized by this exponential growth. In these chapters I argue that the liminal space left over from newly built architecture and the space on the edge of mainstream society becomes &ldquo;home&rdquo; to those displaced persons. This process of urbanization and the subsequent marginalization of its minorities irrevocably bind these two nations together.While my first three chapters concentrate on the rapid urbanization of Paris and Tokyo as represented in literature, in the final chapter, I articulate the way in which homelessness is depicted on film in France and Japan through cinematic analysis of five films: Akira Kurosawa's <italic>Rash&#333;mon</italic> and <italic>Dodesukaden</italic>, Eric Rohmer's <italic>Le Signe du Lion</italic>, Mathieu Kassovitz's <italic>La Haine</italic>, and Abdellatif Kechiche's <italic>L'Esquive</italic>. I argue that these four filmmakers, in the style of Naficy's &ldquo;exile cinema,&rdquo; confront this taboo topic in their texts by bringing the problem of urban failure to the public's consciousness. Rather than mental illness, addiction, poverty, or ill-fated fortunes, I propose that the central problem of homelessness rests with an individual's alienation from his or her community or in-group. Homelessness, urban living, and marginal spaces are not particular to any one city. My project moves away from East-West dualism and area studies to explore global concepts of space, the effects of rapid urbanization at its onset and today, and the problem of homelessness, which has no boundaries.

Identity & Relocation Policy: Using Oral History to Affectively Map the Experience of Relocated American Indians in Los Angeles.
The relocation policy began in the early 1950's and ended in the 1970's. The policy was created to move reservation Indians into cities by providing relocation assistance in the form of housing, job placement, training, etc. This policy, and Federal Indian policies like it, present logics of assimilation. Existing scholarship has shared these views and has discussed the response to Urban Indian Identity in a variety of ways.  In this thesis I will use the oral history accounts of eight relocated Indians in Los Angeles in conjunction with previous scholarship to discuss the experience of relocation. This thesis will pose the narratives of the eight interviewees within the context of settler colonial structures and will explore how these eight relocatees re-envisioned Indian identity.

Individual, social and environmental correlates of physical activity among Latinos in San Diego County
Physical inactivity is a behavioral risk factor for obesity and chronic disease. While some studies have reported low levels of leisure time physical activity (PA) among Latinos, other studies support that some Latinos engage in other active behaviors such as walking for transportation. This study used the Social Ecological Model to provide a broader perspective of the multiple influences on PA patterns among Latinos adults. Structural equation modeling was used to explain how individual, social and environmental level factors influenced leisure and nonleisure time PA in a Latino border population of San Diego County. In the fall of 2006, the San Diego Prevention Research Center conducted a telephone- administered survey assessing demographics, social- ecological factors, and PA. The survey was completed by 672 Latino adults randomly sampled from a community in San Diego County. The mean age of respondents was 39±13 years with the majority being female (71%). Over half of respondents were unemployed (53%), Spanish-speakers (57%) and classified as less acculturated. Less than one third of respondents met PA guidelines in their leisure (32%) and nonleisure (29%) time. Men were more likely to meet LTPA recommendations, whereas women were more likely to engage in nonleisure walking at recommended levels. Latino respondents living in the U.S. for less than 12 years were more likely to meet PA guidelines in their leisure and nonleisure time. In an individual-level model, social support and self-efficacy for PA and acculturation were not related to meeting LTPA guidelines, where as there was a direct relationship with consuming more fruits and vegetables. While increasing level of education and being single were also positively related to meeting LTPA guidelines, there was negative association with living in the U.S. for 12/more years and being female. After controlling for these relationships in a social ecological model, results showed that neighborhood cohesion was significantly associated with safety from crime, which was marginally associated with meeting LTPA guidelines. Structural/pedestrian safety was marginally associated meeting LTPA guidelines, but in the negative direction. Meeting LTPA guidelines was positively related to community resource use and being single, but was negatively associated with living in the U.S. for 12/more years and being female. A social ecological model was examined for nonleisure walking at recommended levels. Findings showed that being female was positively related to PA adherence in nonleisure time. Factors negatively related to nonleisure walking at recommended levels were increasing income and acculturation, living in the U.S. for 12/more years, and being Mexican-born. The key findings highlight 1) gender and acculturation differences in leisure and nonleisure time PA, and 2) correlates of leisure and nonleisure time PA among Latino adults. This study provides a better understanding of PA, and can be used to inform future research targeting multi-level factors to promote active living in Latino communities

Social boundaries and state formation in ancient Edom : a comparative ceramic approach
In recent years, the area referred to as "Edom" in ancient Egyptian and Biblical texts, dating to the 2nd and 1st millennium BCE, has sparked much scholarly debate over chronology, the nature of its social organization and the relationship of the archaeology of Edom to ancient Near Eastern textual sources. Located in southern Jordan, relatively little Iron Age (ca. 1200 - 500 BCE) archaeological work has been carried out here resulting in a failure to develop an objective chronology for measuring and understanding social evolution in one of the southern Levant's key geographic regions. This has resulted in many gaps concerning the nature of the social complexity of Edom. This dissertation examines the emergence of complex societies and social boundaries in Iron Age Edom through the lens of ceramic analysis. Consequently, the thesis will illuminate some of the mechanisms underlying social change and social boundary formation in this region. The study tests a range of models using new archaeological and ceramic data from Iron Age Edom in the following manner: 1) by relying on theory from cognitive anthropology, a series of testable methods are employed for determining ancient social boundaries based on examining how technological styles are learned by a culture; 2) using recent UCSD archaeological excavations from seven previously untested sites in Edom that provide new data for testing these social models concerning social complexity in Biblical Edom; 3) employing ceramic ethnoarchaeology to help analyze the ancient ceramic assemblages from these sites to clarify their role in social boundary formation; 4) using petrographic analysis that gives a more detailed look into the ceramic assemblages, thereby increasing an understanding of where pottery originated and what materials were used - factors that ultimately reflect distinctions between different ancient pottery producing communities; and 5) developing the first comprehensive ceramic typology for the entire Iron Age II (ca. 1000 - 500 BCE) sequence of Edom that encompasses both the lowlands and highlands. Thus, this study contributes new data, methods and testable theoretical models for studying the archaeological record of the Iron Age Southern Levant when the first historical state level societies emerged in this part of the ancient Near East

Essays on Civil War and Welfare: Child Mortality, Learning Attainment, and Access to Water and Sanitation Services
This dissertation deals with the effects of civil war on child and infant mortality, learning attainment and access to water and sanitation services. Household and individual level data (such as theDemographic and Health Surveys and the Colombian Standardized Saber test) are extensively used along with data on conflict intensity (such as Prio-Uppsala Battle Deaths and the Colombian PoliceCrime statistics). The first chapter explores how different intensity levels of civil war lead to changes in child and infant mortality in Latin American countries that have experienced lengthy civil wars (Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Peru).  Econometric procedures indicate that civil war increases the risk of mortality during the first year of life. Using individual level test scoresfrom Colombia, as the measure of learning attainment, the second chapter studies how exposure to civil war at birth and at the year of the test impacts math and language learning. Exposure to conflictat birth reduces the learning attainment of 5th grade students. Results seem to be not conclusive for 9th and 11 grade students due to sample attrition. The third chapter estimates how civil warmodifies households' access to water and sanitation services and, in turn, the health of children in Colombia. Employing different methods to control for the civil war intensity, regressions found thatcivil war leads to contradictory effects on access to water and sanitation services. Overall, estimations throughout the three chapters provide strong evidence supporting the existence of negative effects of civil war on child and infant mortality, learning attainment and access to water and sanitation services. The techniques and the theoretical model used in the third chapter also open up the way for the existence of households' adaptive behavior while the conflict goes on. Results also suggest a role for government interventions in helping households cope with these negative effects.

[justice, environmental, community, harm, injustice, conception]

Modeling Environmental Justice: A Normative Conception for Healthier Communities
The term environmental justice (EJ) is broadly used to frame discussions regarding unjust or unequal distributions of environmental harms between different communities. Typically, we see examples where air, water, and soil quality are significantly worse in poorer communities, especially poorer communities of color, than in wealthier, white communities. While poor environmental quality is not desirable, severely environmentally impacted communities, and the individuals who inhabit them, often face much worse consequences, in the form of health effects that can often have long-term implications for opportunities and achievements.	The project of my dissertation is the creation of a flexible and empirically-informed model for both diagnosing the injustices and guiding policy decisions that will result in a more just distribution of risks, and prevent some of the grossest injustices. John Rawls and Amartya Sen provide the philosophical basis for the claims of injustice, and help to guide the normative conception I develop the latter parts of the work. Ultimately, I argue that we need a conception of environmental justice that will lead both to just institutional and background conditions to prevent harms, as well as providing mechanisms of restorative justice for those who have already faced harms. The Rawlsian project of "Justice as Fairness" will provide guidance for the institutional framework whose goal is the creation of more perfect justice, while Sen's work will aid in making comparative judgments of the well-being of particular individuals.

Making Legal: The Dream Act, Birthright Citizenship, and Broad-Scale Legalization
Some of the most controversial topics in immigration and citizenship law involve granting lawful immigration status—or citizenship itself—to persons who might otherwise be in the United States unlawfully. In this Article, I examine arguments for and against three ways to confer lawful status: (1) the DREAM Act, which would grant status to many unauthorized migrants who were brought to the United States as children; (2) the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, under which almost all children born on U.S. soil are U.S. citizens; and (3) broad-scale proposals to grant lawful immigration status to a substantial percentage of the current unauthorized population. I first explain how arguments both for and against the DREAM Act reflect some mix of fairness and pragmatism. Though birthright citizenship seems different from the DREAM Act, the arguments are similar. I next show that although children figure much more prominently in the DREAM Act and birthright citizenship, similar patterns of argument apply to broadscale legalization, and the arguments in favor are just as strong. Finally, I explain that the “rule of law” is a highly malleable concept that provides no persuasive case against any of these ways to confer

Is There a Quiet Revolution in Women's Travel? Revisiting the Gender Gap in Commuting
Gender is both an archetypal and adaptive dimension of the urban condition and thus remains a key moving target for planning practitioners and scholars alike. This is especially true of women’s growing, if not revolutionary, involvement in the economy. A familiar exception is the trip linking work and home – the commute – which has been consistently and persistently shorter for women than men. That said, new reports suggest that the gender gap in commuting time and distance may have quietly vanished in some areas. To explore this possibility, I use panel data from the American Housing Survey to better measure and explain commute trends for the entire U.S. from 1985 through 2005. They overwhelmingly indicate that differences stubbornly endure, with men’s and women’s commuting distances converging only slowly and commuting times diverging. My results also show that commuting times are converging for all races, especially for women; women’s job access remains poorer than men’s, and women’s trips to work by transit are dwindling rapidly. Thus sex continues to play an important role explaining travel, housing, and labor market dynamics, with major implications for planning practice.

Welcome to Black Rock City: Ephemeral Homes, Built Environments, and Participatory Negotiations
By applying Bourdieu’s ideas of habitus and doxa, this paper explores how Burning Man participants negotiate ideological and pragmatic limitations in transforming a vast desert landscape into an urban physical and social space. The ephemeral city serves as a model for radical self-expression with an internal society that creates an engaging participatory experience among differing and sometimes conflicting social institutions. Black Rock City LLC, committed to democratically and collaboratively engaging with festival participants in the production of space, demonstrates a realistic possibility for successful negotiation of pragmatics and ideologies while still allowing ample room to foster freedom and community. In examining these dynamic negotiations and their resultant influences on the physical landscape through varied lenses, this article suggests how Black Rock City might be a portable adaptation for other spaces of insurgency.

Gender, Bilingualism, and the Early Occupational Careers of Second-Generation Mexicans in the South
Following two decades of Mexican migration to the southern United States, the second generation is entering the labor market.  We analyze the early occupational careers of fifty-eight second-generation young adults in Dalton, Georgia, a global carpet manufacturing center.  We find intergenerational occupational mobility, with children of Mexican immigrants deploying human capital skills to access better jobs than their parents.  However, the Mexican second generation faces opportunity ladders structured along gender lines, with women working in services and men laboring as bilingual supervisors and crew leaders in the carpet industry.  While bilingual skills play a critical role in the employment paths members of the second generation have started to chart, their use of bilingualism is also shaped by gender dynamics in the workplace.

What Does Labour Law Have To Say About Especially Vulnerable Women Victims?
There is a pronounced breach of gender in this field that leads vulnerable women, at times, to greater exclusion from the labour market, and at other times, to the submerged economy, to labour segregation, and also to poverty. As a result, working relations reveal their weaknesses. The especially vulnerable victim is a concept that has arisenwithin the United Nations in 1985. The first thing that we should identify are thewomen that suffer this situation, as it is there where the Law is called on to introduce legislative measures that combat these circumstances. Consequently, vulnerable women are turned into a group object treated in the singular to achieve their social and labour integration, an end that will principally be achieved, thanks to labour integration and the protection of the Social Security Regime (shifting this study to the social branch of Law).

"Who's Better than God to Rule?" - An Inquiry into the Formation of the First Islamic State (622-32 CE)
ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION"Who's Better than God to Rule?" - An Inquiry into the Formation of the First Islamic State (622-32 CE)ByFiazuddin ShuaybDoctor of Philosophy in Islamic StudiesUniversity of California, Los Angeles, 2012Professor Khaled Abou El-Fadl, ChairThis dissertation is a historical research in the formation of the first Islamic State during the era of the Prophet Mu&#7717;ammad (ca. 622-32 CE). While many academic works have referred to it largely within either biographical (e.g. `the life of Mu&#7717;ammad' and the like) or mega-historical conceptual frameworks (e.g. `the history of Islam' etc), few have focused exclusively on the political context of the rise of Islam in the seventh century CE. Utilizing an interdisciplinary approach drawn from the social sciences, especially political anthropology, history and political science, and the Islamic sciences, I describe the various cultural processes involved in the founding of the early Islamic State and its structure, including an in-depth examination of the local Arabian and regional political environments, the make-up of Arabian society and religion, the Makkan opposition to Islam, the Muslim response to persecution, and how the Qur'an undermined ultimately undermined order and authority in Makka. Also explored in this research are the policy functions of the Islamic State, that is, its conduct, including its relations with non-Muslims, law, warfare, political economy, and foreign relations, which are interpreted through an explanatory framework based on the system's idéologique or native logicality. Last but not least, aspects of the nascent Muslim body politic that are distinctively Islamic are highlighted, such as its innovative notion of rulership (namely, the prophet or messenger of God as a political agent who exercises &#7717;ukm Allah or `rule by that which God has revealed'), the concept of Sharia or divine law, the non-distinction of the religious and the secular or spiritual and temporal domains of society, and the practical demonstration of its uncompromising monotheistic theology as a political ideology and mode of governance.

Claiming victims : the Mann Act, gender, and class in the American West, 1910-1930s
Claiming Victims explores the relationship between law and society through an examination of the Mann "White Slave" Act. In 1910, the Mann Act made it a felony to take a woman across state lines for "immoral" purposes. Although this federal law was ostensibly aimed at ending forced prostitution, it quickly became a way of regulating sexuality. Men who traveled interstate with women while engaged in consensual, noncommercial relationships were subject to arrest and, if convicted, often received significant prison sentences. Despite the consensual nature of many of these interstate affairs, the women were legally defined as "victims" of the men who transported them. This study investigates gender, class, and race in the early twentieth century through an analysis of Mann Act prosecutions in the American west, where people were charged with violations at a disproportionately high rate from 1910-1930. In the West, defendants in Mann Act cases were primarily white and native-born, despite the white slavery rhetoric that envisioned foreign-born men as the main purveyors of the trade in women. Claiming Victims argues that the Mann Act centered on the idea that women were easily victimized and needed to be protected, particularly from the men whose sexual affairs threatened to undermine the home and family. Therefore, Mann Act prosecutions reinforced a Victorian ideal of male respectability, even as late as the 1920s. The Mann Act limited the mobility of the people who seemed to pose the greatest threat to the middle-class ideal of a respectable social order: the male and female laborers who migrated in large numbers throughout the West. The use of the Mann Act to control movement and regulate sexuality was not solely an overreaching on the part of the FBI or federal government, but was demanded by the large numbers of Americans who reported potential Mann Act violations. The level of control implemented through the Mann Act was a direct result of ordinary citizens' requests for the intervention of the federal government. Therefore, the enforcement of the Mann Act during the 1910s and 1920s was part of a larger struggle over how to define and enforce moral behavior and respectable gender roles in the midst of rapid social change

Immigration Control in the Age of Migration
This dissertation examines how polities are being transformed by, and are responding to, increased global migration focusing on the immigration control policies of advanced industrialized democracies. It argues that increased global migration has reaffirmed and entrenched the exclusionary prerogatives of immigration control, meaning the sovereign right of states to "keep out the other." This has led to a tightening of citizenship and a narrowing of the boundaries of political and societal inclusion. I provide evidence of this using a mixed methods multi-level analysis that focuses on the nexus between emergent human rights norms, global migratory trends, and state policies directed towards irregular (i.e., undocumented/illegal) migrants. In weaving together this nexus, this dissertation bridges central debates about globalization and human rights in international relations with new research on immigration control in comparative politics. 	At the international level, in an analysis of 160 countries from 1990 to 2008, I find that human rights treaties that require states to extend fundamental rights to noncitizens are among the most poorly ratified treaties. But more than that, as immigration into a country increases even liberal democracies become less likely to ratify, as doing so may encourage more immigration. I then move to a comparative analysis of immigration control across Western democracies, focusing on deportation and immigration detention. This dissertation is among the first to analyze contemporary trends in these critical indicators of immigration control across countries and over time. I find that economic and migration factors only partially explain trends in deportation and detention. Rather, it is the legislative representation of the far right that significantly increases the restrictiveness of immigration control. In examining how the far right "matters," I find that the political opportunities created by electoral rules explain the impact of the far right more so than public demand for more restrictive policies. Moreover, while there is no clear evidence that more immigration control means less immigration, there is some evidence to suggest that it does result in less asylum inflows. Lastly, I examine the microfoundations of immigration control using in-depth interviews with immigration enforcement officials and irregular migrants. I introduce a theory of selective immigration control that views immigration enforcement as a suboptimal outcome that is constrained by institutional and individual-level factors that make certain categories of migrants more or less deportable. As a result, those who are "easiest" to remove become disproportionately the targets of immigration enforcement; these are often the most vulnerable migrants.

Unions, Job Training, and the Wages of Foreign-Born Workers in the U.S.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the share of foreign-born workers in the labor market increased from 14\% to 17\%  between 1994 to 2008. At the same time, foreign-born union members increased, from 9\% to 11\%. Immigrants in the United States are an economically disadvantaged group in the labor market. Previous studies suggest that union members and other workers covered by collective agreements receive union wage premiums about 15 percent over nonunion members in the United States. Joining unions could be a good approach for foreign-born workers to receive higher wages. In this connection, the goal of this paper is twofold: one, to estimate the willingness of foreign-born workers to join unions, and two, to determine the union wage premium for foreign-born workers and whether there is a statistical difference in the union relative wage effect for foreign- and native-born workers. The results show that foreign-born workers have a lower probability of joining unions, ceteris paribus. The wage differential between union and nonunion workers for foreign-born workers is only 11.3\%, while that for native-born workers is 13.3\%. This 2-percent difference of the union impact on wages of native- and foreign-born workers is statistically significant. Among the foreign-born workers, Mexicans have the highest union relative wage effect (22.4\%). This study also finds that the union/nonunion wage differentials for both female foreign- and native-born workers are smaller than those for their male counterparts. Moreover, the union wage premium is greater for foreign-born workers in the private sector than for those in the public sector. By region, unions have higher wage impact in the West Coast than in the East Coast.In light of the numerous criticisms leveled against estimating the wage differential between union and nonunion workers using the ordinary least squares (OLS) method, this study estimates the union impact on wages of foreign-born and native-born workers using the propensity score matching (PSM) methodologies (nearest neighbor and kernel matching methods) proposed by Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983), and compares the results with those obtained using the OLS approach. The data on the wages and salaries of male workers aged 16 years and above are obtained from the Current Population Survey and span the period 1994-2008. Both the propensity score matching and OLS estimates indicate that the union/nonunion wage differentials for male foreign-born workers lie between 12\% (OLS) and 27\% (PSM). In addition, our results suggest that there is little difference in the union/nonunion wage differential between native- and foreign-born workers. The estimates of the union impact on wages using the propensity score matching technique are higher than those derived using OLS for both native- and foreign-born workers. Furthermore, among the foreign-born workers, the union relative wage effect is found to be higher for Mexican-born workers (26-42\%), while for Asian-born workers it is lower and statistically insignificant based on the OLS. Further decomposition of the data into three different skill groups (high school dropouts, those with a high school degree, and those with a college degree or higher) reveals that, in general, the less skilled (high school dropout) foreign-born workers have the greatest union wage impact. However, the union wage premium is relatively larger for highly skilled workers (with a college degree or higher) among Mexican-born workers.In chapter 3, we study the effect of job training on the US immigrant workers, using the 1996, 2001 and 2004, Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) data. We improve upon prior studies by setting up our training evaluation model, studying the impact of training on both the average and the distributional earning of workers, and comparing the differences in the return to training for immigrant and native workers by applying the Quantile regression (QREQ) model, the DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux (DFL) reweighting methods, and propensity score matching method (PSM). From our distribution study, we find that training has a positive effect on wages for immigrant workers for most parts of income distribution. The DFL reweighting technique shows that after removing all observable characteristics differences between trained and untrained workers, training still increases wage premium for both natives and immigrants throughout the income distribution. Our analysis provides strong evidence for the hypothesis that after corrected for observable characteristics differences between trained and untrained workers, the effect of training is relatively larger for rich natives, much larger for middle income natives and similar for the poor natives and immigrants. Furthermore, the PSM results show that the job training premium for foreign-born workers is between 0.063 and 0.184, whereas for native-born workers it is between 0.108 and 0.229. There is 4-percent difference in the job training premium between native and immigrant. All estimates are statistically significant. Our results suggest that OLS estimates underestimate the training premium.

"Please Do Not Feed the Homeless:" The Role of Stereotyping and Media Framing on the Criminalization of Homelessness
Homelessness is a critical social and economic problem in the U.S., with approximately 3.5 million people experiencing homelessness in a given year (National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty NLCHP, 2004). Over the past 25 years, many U.S. cities have adopted increasingly punitive policies (e.g., sleeping bans, restrictions on sharing food with homeless people) to address rising rates of homelessness and people living in public spaces (National Coalition for the Homeless NCH, 2006). Media representations of homelessness play an important role in fostering support for anti-homeless ordinances (e.g., Kendall, 2005; Iyengar, 1990).  This study examined media framing of homeless people and policies related to homelessness in five U.S. cities. Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Orlando were selected for analysis based on their ranking as three of the top "ten meanest cities" for homeless people in the report, Homes not Handcuffs: The Criminalization of Homelessness in U.S. Cities (NLCHP & NCH, 2009). Two progressive cities, Portland and Seattle, were chosen as contrasts to these "mean" cities. A content analysis of 402 newspaper articles and 184 editorials and op-eds from key periods surrounding the passage of restrictive homeless ordinances in each city was conducted. The overarching goals of the analysis were twofold: (1) to deconstruct the framing of homelessness in mainstream newspapers; and (2) to offer a social psychological analysis of relationships among stereotypes, attributions for homelessness, and the criminalization of homelessness. Findings indicate that homeless people were frequently described in terms of stigmatized characteristics (e.g., mentally ill) and behaviors (e.g., substance use, crime), while positive characterizations (e.g., hardworking) were rare. Moreover, policy discussions tended to focus on individual behaviors (e.g., panhandling, sleeping outdoors) rather than structural causes of homelessness (e.g., lack of affordable housing). Supporters of anti-homeless ordinances relied on stereotypes of homelessness and framed the issue as crime prevention and addressing public safety and health. Critics maintained that the policies violated civil liberties and emphasized the need for structural-level solutions. Implications for people experiencing homelessness and the consequences of restrictive homeless policies are discussed.

Acculturation Gaps in Latino Families: Prospective Family Mediators Associated with Child Outcomes
Acculturation presents several unique challenges that can influence the well-being of immigrant children and families. Previous research indicates that members of the same family tend to acculturate at different rates, with children acculturating faster than their parents, creating a parent-child acculturation gap (Phinney, Ong, & Madden, 2000; Szapocznik & Truss, 1978). There are many inconsistencies in regarding the potentially negative impact of the acculturation gap; in part, this may be due to variations in how acculturation is operationalized; on the other hand, it may also speak to the need to include and assess proposed mechanisms by which the acculturation gap may have a negative impact on children. This investigation examined the effect of overall acculturation and specific values gaps on child outcomes and family functioning.  Additionally, the mediating effect of family functioning was examined in order to identify potential mechanisms by which gaps influence child social, emotional, and behavioral competencies.  The sample included 89 immigrant Latino parent and adolescent dyads from the Southern California area.  Along with examining overall acculturation, participants reported on their adherence to core Latino values such as: familism, respect and traditional gender roles.  The family functioning constructs measured included: passive/inconsistent parenting, parental monitoring, accepting parenting, nurturing parenting practices, parental monitoring and parentification.  Finally, child outcomes included: self-control, social decision making, moral system of belief, positive sense of self, prosocial connectedness, depression and aggression.  Overall, the results were consistent with the current state of the acculturation gap literature.  Findings indicated that overall acculturation gaps were not significantly associated to any of the child outcomes or family functioning.  On the other hand, gaps on Latino values demonstrated to have negative effects on some child outcomes and family functioning. For example, familism-support was associated with low positive sense of self, low prosocial connectedness, depression, aggression, low parental monitoring, low accepting parenting, and low nurturing parenting.  Finally, family functioning demonstrated to be a significant mediator for some gaps and outcomes.  Specifically, familism-support was found to indirectly affect adolescent moral system of belief via accepting parenting.  In light of the results, limitations, implications and suggestions for future directions are discussed.

Las Anarquistas : the history of two women of the Partido Liberal Mexicano in early 20th Century Los Angeles
This thesis covers the history of the radical liberal and later anarchist Partido Liberal Mexicano (PLM) by concentrating on two women within the organization, María Talavera and Lucía Norman. By doing so, it disrupts the traditional narrative of the organization as centered on Ricardo Flores Magón and showing the women as much more than simply having a role in the party, but as placed in a gendered group where they slowly gained autonomy over time. The paper follows the two women through two periods in Los Angeles, first noting their emergence in the PLM, and considering their place in the party as compared to the rhetoric established by male party leaders. The second period shows how through each successive arrest, trial, and imprisonment of the men, the women gained power and leadership. Lastly, the paper ends examining where it falls in and how it diverges from the literature on gender in the Progressive Era, Mexican Revolution, and PLM, emphasizing these two women as independent and politically conscious individuals in the midst of the persecution of the party

Perceived neighborhood environmental attributes associated with adults' transport-related walking and cycling: Findings from the USA, Australia and Belgium
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Active transportation has the potential to contribute considerably to overall physical activity levels in adults and is likely to be influenced by neighborhood-related built environment characteristics. Previous studies that examined the associations between built environment attributes and active transportation, focused mainly on transport-related walking and were conducted within single countries, limiting environmental variability. We investigated the direction and shape of relationships of perceived neighborhood attributes with transport-related cycling and walking in three countries; and examined whether these associations differed by country and gender.
				
				
					
						Methods
					Data from the USA (Baltimore and Seattle), Australia (Adelaide) and Belgium (Ghent) were pooled. In total, 6,014 adults (20&#8211;65&#8201;years, 55.7% women) were recruited in high-/low-walkable and high-/low-income neighborhoods. All participants completed the Neighborhood Environmental Walkability Scale and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Generalized additive mixed models were used to estimate the strength and shape of the associations.
				
				
					
						Results
					Proximity to destinations, good walking and cycling facilities, perceiving difficulties in parking near local shopping areas, and perceived aesthetics were included in a &#8216;cyclability&#8217; index. This index was linearly positively related to transport-related cycling and no gender- or country-differences were observed. The &#8216;walkability&#8217; index consisted of perceived residential density, land use mix access, proximity of destinations and aesthetics. A non-linear positive relationship with transport-related walking was found. This association was stronger in women than in men, and country-specific associations were identified: the strongest association was observed in Seattle, the weakest in Adelaide. In Ghent, the association weakened at higher levels of walkability.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					For cycling, consistent correlates were found in the three countries, but associations were less straightforward for transport-related walking. Moreover, the identified neighborhood environmental correlates were different for walking compared to cycling. In order to further clarify the shape of these associations and reach more specific international guidelines for developing walkable and bikeable neighborhoods, future studies should include even more countries to maximize environmental variability.

Toward a More Honest Public Reason Liberalism
Contemporary liberal philosophers have spent considerable time defending a public reason liberal politics in which citizens publicly deliberate about laws and policies but bracket their private moral, philosophical, and religious worldviews when doing so.  Instead of their parochial worldviews, citizens in the public forum are to deliberate about laws and policies using public reason - principles, values, and inquiry guidelines that all citizens can accept as free and equal.The current literature, however, makes oversimplifications in two areas, causing it to neglect serious obstacles facing a public reason liberal politics.  First, the literature oversimplifies the idea of a worldview, causing it to underplay the epistemic obstacles that face citizens in setting aside their parochial worldviews in politics.  Second, the literature oversimplifies the elements that go into arriving at a political solution, causing it to overlook the inability of public reason to arrive at and publicly justify answers to some political questions.This dissertation avoids these oversimplifications and, subsequently, offers a refined version of a public reason liberal politics that addresses the obstacles that these oversimplifications originally masked.  First, in light of a more detailed understanding of a worldview, a public reason liberal politics must work into its procedures formal segments in which participants exchange and attend to worldviews.  Second, in light of a more detailed understanding of the elements that go into reasoning to a political solution, a public reason liberal politics must work into its theoretical structure a convergence conception of public justification that can inform deliberative processes capable of reaching publicly justified political outcomes when public reason is incomplete.

Protecting Against Transit Crime: The Importance of the Built Environment
This chapter deals with an important citizen right: the ability to walk from home or work to the transit stop, or wait at a bus stop or on a station platform without the fear of being victimized. Crime and fear of crime unfortunately affect many aspects of everyday life in our cities. Transit crime is a rather persistent but underreported trend that scares and intimidates riders – particularly women. The majority of incidents represent public nuisance crimes. The majority of the victims are captive transit riders, frequently immigrant and poor. In Los Angeles some of the victims are even afraid to report transit crimes to the authorities lest they expose their illegal-resident status.
      In this chapter, we want to argue that planners and policy makers need to often scratch beyond the surface of official numbers and crime statistics. At the same time, relying on one theory to understand a complex urban phenomenon, such as crime, may often prove inadequate. In our case, we found two seemingly antithetical theories useful, but still needing validation with empirical data: compositional theories that cast attention on offenders, and ecological theories that focus on the context of crime. We discovered that to understand a problem that is largely invisible to authorities, we had to rely not only on crime reports but also extensive fieldwork, to combine quantitative and qualitative techniques, and go from the macro to the micro, from census data to first-hand observation, and surveys of riders.

Extending marriage to same-sex couples in Illinois would generate up to $103 million in spending to the state and local economy. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, 23,049 same-sex couples live in Illinois. Of those couples, the report estimates that 50% (11,525 couples) would choose to marry in the first three years, a pattern that has been observed in Massachusetts and elsewhere. Of the couples that will marry, 64% of those marriages will occur during the first year, 21% in the second year and 15% in the third year.
      In the first three years of extending marriage to same-sex couples, the study estimates that the state’s wedding business would see an increase by $74 million, and an increase of $29 million in tourism expenditures made by out-of-town guests over the same period; total state and local tax revenue would rise by $8.5 million, including an estimated $1-2 million in local sales taxes. The first year would produce $5.4 million of this spending; the boost in wedding spending will generate approximately 281 jobs in the state.

The Good, the Bad, and the Beautiful: Motherhood, Occupational Prestige and the Roles of Women in Hollywood Films of the 1940s and 1950s
Cultural stereotypes and controlling images have been imbedded in the context of  U.S. cinema, especially since the end of the second world war. Women have been disempowered and marginalized by these images.  It is important to explore the existence and prevalence of these images in order to understand the impact this medium has on women's occupational choices. It is particularly important to study the cultural expectations of motherhood for women, and the influence post-World War II films has had on occupational gender role expectations  A feminist content analysis of the themes present in 104 U.S. films from the years 1939 to 1959, along with 11 remade versions (1978 to 2008) of films in the sample was conducted as a means to find evidence in support of intersectional feminist theory's position in regard to female representation in film, and the extent to which this representation has changed over time. The review of the 1,150 lead characters in the 115 films was done through the use of a content review sheet which was developed by the researcher through the use of prior research and previously used review sheets in studies using similar research designs. The analysis revealed themes including but not limited to the idea that careers should be secondary to romantic and marital relationships in women's lives; women appear in significantly fewer numbers than men in primary roles; women of color were portrayed characters who served white women; women are portrayed more often as mothers during the 1950s. In addition, women of ethnicities other than White are not adequately represented in the films, much less with regard to career choices. The films project the message that white women are secondary to men in one more area of society and that, women of color are secondary to white women.

Persistent Racial Wage Inequality
This paper attempts to understand the forces that have lead to persistent racial wage inequality by developing a dynamic model of statistical discrimination that accounts for the transmission of earnings across generations. The parameters of this model are then estimated using data from the 1970 and 1990 U.S. Census. The results indicate that racial disparities in the quality of information that firms receive about worker productivity are the primary cause of racial wage inequality in 1990. The results also indicate that neither the persistence of income across generations nor the presence of coordination failures explains a sizable fraction of ongoing inequality.

Who Belongs?: Immigration Outside the Law and the Idea of Americans in Waiting
This essay addresses a central question in immigration law and policy: when immigrants are unlawfully present in the United States, how if at all might they make persuasive claims to legalization or some other recognition in the form of immigration law status? Part I sets out an analytical framework that shows how viewing immigrants — including unauthorized migrants — as Americans in waiting is essential to reconciling a central tension in immigration and citizenship law generally. This is the tension between national borders and a sense of justice that is defined largely by a national commitment to equality. Part II analyzes how, in the historical context of U.S. immigration and citizenship laws, immigrants have — or have not — been treated as Americans in waiting whose integration should be fostered. Part III suggests ways to think about possible claims by unauthorized migrants to lawful immigration status and eventually to U.S. citizenship. The conclusion sets out a brief agenda for further thought.

Culturing revolution : the local Communists of China's Hainan Island
Hainan is the smallest province, largest island, and southernmost territory administered by the People's Republic of China (PRC). In May of 1950, seven months after the founding of the PRC, a military conquest brought Hainan under the control of the new regime. The campaign was successful as a result of coordination between mainland forces crossing the narrow strait in a flotilla of fishing boats, and a local Communist guerrilla force that had been fighting for over two decades to help bring about this victory. In the months and years that followed this campaign, conflict developed between the local Communist leaders and their new mainland masters. This study aims to explain the foundation of the local Hainan Communist movement, its precedents, its early development, and its survival on the island

Commuting Distance Sensitivity by Race and Socio-Economic Status
Previous research has shown that households are sensitive to commuting distance. A model of the responses to work-residence separation showed that the probability of moving closer to the job was a function of increasing distance from the work place. In particular, households beyond a threshold distance moved closer to the job when they changed residence. The question which is central in this paper is how race affects the probability of moving closer to the job when households change residence. Using a specialized data set the research shows that the commuting behaviors of relatively affluent minority and white households are consistent with the overall hypothesis that households minimize their commuting distance whenever possible. Thus, when we hold socio-economic status constant, there are negligible differences int he responses of white and minority households. Both household types are likely to move closer to their work locations with greater distances from the work location.

Neoliberal captivity : criminalization of Latina migrants and the construction of irrecuperability
This study generates a discussion between the immigrant rights movement and the prison abolition movement. The dialogue bridges contemporary migrant criminalization, imprisonment, detention, and family separation, to the longer history of imprisonment of Blacks in the U.S. It attempts to displace exceptionalist readings of migrant policing and detention and demonstrate how these population control practices are made possible through the ideological and material labor developed in response to post-Civil Rights Black rebelliousness. Specifically, it considers the criminalization of state dependency that was attributed to Black women who were marked as "breeders" of criminality. These constructions provided ideological fuel for the neoliberal transformation of the early 1970s that resulted in constructing Blacks as expendable within the U.S. labor market and reliance on imprisonment as a solution to the creation of expendable bodies. This development was accompanied with a shift in migrant labor relations, moving largely from the Bracero Program, which relied on contracted migrant laborers, to undocumented workers. The expansion of the service economy in the U.S. and changes in federal immigration legislation of 1986 increased the presence of migrant women. Nativist fears generated over the permanent settlement of migrant women and their families drew from existing tropes about Black motherhood and criminalized migrants, in large part through the notion of "public charges." Similar to Blacks, the response is increased reliance on the criminal justice system, which resulted in Latina/o migrants constituting the largest ethnic group in federal prison. Drawing from the experiences of jailed, imprisoned, detained, and deported migrant women gathered through an interdisciplinary research methodology consisting of ethnography, archives, media discourse analysis, and interviews, this dissertation demonstrates that migrant women's criminalization is central in regulating racial neoliberal labor relations. Their criminalization constructs them as irrecuperable subjects, separating their productive form their reproductive labors. A critical feminist conceptualization of U.S. captivity is advanced in this study and it accounts for the centrality of migrant women's bodies in maintaining U.S. global dominance. Nativist discourse marks migrant women's bodies as the origins of an external racial threat. Immigration control policies serve to contain, and in the case of incarceration and deportation, dispose of "the threat."

Urban Intersections: Engaging Dualities in Shanghai
The absolute polarization of contextual and tabula rasa urban models has long been advanced, even blatantly promoted, within the discipline. Taken for granted as foils, the exclusive championing and application of context or tabula rasa has only served to undermine the agency of the contemporary city. Producing an ineffectual and one-dimensional duality, cities have been reduced to futilely choose between the old and the new. 

A city of contradictory extremes, the clash between these concepts is embodied in the urbanism of Shanghai. With the impetus of China’s “Economic Miracle,” a previously unheard of scale and speed of urbanization has been achieved throughout the country with the creation of “instant cities.”  Embraced as testing grounds for contemporary urbanism, the characteristics and conditions of the instant cities have been enthusiastically and almost universally adopted, leading to a primacy of tabula rasa and vertical development. Partially transformed by this model of erasure, Shanghai’s urbanism is defined by confrontation as the urban models of the past and present collide. The duality manifest by this conflict compels an examination of the seemingly agonistic roles of context and erasure in the city. 

The ambition of this thesis is to eliminate such distinctions; the choice between contextual and tabula rasa approaches does not work. This false choice produces either a conservative preservationist tourist attraction or a generic and totalizing vertical city. The shallow tendencies of both approaches threaten the city as a multiple and collective space of possibility. By adopting a broader view of context and collapsing present dualities, this project seeks to create complexity and new confrontations through an urban morphology shaped by architecture. Moving beyond contextual preservation and tabula rasa, this thesis seeks to engage and create another reality using that juxtaposition to open new relationships within the city.

The cultural politics of Evangelical Christianity in the Dominican Republic
My dissertation, The Cultural Politics of Evangelical Christianity in the Dominican Republic, is broadly concerned with questions of religion, identity and culture. Through ethnography, I explore the dynamic intersections of religious identity, culture and morality as they are lived in the context of urban poverty. Based on over two years of ethnographic fieldwork in Villa Altagracia, Dominican Republic, my dissertation examines the lives of Pentecostal community members and the ways in which they negotiate identity, status and power in the context of religious heterodoxy and Catholic cultural supremacy. My dissertation contributes new insight into the dynamics of religious heterodoxy and pluralism, religion as strategic identity, and Pentecostalism as an important social and cultural institution at the local level. Pentecostalism is the fastest growing religious denomination in the Dominican Republic. This dissertation is concerned with the social and cultural effects of this growth at the local level and the ways in which Dominicans put their faith to work in their everyday lives. Pentecostalism in the Dominican Republic, because it is an entrenched feature of barrio life, features prominently in everyday negotiations of identity, status, and power. As such, Pentecostalism is an important vector in identity politics at the local level as well as social process and communion throughout the country. In the first chapter of this dissertation I explore exchange in the religious field and the relationship between Catholicism, Dominican vodú, and Pentecostal Christianity in the barrio and show how meaning is both shared and contested at the local level. In the second chapter I outline a politics of distinction at the center of local Pentecostal practice and show how Evangelical identity enables converts to transcend hierarchies of stigmatizing difference. In the third chapter I explore the relationship between the church and youth gangs. I explain the simultaneous popularity of both institutions for young men and conclude that both offer residents popular alternative spaces for critical agency and oppositional culture. In the last chapter I locate Pentecostalism within the context of Dominican ideas about masculinity, fidelity, and morality and explain how believers use Christian identity to claim respect in their communities

Spatial Mismatch Outside of Large Urban Areas: An Analysis of Welfare Recipients in Fresno County, California
Numerous scholars assert that welfare recipients face a mismatch between their residential locations in inner-city or rural areas where they live far from employment opportunities located in the suburbs. However, the findings of this study bring into question the wholesale application of the spatial mismatch hypothesis to all welfare recipients. Welfare recipients in mid-sized cities such as Fresno, California, do not face spatial barriers to employment since they live in compact areas where distance between residential and employment locations are relatively short. In contrast, job access is important in the non-urbanized areas of Fresno County where welfare recipients who live in job-rich neighborhoods are more likely to be employed than recipients who are dispersed throughout more isolated, non-urbanized areas.

Encased encounters : remapping boundaries of U.S. and Mexican indigeneity
In our current historical moment, notions of citizenship and sovereignty are continually being called into question. Over the past two hundred years, processes of delimiting the cultural and geographic parameters of the U.S. and Mexican nation-states have played out in distinct but parallel ways. As the two countries that share the largest militarized border in the world, flows of migration, or rather the containment of these flows, has necessitated a clear demarcation of what constitutes indigenous people, and more importantly, indigenous landscapes. Citizenship in both countries has always been predicated upon how the nation-state imagines its borders, and whom it imagines as worthy of residing within those borders. This work maps the systemic and overt forms of racism that create current discourses and perceptions of indigeneity, analyzing how these forms continue to define and delimit nation-building projects today. Through centering an analysis of the National Museum of the American Indian in the United States and the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico, I link their institutional practices and representations of indigenous communities to larger historical developments and genealogies to reveal the way that structural racism and ideologies operate to manage and produce the ongoing "absent presence" of indigeneity. This project aims to move away from the notion of museums as sites of multicultural inclusion and public recognition to examine the ongoing problem and reconfiguring of "difference" in such spaces. Looking at the way that each museum facilitates navigation through spatial, as well as temporal boundaries, I then locate these navigations within larger historical and contemporary debates surrounding conflicting notions of state and Native sovereignty. I contend that museums are key sites for capturing, staging and authenticating indigenous identities, serving as important locations to examine the indigenous presence in larger national and discursive contexts. This dissertation asks the following questions : how do museums provide the groundwork for the imagined and symbolic landscapes through which we see, engage and encounter the indigenous presence in the early 21st century? How does an understanding of indigeneity in these two museums reveal much more about the present conditions of globalization, neoliberalism, diaspora, history and political sovereignty? How does apprehending the racialization of space and place allow for nuanced analyses of power and native subjectivities in the present -day?

Americans Abroad: A Global Diaspora?
This article uses the lens of diaspora to explore the understudied case of US emigration and the transnationalism of Americans residing abroad.  Although rarely recognized as such, native-born US citizens are also migrants who cross international borders, maintain close cultural and political ties to their homeland, and form social networks with their compatriots scattered across the globe.  Despite these "diasporic" tendencies, various peculiarities of the case (individual and national privilege high among them) render Americans unlikely subjects for the application of a concept commonly associated with coercion, trauma, and marginalization.  Nevertheless, this article maintains that (1) the inclusion of a counterintuitive but compatible case can sharpen the conceptualization of an already inflated term; and (2) the application of a counterintuitive framework can illuminate aspects of American mobility and belonging with significant implications for the host countries, the homeland, and the migrants themselves.

Interpersonal Influence on Political Behavior: Friendship and Peer Interaction
ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATIONInterpersonal Influence on Political Behavior: Friendship and Peer InteractionbyCharles Stanley HilliardDoctor of Philosophy, Graduate Program in Political ScienceUniversity of California, Riverside, August 2011Dr. Martin Johnson, Chairperson		Context and social interaction appear to affect people's political attitudes and behavior, but many of these effects and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.  I investigate the role played by friendship in social interaction and political influence, with particular attention to the potential moderating influence of gesture and other body language.	My research shows that the study of contextual effects, linked with an analysis of affective intimacy and gestures, provides a more complete understanding of the role of each in political learning and subsequent political behavior.  My research suggests that affective intimacy and certain kinds of gestures and other body language serves as important modifiers of other non-affective contextual effects.  I find that political discussants who are not affective intimates will measurably influence the political attitudes of each other as well as facilitate political learning to an extent not found in discussants who are also friends.  This is especially evident when I analyze gestures and other body language used between friends and non-friends and compare these gestures with the kind of language used within each group.  The language used and gestures employed are different between friends and non-friends.  Although the statistical results are inconclusive, my examination of the descriptive statistics along with my qualitative analysis of my 60 dyadic interactions suggests an inverse relationship between affective intimacy and the frequency of certain gestures and body language and the degree of political learning. Thus, the degree of friendship matters in political learning.  Political learning is much more than just a function of cognitive considerations alone. My analyses in the following chapters strongly suggest that important links do exist among political learning, friendship, and gestures.  In a dyadic political communicative exchange, I would posit that we could expect to find that political learning is higher among non-friends than friends.  I would argue that although this suggestion is not clearly supported by this research, this is more a function of the low statistical power of my experiment rather than an indication of a lack of any relationship.  I would also posit that the use of gestures in political discussion is more deliberate and formal among non- friends than friends and that non-friends are more "attentive" to each other than are friends and that it is precisely this deliberation in the use of gestures coupled with the greater attention paid by non-friends to each other that is, in part, causal of the greater learning between non-friends than with friends.

Using Community Surveys and Focus Groups to Inform Context Sensitive Design
Urban transportation planners need community involvement to design the urban transportation system for its users and for those who experience its spillovers and externalities, positive and negative. The people in the urban transportation system include travelers, residents of nearby neighborhoods, transit service providers, and others. These groups often overlap. This paper discusses methods and findings from an effort to involve residents in the planning for the redesign and revitalization of San Pablo Avenue, an urban arterial running along the eastern edge of the San Francisco Bay, California. The viewpoints of residents of neighborhoods of Oakland, Emeryville, Berkeley, Albany, Richmond, and El Cerrito, California, the six cities along the southern portion of the avenue, were gathered through resident surveys and focus groups. These residents experience the avenue as travelers and also as its neighbors, whose everyday lives are influenced by activities on the street. Resident surveys and focus groups show that even on a major arterial serving multiple jurisdictions, local residents account for a major share of shopping and personal business along the arterial, and local trips are a major portion of the pedestrian traffic, transit ridership, and auto use in the corridor. Further, residents have intimate knowledge of the way the street functions and malfunctions and can offer useful suggestions for street redesign, operational improvements, land use changes, and related social programs. The paper shows that context-sensitive design needs to respond not only to the physical environment but also to social and economic conditions, including neighborhood concerns and aspirations.

Legal subversives : African American lawyers in the Jim Crow South
This dissertation addresses one major theme : the nature of African American lawyers' work during Jim Crow, when the very system that created the need for their existence relied upon the myth of the innate inferiority of the race. Rather than focusing on well-known lawyers, "Legal Subversives" seeks to include lesser-known figures and local lawyers into the historiography of African Americans and the law. The inability of African Americans to enjoy access to legal educations within their states created a chasm between the African American masses and the proper level of legal representation required to address the needs of a population not long emancipated from enslavement. Previous books on lawyers have focused exclusively on elite lawyers, perhaps because of the easier availability of source material, and do not provide an adequate picture of the African American quest to attain professional credentials during Jim Crow. African American lawyers employed strategies in the Jim Crow era that provide evidence of paths not taken by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the mainstream, organized civil rights movement following Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. After Brown, civil rights became synonymous with Fourteenth Amendment equal protection claims. But local lawyers' legal approaches demonstrate a much broader conception of "civil rights" than would become the norm in later decades. "Legal Subversives" is also an attempt to engage discussions of the role African American professionals, in general, held during the period of legalized discrimination based on race. Lawyers operated within a different situation than other professionals; they often had to compete directly with white adversaries. Most professionals could retreat into the segregated community, avoiding regular contact with hostile whites; in contrast, lawyers had to protect client interests in court before white judges and juries. Lawyers complicate our narrative of the professional because they held an ambivalent position among various factions, white and African American, in southern communities

The politics of social spending in China : the role of career incentives
How does an authoritarian regime like China's ensure social welfare provision at the local level when there is no democratic accountability? Moreover, when local politicians are granted discretion to administer social policy, why do some follow the Center and increase social spending, while others ignore the central directive and spend money on other types of programs instead? Based on quantitative and qualitative data collected during 14 months of field research, I find that there is still accountability in China, but it works indirectly through the Center based on politicians' career ambitions. Ambitious provincial officials--those who seek to advance their careers at the central level--comply with central government mandates with respect to social welfare provision in order to impress Beijing and increase their chances for promotion. The evidence also suggests that politicians in China provide social goods in response to the demands of labor and to prevent labor unrest. Local officials would rather provide social security and welfare than education or health because "almost all protests are triggered by laborers unhappy about social security and welfare" (city official). Finally, contrary to what we expect, a province does not necessarily increase social welfare provision as the resources available to the province increases. Data shows that a 10% annual growth rate only results in a 0.6% increase in the province's social spending (as a share of total budget), while a 10% increase in provincial tax revenue actually reduces the provincial social spending by 7.4%. But when there is an ambitious provincial leader in the province, he/she increases the social spending (as a share of total budget) by at least 12.5%. As a sharp comparison, the demography and unemployment rate in a province do not explain how much the province spends on social policy. These findings show that the decision on social spending is not based on the people's need or the economic capability of the government, but the career incentives of the politicians

Feast of water : Christianity and the economic transformation of a Melanesian society
This dissertation is an ethnographic study of cultural and economic change in Auhelawa, a rural, indigenous society of southern Normanby Island (Milne Bay Province), Papua New Guinea. After a century of Australian colonial administration and postcolonial economic and social changes, people of Auhelawa feel as though their culture has undergone a profound and irreversible transformation away from an ethos of mutual interdependence and reciprocity and towards one of individualism and self- interested accumulation. I argue that participation in Christianity, brought by Australian missionaries in the early twentieth century, provides people with a frame of reflexive perception of their historical experience through a Christian cosmology that centers on individuals. In response to the perception of the negative effects of economic change, Auhelawa embrace their Christian congregations as a radically alternative basis for sociality. They believe that Christian sociality can contain the perceived negative effects of change, and they seek to use Christianity to create an alternative culture that can replace the social world of kinship and exchange. In general, I argue that Christianity, as a mode of reflexive perception and action, shapes the intercultural relationship between Auhelawa and Western culture of which it is itself a part. When perceived through the lens of Christianity, economic transformation becomes a self- fulfilling prophecy

Unit Social Cohesion in the Israeli Military as a Case Study of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”
The presence of openly gay soldiers does not undermine unit cohesion, according to a new statistical analysis of the Israel Defense Force (IDF). The study surveyed 417 male Israeli soldiers from 22 military installations. Statistical analysis of responses to the survey indicated that for both combat and non-combat units, the presence of openly gay troops in a unit had no relationship to the cohesiveness of the unit. Israel has allowed gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military since 1993.

Reconstructing households : the excavation of structure 45 at Lubaantun, Toledo District, Belize
The study of households or domestic groups is of relevance to the study of human cultures around the world as they are ideal locations for studying a complex range of behaviors across all socioeconomic strata. The exploration of households in archaeological contexts reveals valuable information about the nuanced functioning of society that is not always apparent from the excavation of monumental and public architecture. The following thesis presents a discussion of household archaeology in the Maya area, and the results from the TRIP excavation of Structure 45--a low, Late/Terminal Classic residential platform--at the site of Lubaantun, Belize. Extensive vertical and horizontal excavation was employed in order to explore the building, occupation, and use history of this structure. Excavation revealed that Structure 45 was an elite residential platform composed of four major phases of construction, and in antiquity most likely supported a perishable superstructure. Ceramic and lithic evidence suggest that it was the locus of food consumption activities but few activities related to food preparation or storage

The Cost of Security: Foreign Policy Concessions and Military Alliances
One way states can mitigate external threats is by entering into military alliances. However, threatened states are reluctant to enter into military alliances because alliance membership can require significant policy concessions. An important and unanswered question is: when will states be willing to make policy concessions in exchange for military alliances? This is the question that is investigated in this project. To address this question I develop a simple three actor bargaining model of alliance formation that endogenizes both external threat and policy concessions. I test the model's implications with two sets of large N analyses and find strong support for the hypotheses. The first set of empirical analyses uses a novel research design that takes into account the attributes of challengers to evaluate states' alliance formation decisions. The second set is based on the same research design and provides one of the first analyses of foreign policy concessions among alliance members. The results suggest that threatened states are willing to make more concessions in exchange for an alliance when they are unlikely to defeat their challengers alone and when their allies have a large effect on their probability of defeating their challengers. This research highlights both the security and non-security motivations for alliance formation and demonstrates that alliances have important influences beyond international security.

[environmental, religious, movement]

Examining the Impact of Religion on Environmentalism 1993-2010: Has the Religious Environmental Movement Made a Difference?
The view that emerged in the social science and religious literature is that Judeo-Christian tradition was in part responsible for the environmental crisis by fostering a "dominion mandate" or mastery-over-nature orientation. Despite the growing significance of the environmental movement, most church bodies had not addressed the problem officially until the early 1990s. Several national and faith-based organizations evolved to catalyze interest and organize the movement. This paper examines whether those efforts resulted in a significant change in environmental attitudes, beliefs, or behavior among the religiously involved. Using data from the General Social Survey for 1993, 2000, and 2010, results indicate that the respondents' denominational identification, grouped in terms of its liberal, moderate, or fundamentalist orientation, was weakly but significantly associated with several indicators of environmentalism for all three study years. These associations remain relatively consistent throughout this period, suggesting little change overall in the relationship between religious identification and environmental concern.

Variations in Fare Payment and Public Subsidy by Race and Ethnicity: An Examination of the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority
Transit agencies often pursue ostensibly race-neutral policies that, given both the cost structure of public transit and the systematic variations in ridership patterns by race/ethnicity, have racially disparate effects. This analysis explores this issue by examining whether the policies and practices of one agency -- the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) -- have disparate effects on minority and white passengers. Using data either collected or reported by the MTA, this analysis finds that, as a group, minority riders pay substantially more for MTA services and receive lower average taxpayer subsidies than do white riders. Specifically, this analysis shows that:
      1. Minorities pay a higher fare per mile for transit service than white patrons. Because (1) most MTA fares do not vary with distance and (2) minority passengers have shorter average trip lengths than white passengers.
      2. The average public subsidy per minority MTA passenger is less than the average subsidy per white passenger. Because minority passengers, as a group, use fewer expensive-to-provide express and rail transit services and more inexpensive-to-provide local bus service than white passengers, the average taxpayer subsidy of minority passengers is lower than for white passengers.
      As this study will show, these racial disparities stem largely from MTA policy decisions to (1) expand relatively expensive rail and commuter express services that serve a disproportionately white clientele and (2) adopt a generally flat fare structure that causes minority riders, who are more likely to make shorter trips on local buses, to cross-subsidize white riders, who are more likely to make longer trips on express buses and rail lines.

Fluid identities and connections : the effects of transnationalism and immigration on the cross-border political participation of Mexicans living in the United States
In 2006, Mexicans living abroad were allowed to vote in the Mexican presidential election for the first time ever. Though the event was highly anticipated, hardly anyone living abroad voted. Previous studies attributed the low voter turnout to difficult requirements and a lack of information, without paying attention to the experience of immigrating or an individual's connections back to Mexico. In this thesis, I explore how the experience of immigrating and transnational ties back to the home country affect an individual's decision to continue participating in politics across the border

Estimating the Effect of Sexism on Perceptions of Property, White-Collar, and Violent Crimes
Prior research on the role of gender in perceptions of crime and sentencing has focused primarily on judicial outcomes (i.e., empirical differences in male/female sentencing), and some theorists have proposed the chivalry thesis to explain differential outcomes for male and female offenders. Although a prominent theory, the empirical validity of the chivalry thesis has been under scrutiny for decades. In light of this, I argue that gender differences in sentencing can be understood through examination of sexist attitudes and beliefs, and how these sexist attitudes and beliefs interact with characteristics of the offense and the offender to influence perceptions of crime and appropriate sentencing.  To test this assertion, 671 respondents were assessed according to their sexist attitudes along both the benevolent and hostile dimensions of sexism, as well as to their perceptions of a series of violent, white collar, and property crime vignettes.  Sexism scores were hypothesized not only to share significant associations with respondent's perceptions of crime, but also to interact with the type of crime committed and the gender of the offender to influence respondent's perceptions of the crimes in the vignettes.  Results based on ordered logistic regressions suggest that both benevolent and hostile sexist attitudes interact with the type of crime committed and the gender of the offender to influence perceptions of crime seriousness, and sentence severity.  Furthermore, when controlling for type of crime and sexist attitudes, female offenders tended to be given harsher ratings than men for violent and property crimes. When controlling for crime type and the gender of the offender, respondents with higher benevolent sexism scores perceived violent and property crimes to be more serious and thought sentencing should be more severe than either non-sexists, or respondents with higher hostile sexism scores.  Finally, hostile sexists gave the harshest ratings for white-collar crime vignettes. Implications for existing theories and future studies are discussed.

Work and Car Ownership Among Welfare Recipients
This paper adds to the literature on work and welfare by examining the pivotal role of car ownership in facilitating employment among recipients of public assistance in California. In our automobile-oriented society, being dependent on public transportation significantly disadvantages many of this segment of the poor. As this nation moves forward to restructure the welfare system to promote employment for recipients, it is essential that policies and programs are developed from a sound understanding of the factors that are necessary to finding and holding a job, including the need for car-based transportation.

Relationships among  environment, movement, growth and survival  of coastal rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)
Individuals of the same species can vary dramatically in their size, physiology or behavior, thereby influencing their movement, growth and survival. Through influencing demographics individual variation is important to population resilience in the face of environmental change in space and time. Understanding the ecological consequences of individual and population variation is timely considering the dramatic rates of extinction and anthropogenic alterations we are witnessing including global climate change. Coastal rainbow trout <italic>(Oncorhynchus mykiss)<italic> express a dizzying range of variability in movement and growth rate. I used acoustic telemetry to determine the diversity of <italic>O. mykiss<italic> movement patterns in an altered river. Movement distance and frequency ranged widely from no movement over the 218d study period to traveling 170km to the Pacific Ocean in 14d. However, most individuals did not move more than 0.5km. Movement correlated with size, season and location. Mortality correlated with the number of moves rather than distance moved suggesting movement regardless of scale influenced survival. In laboratory experiments I found more northerly <italic>O. mykiss<italic> populations had growth optimals at colder temperatures than more southerly populations. However, temperature-dependent growth varied among populations at very local scales. Temperatures previously experienced did not affect temperature-dependent growth which is beneficial for a species that may experience dramatic fluctuations in temperature through space and time. I used a diet-switch experiment and model fitting to quantify the nitrogen isotope tissue turnover rate and discrimination factor for seven <italic>O. mykiss<italic> tissues. Among seven tissues, diet-tissue &#948;15N discrimination factors ranged from 1.3 to 3.4 /. Model supported tissue turnover half-lives ranged from 9.0 to 27.7 days. Using parameter estimates and their uncertainty, I developed stable isotope clocks to estimate the time since resource-shifts. A greater understanding of the extent and importance of individual and population-level variation in fundamental demographic (i.e. growth and survival) and life history (i.e. anadromy and thermal optima) parameters is key to the management and conservation of threatened species. This research revealed that <italic>O. mykiss<italic> populations vary in these fundamental parameters, implying the importance of local-scale management and conservation practices that ensure the continued diversity of these parameters within and among populations.

Reimaginig National Identity in Spain in Different Contemporary Narratives
The current study examines the multiple and contradictory representations or formulations of Spanish identity in a selection of contemporary novels, films, and plays, from the 1990s to the present, that explore concerns and questions about the status of Spain as a nation and its national identity. Some of the works analyzed here show the (re) construction of the national identity through a negotiation with the past. In other words, how nations are established upon a rich legacy of memories, past glories and sacrifices, heroes and epics, as well as many things that are forgotten. Also, the new challenges to the national identity in Spain, including recent issues related to immigration, are explored. The novels <italic>Huesos de Sodoma</italic> (2004) by Luis Antonio de Villena and <italic>Cosmofobia</italic> (2007) by Lucía Etxebarria are analyzed from the perspective of the (re) construction of the nation and the different voices coming to that (re ) construction. These authors focus on specific groups, such as; the gay community in the novel <italic>Huesos de Sodoma</italic>, and Lavapiés, a community in Madrid, in the novel <italic>Cosmofobia</italic>. Each space shows us an idea and appreciation of the nation, either through the early construction of the nation, or the analysis of a multicultural and multiethnic nation in which we live. The  films <italic>Las cartas de Alou</italic> (1990), by Montxo Armendáriz, and <italic>Saïd</italic> (1998), by Lorrenç Soler, open a space for the representation of immigrants. However, both authors provide an excuse to show the silenced aspect of the experiences lived by these new members of the nation when they come across a new different culture. Because of globalization and internationalization of the economic development, modern states are in the process of permanent change. The number of illegal immigrants grows and at the same time grows both racism and xenophobia. Thus, the dramatic plays <italic>Cachorros de negro mirar</italic> (1995), by Paloma Pedrero, and <italic>Salvajes</italic>, by José Luis Alonso de Santos, highlight aspects of immigration and racism in Spain in the early twentieth century. In the words of the characters, we realize their behaviors are based on residual configurations and distant past. In synthesis, I consider that it is possible to capture the meaning of a nation and its identity through the images that it projects and the fictions that it constructs.

Dando Vuelta el Año: Seasonality, Neoliberalism, and Personhood in Chile's Aconcagua Valley
This dissertation investigates how the aggressive implementation of neoliberal policies and practices in the agrarian sector of the Chilean economy from the late 1970s onwards has affected the ways in which female workers in the fruit industry navigate a labor regime marked by instability, high seasonal unemployment during the winter months, and structural constraints of the political and economic arenas in which they live.  Specifically, it is concerned with how female seasonal workers (temporeras), who constitute seventy percent of the agribusiness workforce, reconfigure their notions of personhood and create contested spaces as they enter and leave the fragmented agribusiness labor cycle in Chile's Aconcagua Valley.  It explores the articulations between the inherently unequal structures created by the neoliberal policies and practices of both the government and the agribusinesses of the Aconcagua Valley; the ways in which the state, agribusiness, and the workers themselves deploy notions of citizenship and responsibility; and the forms of negotiations employed by female workers as they forge social identities and quotidian practices during the fragmented labor cycle.	With the understanding that the expressions of neoliberalism are both varied and contested, the dissertation approaches the analysis dialectically.  The first domain considers how the neoliberal policies and practices underpinning Chile's fruit export industry were implemented in the early 70s and reinforced after the transition to democracy in the early 90s.  Second, the research gives voice to the temporeras as they engage with enabling and disabling attributes of flexibility, forging their personhood while confronting varying constructions of morality, sexuality, and citizenship in the work environment and national discourse.  Third, the dissertation examines how female workers respond to disciplinary practices in the packing plants, employ technologies of self, and engage in strategies of making do throughout the winter months, frequently recurring to debt as a way of making ends meet.

Households
The household was the basic unit of the Egyptian social organization, but its composition varies depending on administrative or sociological considerations: administrative records focus on nuclear families while private sources stress the importance of the extended family. Households included people linked by family ties but also serfs, clients, dependants and “friends”, sometimes encompassing hundreds of persons. As for their sources of wealth, they consisted of patrimonial and institutional goods, and household strategies tried to keep and enlarge them within the family. Nevertheless, menaces like debts, shortages or disputes over inheritances could lead them to their disappearance. Hence the importance of ideological values which tied together their members while celebrating their cohesion, autonomy and genealogical pride.

Affiliative and Sexual Differences Between a Reproductive and a Nonresponsive
A heterosexual group of nonreproductive rhesus (Macaca 
         mulatto) containing vasectomized males was compared with a matched control group containing intact males. Comparisons were made on data collected before the birth of the first infant in the control group. Three Darwinian a priori hypotheses were used to predict differences between groups. The first hypothesis correctly predicted more affiliative and sexual behavior among experimental heterosexual dyads. The results did not support the second hypothesis that predicted less affiliation between experimental males. The third hypothesis correctly predicted that heterosexual affiliation and sexual behavior would occur between more of the possible heterosexual dyads in the experimental group. Two-tailed tests showed the females in the reproductive group engaged in significantly less intrasexual affiliation. The results suggest failure to reproduce has a causal influence on the affiliative and sexual interaction patterns of rhesus macaques.

The power of the ideology of gender equality and the limitations of state bureaucracy : paradoxes in the institutionalization of gender equality policies in South Korea
This research seeks to explain the paradoxes of policy efforts made by Ministry of Gender Equality and Family (MOGEF) in Korea. Korea established a Ministry to redress gender inequality and succeeded in passing numerous legislation guaranteeing formal equal rights for women, which won Korea a UN designation as an exemplary case. However, the paradox of the institutionalization of gender equality within a special unit for the promotion of women was that the more powerful the institution became, the less ideological freedom it enjoyed. Thus, even with the progressive feminist activism's support and the institution's improved status, they failed to reach many of their gender equality goals and to change gender norms and practices through which the labor market and the modern family operate. Specifically, employment policies created more employment for women in order to improve women's economic independence, but they also channeled them into female-typed low-paid occupations such as care workers. MOGEF's endeavors to bring greater equality among families through abolishing the concept of the family failed. MOGEF's efforts to increase men's responsibility within the family produced policy programs that did not go beyond a minimal change in the way men and women live. I distinguish five mechanisms that are responsible for the paradoxical policy outcomes- 1) competing state goals and MOGEF's pursuit of gender equality within the context of state-wide goals, 2) MOGEF's relationships with civil society as a democratic polity, 3) MOGEF as a ministry operating within the logic of bureaucracy in its search for power, 4) the strategic actions of the actors taking advantage of political and discursive opportunities, and 5) the co-existence of multiple versions of gender equality norms. These mechanisms resulted in MOGEF's dilemma. The endeavor to institutionalize gender equality within the state bureaucracy could result in crippling disadvantages in pursuing more fundamental changes to core gender equality norms. My account highlights the interaction between international and domestic conditions; non-linear development into gender equal society; and mechanisms of stage gender policy making, something which has been ignored in previous research on gender policies

Segregation by Racial and Demographic Group: Evidence from the San Francisco Bay Area
This paper considers residential segregation by race and by type of household in 1970 and 1980. The paper presents entropy indices of segregation fro the San Francisco Bay Area and its five metropolitan areas. The methodology permits an investigation of the effects of group definition upon segregation measures, and an analysis of the degree of independence in the segregation of households by race and demographic group. The results indicate that the levels of segregation by race and by household type have declined modestly during the 1970s, at least in this region. More importantly, however, the results indicate a remarkable independence in the spatial distribution of households by race and demographic group. Only a very small fraction of the observed levels of segregation by race could be 'explained' by the prior partitioning of households by demographic group. The principal results of the analysis are invariant to changes in the definition of racial or household groups.

Why are land reforms granting complete  property rights politically risky? Electoral  outcomes of Mexico's certification program
We analyze the impact on voting behavior of strengthening property rights over rural land. We use the 14 year nationwide rollout of a land certification program in Mexico (Procede) and match affected communities (ejidos) before and after the change in property rights with voting outcomes in corresponding electoral sections across six federal election cycles. We find that, in accordance with the investor class theory, granting complete property rights induced a conservative shift toward the pro-market party. This shift was strongest where vested interests created larger expected benefits from market-oriented policies as opposed to public-transfer policies. We also find that beneficiaries failed to reciprocate through votes to the benefactor party. We conclude that engaging in a land reform that grants complete property rights is only politically advantageous for a right-wing party, thus providing a rationale as to why so many land reforms done by autocratic governments remain incomplete.

The Potential Impact of a Strict Voter Identification Law on Transgender Voters in North Carolina
Transgender people who have transitioned to live in a gender different from the gender assigned to them at birth face unique obstacles to obtaining identification documents that reflect their correct gender. Transgender citizens with inaccurate identification may encounter obstacles to voting. An increasing number of U.S. states have adopted voter identification laws (voter ID laws), which require voters to prove their identity by providing an acceptable form of identification to poll workers before voting in an election. The strictest voter ID laws require voters to present government-issued photo ID at the polls. If North Carolina were to implement a strict photo ID law for voting, this law may create substantial barriers to voting and possible disenfranchisement for nearly 5,000 transgender residents of North Carolina.

Family Networks and Youth Access to Jobs
Some networks may be more useful than others in affecting labor market outcomes. In particular, social contacts who are employed may be more useful in job referral than those who are not employed. Also, social networks containing non minority workers or male workers may have better and more extensive labor market contacts. This paper considers indirect evidence on the importance of job access via networks for the employment of urban youth. We measure the extent to which probabilities of employment and industry affiliation for urban youth are related to proxies for their access to informal networks. Proxies for labor market contacts include the labor market circumstances of other household members -- mothers, fathers, and siblings -- key members of a youth's social network.
      The empirical analysis is based upon 1980 PUMS data with more than 55,000 observations on at-home youth in the 47 largest US metropolitan areas. The large sample permits us to test for differences across race and sex of youth and parent in determining youth labor market outcomes. Our results support the importance of family networks in facilitating youth access to job. We also find some evidence that male parents are more important in affecting youth employment. These effects vary by race and are more important for whites.

Using Conceptual Models in Ecosystem Restoration Decision Making: An Example from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, California
The Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta (the Delta) is located on the western edge of California’s Central Valley and is of critical ecological and economic importance. However, ecosystem alterations for human uses changed many of the Delta’s natural processes, and it is now considered in need of restoration. An approach was developed to evaluate and rank restoration actions in the Delta under the Ecosystem Restoration Program’s Delta Regional Ecosystem Restoration Implementation Plan (DRERIP). The DRERIP approach provides an explicit framework for evaluating restoration actions, using linked conceptual models, an action evaluation procedure, and a decision-support tool. Conceptual models allow scientists and managers to synthesize scientific information and make qualitative predictions about ecosystem function and restoration outcomes to guideand focus restoration efforts. The action evaluation procedure is a structured assessment of restoration actions. The procedure clearly describes actions to be evaluated, assesses the magnitude (importance and scale) and certainty of anticipated ecological outcomes, estimates degrees of worth (achieving intended outcomes) and risk (causing adverse consequences), evaluates the reversibility of the action, and identifies opportunities for learning. The values for worthiness, risk, reversibility, and learning opportunity are used in the decision- support tool to determine the fate of a proposed action. The decision-support tool is a structured decision tree that determines the disposition of an action: whether a restoration project should be discarded, revised with a different approach and re-evaluated, or implemented; and, if implemented, at what scale (targeted research, pilot project, or full implementation). The DRERIP approach provides managers with a valuable tool for restoration planning, and a foundation for integration with quantitative methods for a comprehensive ecosystem restoration plan.

Algorithmic Challenges In Social Media Search
The timeframe of my PhD studies has coincided with the emergence and worldwide spread of social media. These include blogging and microblogging platforms (e.g. Blogger.com and Twitter.com), social networking sites (e.g. Facebook.com and MySpace.com), as well as platforms that allow for the sharing and annotation of content (e.g. Flickr.com and YouTube.com).The popularity and versatility of social platforms has lead to the accumulationof overwhelming volumes of diverse information. As demonstrated by numerous research works, mining such data can further our understanding of these platforms and help us improve the online social experience of their users. My own work has focused on addressing some of the major algorithmic challenges that emerge in the process of mining social data.In particular, I have always found search-based problems to be the most intriguing. On a high-level, the primary objective of my research has been to bridge the gap between users and information in a social context. From a research point of view, I have always been interested in mining two particular types of corpora: graph structures and textual data, both of which are abundant in social media. In this document, I discuss the relevant problems that I have tackled during my studies. The discussion of each problem is accompanied by an appropriate formulation, algorithmic techniques for its solution, and extensive experimental evaluations.

Welfare-to-work transportation programs are premised on a conceptualization of the spatial mismatch hypothesis that focuses on the physical separation between the central city locations of welfare participants, rapidly expanding job opportunities in the suburbs, and the long commutes needed to connect them. Using data from three diverse California counties, this study examines welfare recipients' spatial access to employment. The study finds that the traditional notion of the spatial mismatch is less relevant to welfare recipients, many of whom live in counties in which the urban structure does not fit the simple model of poor, central-city neighborhoods and distant, job-rich suburbs. Many welfare recipients live in job-rich areas; others live in neighborhoods that are spatially isolated from employment. TO be effective, therefore, transportation policies must be tailored to the diverse characteristics of the neighborhoods in which welfare recipients live.

Challenging Cultural Essentialism: Gender, Power, and Family Politics Among Mothers, Sons, and Daughters-in-law Across Cultures
Using qualitative in-depth interviews with daughters-in-law, my dissertation engages a feminist analysis of gender and power dynamics in Taiwanese, Chinese American, and Mexican American families. A primary theoretical objective is to "research against cultural essentialism" as reflected in a tendency to view racial/ethnic minority families as homogeneous and without internal variation, thus reducing racial/ethnic family dynamics to ethnic values and ideals. This study challenges cultural essentialist assumptions that predominate in the family literature by identifying similarities among three groups, as well as variations within each group. Further, I consider how socio-structural factors account for between-group similarities and within-group variations. Chapter 1 interrogates how cultural values of filial piety inform Chinese American daughters-in-law's understanding of their relationship and power dynamics with immigrant Chinese American mothers-in-law. Ideals of filial respect accord limited authority to mothers-in-law who engage other mechanisms of power, such as their domestic expertise. Many respondents covertly resist by feigning compliance in the presence of their mother-in-law but disobeying in her absence. These findings suggest scholars should not assume Asian cultural ideals dictate actual family practices, or that ritualistic displays of deference indicate powerlessness.In chapter 2, I explore the stereotypes and ideologies daughters-in-law utilize in understanding and giving meaning to their relationships with their mother-in-law. Many women draw on the ideology of "intensive mothering" and "feminization of love" to describe their ideal of a good mother-in-law and utilize these ideologies to evaluate their mother-in-law. They frequently use their relationship with their mother as a "contrast structure" to explain that with their mother-in-law. I explore the implications of this comparison and how it can contribute to disappointments in the relationships of daughters- and mothers-in-law. I also explore how drawing on stereotypes and unrealistic expectation of the mother-in-law can exacerbate negative family relationships.Chapter 3 examines family power dynamics from the perspectives of Chinese American and Mexican American daughters-in-law. Findings indicate that childrearing is the most conflictual area for women and their mothers-in-law. When mothers-in-law offer unsolicited advice, some women interpret that as criticism. Many women want to change their mother-in-law's childcare methods; however, many feel they do not have the power to make such demands, especially those who rely on their mother-in-law for childcare. Spousal support is an important resource for women as some rely on their husband's authority to negotiate with their mother-in-law. Finally, despite possible conflicts, some women identify their mother-in-law as a source of support when she is perceived as willing to understand and help them work through marital problems.

Redundant causeways : an argument for metafunctional analysis
During the 2009 field season of the Chichén Itzá project, two causeways running parallel to each other connecting a large architectural group to two architectural groups within relative close proximity of each other, but not connected, were discovered. The causeways and architectural groups involved were mapped and a surface collection was performed, in order to determine the purpose of the sacbes. In this thesis I argue that the sacbes had a semiotic purpose that transcended the physical actions they allowed, by addressing semiotic implications of communicatory infrastructure contrasted with the data collected

Public ideologies and personal meaning-making in postcolonial Grenada
This ethnography of the small Eastern Caribbean nation of Grenada explores what it means to today's post-Revolution generation to be Grenadian. The dissertation is both a study of postcolonial nationalism and a person-centered exploration of meaning-making in the face of complex national narratives. Through an analysis of ethnographic data collected during fieldwork from 2006-2009, I examine the dynamics between dominant ideologies about the nation and the personal worlds of youth as they make sense of their lives and country. In the first part, I examine public representations of the nation and argue that there are two master narratives circulating about Grenada and its people. The "Isle of Spice" narrative is future- oriented, and utilizes development rhetoric to unite Grenadians as one people, one family, advancing toward a more independent and prosperous nation. The "Island of Conflict" narrative encompasses the nation's unsettled and violent past, especially the period of the Grenada Revolution (1979-1983), and depicts Grenadians as conflict -oriented and divided. What is the relationship between these two narratives in the minds of Grenadians? In the second half of the dissertation, I explore the personal worlds of thirteen Grenadian youth. Through open-ended, in -depth interviews, this person-centered approach considers how individuals process public narratives in light of lived experience. Their meaning-making processes suggest: (1) contradictory narratives are differently internalized to manage cognitive dissonance, (2) politically alienated and uneducated about history, the youth focus on Grenada's economy and development, (3) the dual narratives foster a strong pre- and post-Revolution generational divide, (4) the common emic perception that Grenadians have a weak national identity must be examined in the broader context of the region's history and contemporary global power relations. By holding both public and personal worlds in focus, it is possible to discern the complex implications of the ways in which individual minds make meaning of national ideologies and, in turn, inform the thrust of these evolving national narratives. As subjects and agents, Grenadians are engaged in an ongoing process of defining themselves and their nation in the face of dynamic internal and external social, political, and economic pressures

The making of modern Chinese politics : political culture, protest repertoires, and nationalism in the Sichuan Railway Protection Movement
My dissertation studies the Sichuan Railway Protection Movement in 1911. What I see in this movement is the invention of the new rhetoric and the new political repertoires (such as mass media, demonstrations, public meetings, speeches, and numerous revolutionary pamphlets) that emerged in China during the first decade of the twentieth century. The rhetoric centered on the issue of "quan," which included both political rights and economic rights. The discourse of tax became linked to notions of mastership (zhu) of the polity. Drawing upon archival sources, diaries, memoirs, correspondence, transcripts of meetings, bank reports, account books, and propaganda pamphlets and newspapers, I argue that the Railway Protection Movement in Sichuan entailed unprecedented grassroots participation. The movement experience was filtered through the media to create a new political community, which transformed the ways in which politics were conducted in China. To be more specific, the old, bureaucratic imperial political culture was abandoned in favor of a popular republicanism in which elected assemblymen, students, intellectuals, and other local elites collaborated and competed in creating a new polity and a new understanding of the Chinese nation. In a broader sense, my dissertation contributes to the understanding of how the world became a world of nation states and how Chinese people responded to that transformation

The effect of joint scheduling and diversity on a multi- user wireless communication system
Multiuser diversity gain usually increases with the number of independent users in a system and with the dynamic range of the channel fluctuation. To enhance the sum rate of a system, joint consideration of scheduling and traditional diversity schemes such as selection diversity, combining diversity, and coded diversity is addressed in past works. The basic principle of joint consideration is to enhance multiuser diversity gain by increasing the number of independent candidates for selection in direct proportion to the number of transmit or receive antennas, or by increasing the variation in the channels between the transmitter and receivers. In the first part of the dissertation, we consider joint scheduling and diversity with low feedback requirements to enhance the benefits of multiuser diversity in an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system. The OFDMA spectrum is assumed to consist of N_RB resource blocks and the reduced feedback scheme consistsof each user feeding back channel quality information (CQI) for only the best-N_FB resource blocks. Assuming largest normalized CQI scheduling and a general value for N_FB, we develop a unified framework to analyze the sum rate of the system for both the quantized and non-quantized CQI feedback schemes. Based on this framework, we provide closed-form expressions for the sum rate for three di®erent multi-antenna transmitter schemes; Transmit antenna selection, orthogonal space time block codes and cyclic delay diversity (CDD). Furthermore, we approximate the sum rate expression and determine the feedback ratio (N_FB/N_FB) required to achieve a sum rate comparable to the sum rate obtained by a full feedback scheme. In the second part of the dissertation, we examine the interplay between frequency selectivity and multiuser diversity in an OFDMA scheduling system. A scheduling unit block consists of contiguous multiple subcarriers. Users are scheduled based on their block average throughput in a proportional fair way. Multiuser diversity gain increases with the degree and dynamic range of channel °uctuations. However, a decrease of the block average throughput in a highly selective channel can lower the sum rate as well. In this part, we first study channel selectivity that is desirable for maximizing the maximum of the block average throughput of an arbitrary user. Based on this study, we then propose a method to determine per-user optimal cyclic delay when CDD is used to enhance the sum rate by increasing channel selectivity for a channel with limited frequency selectivity. We show that the throughput by the proposed technique is very close to the optimal sum rate possible with CDD. In the third part of the dissertation, we consider joint user scheduling and beamforming to enhance sum-rate performance in an interference-limited uplink cellular network, and propose three schemes for this purpose. Specifically, one method is to maximize the signal to generated interference and noise ratio and another is to maximize the signal to interference and noise ratio in the dual network. To improve the user- orthogonality between selected users, we also propose two- step user-selection procedure. We compare the proposed schemes with a conventional scheme which maximizes the signal to noise ratio or minimizes generated interference to other cells. We show that the proposed schemes outperform the conventional ones in most cases, and better exploit multiuser diversity in reducing inter-cell interference

[voter, vote, right]

Getting it right or playing it safe? : confusion, the status quo bias and correct voting in direct democracy
I argue that voters do quite well translating their preferences to votes in ballot proposition races vis-à-vis presidential elections. Overall voters get it right almost 80% of the time, and on some ballot measures more than 85% vote correctly. Though some initiatives are 'harder issues' (see Carmines and Stimson 1980) and voters are less successful at voting correctly on those issues, they still get it right upwards of 70% of the time. Confusion, while not a clear cause of a status quo bias in direct democracy, does impair the ability of voters to vote correctly. Conversely, voters who are aware of political cues or heuristics are better able to match their stated preferences with their votes or more simply, vote correctly. No matter your judgment about the levels of correct voting, the 80% that get it right is a good level or the 20% that get it wrong is mind blowingly unacceptable, it is a rare occurrence that election results would actually change if everyone voted correctly

Does land abandonment decrease species richness and abundance of plants and animals in Mediterranean pastures, arable lands and permanent croplands?
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Obscured by the more prevalent discussion of intensification and expansion of agricultural land, the impacts of the abandonment of many grasslands and croplands of the world in recent decades have received limited attention in the literature. Land abandonment is a common phenomenon in the Mediterranean Basin, a global biodiversity hotspot, but little is known about the impacts of this process on biodiversity. To upscale existing case-study insight to a Pan-Mediterranean level, we plan to perform a systematic review of the effects of land abandonment on plant and animal richness and abundance in pastures, arable lands and permanent crops of the Mediterranean Basin. In particular, we ask (1) which taxonomic groups are most affected by land abandonment; (2) whether different spatial and temporal scales of studies influence species richness and abundance outcomes; (3) whether previous land use and current anthropogenic impacts on abandoned lands determine differences in the number and abundance of species; and (4) whether landscape context modifies the impacts.
				
				
					
						Methods
					Our review will be based on searching scientific databases as well as the internet for empirical studies on the effects of land abandonment on biodiversity in the Mediterranean Basin. Study selection follows a three-stage process and includes study quality assessment. Extracted data will be synthesized through meta-analysis. Results will be presented in the form of a quantitative (e.g. figures indicating effect sizes, tables summarizing heterogeneity statistics) and narrative synthesis. Additional aspects will be addressed through meta-regression and sub-group analyses.

Trade Unions and the Origins of the Union-Based Welfare State in Italy (1950s-1970s)
During the second half of the twentieth century, Italy, like many other European countries, experienced the birth and growth of a specific kind of welfare state. It was the consequence of various international influences in the context of the Cold War as well as the result of controversial actions of different internal actors. The purpose of this article is to explore the actions of some of these internal actors and their consequences for the definition of the Italian welfare state. 
      Specifically, the object of this essay is to identify the role played by trade unions in defining the Italian model of state social policy in the period following World War II. This essay proposes an interpretation which identifies trade unions as main actors in the consolidation, albeit difficult and slow, of the welfare system in Italy. Consequently, this enquiry into the “Italian way” also discusses some traditional explanations and classifications proposed in the literature about the welfare state, welfare regimes, and the welfare society. In particular, this essay introduces the concept of a “Union Based Welfare State” in order to describe the Italian experience and as a descriptive category useful for comparative analyses generally. 
      Following this working hypothesis, this article assesses one particular aspect of the complex framework of the Italian trade union experience after World War II. It offers a reconstruction of the debate and actions regarding the welfare state questions that feature the two most important Italian trade unions, the Confederazione Generale Italiana del Lavoro (Italian General Council of Labor) (CGIL) and the Confederazione Italiana Sindacati Lavoratori (Italian Confederation of Workers’ Unions) (CISL). 
      Moreover, in the essay, a description of the actions of the Istituto Nazionale di Assistenza Sociale (National Institute of Social Assistance) (INAS) and Istituto Nazionale Confederale di Assistenza (Confederated National Institute of Assistance) (INCA) also assists in the investigation of CISL and CGIL’s roles in the welfare state. INAS and INCA are the Patronati (trade union aid societies) of the CISL and CGIL and the tools by which trade unions deal with daily assistance and social security issues. To summarize, the final goal of this essay is to show how the Italian welfare state experience represents, in the European postwar context, an original “union way” which questions traditional descriptions of the Italian welfare state. In particular, it challenges the description of Italian social policy that uses only the categories of clientelism and familism and instead highlights elements of discontinuity and the central role of trade unions in social policy implementation.

A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Cinema: Shakespeare's Comedies in Film and Television
This project examines Shakespeare's comedy plays and the way they have been used as source material for twentieth and twenty-first century films. Three main questions guide the project: What was comedy in Shakespeare's time? How do modern and postmodern film adaptations of Shakespeare's comedies draw upon and transform early modern comic forms and conventions? What do these films--along with their marketing and reception--reveal about today's cultural values and identities such as gender, race, religion, and status? Genre theory and cultural studies form the theoretical foundation for the answers to these questions as each chapter examines one or more sets of films based on the comedies.The BBC Shakespeare Television series views the plays as early modern artifacts and makes traditional, but not entirely successful, versions of them. <italic>The Taming of the Shrew</italic> has found its way onto film multiple times. Usually the farce is turned into a "battle-of-the-sexes" style romantic comedy as the filmmakers attempt to bring to Katherine some sort of subjectivity. The supernatural elements of <italic>A Midsummer Night's Dream</italic> take over on film as filmmakers show off their technology by creating fantasy pieces. <italic>The Merchant of Venice</italic> and <italic>The Tempest</italic>, while comedies in early modern categorization, become more serious. In a post-Holocaust world, the character of Shylock becomes problematic and <italic>The Merchant of Venice</italic> becomes his tragedy. <italic>The Tempest</italic>, on the other hand, seems to be a treat for film directors as they concentrate on a solemn Prospero and the way he directs the action of the film. Finally, what was originally tragic can be fodder for comedy as adaptations and appropriations of <italic>Hamlet</italic> demonstrate. Whether it is a lion, a female brewery owner, or an action star, the audience recognizes the character and laughs at the incongruity of the comedy. All of these films negotiate how to present early modern concepts and characters in a way that will be palatable to a contemporary audience, and sometimes the ones that free themselves from the restrictions of their source best honor the spirit of the Bard.

The Relationship Between Social Behavior and Genital Swelling in Captive Female Chimpanzees:  Implications for Managing Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) Groups
This study was conducted as a portion of a project investigating relationships among reproductive cycling, aggression, and wounding in captive chimpanzees. Changes in behavior associated with the genital swelling of 11 adult female chimpanzees socially housed in four different groups were measured using 282 hours of data gathered within a 20-month period. The females' perineal swellings were rated daily using a five-point scale indicating level of tumescence. Behaviors recorded when the animals were detumescent were compared with behaviors when their sexual swellings were maximal. In addition to the subject's genital swelling rating, two factors, the male-to-female ratio in the groups and the presence or absence of a tumescent female other than the focal animal, were also included in the analysis. Multiple regression analysis revealed significant effects of each of the three factors. Significantly higher levels of sexual behavior and lower levels of submission were associated with the tumescent stage of cycling. Scores for affiliation, aggression, abnormal behavior, inactivity, locomoting, and being followed did not vary significantly with swelling phase. Group structure (male-to-female ratios) affected affiliation, locomoting, being followed, and aggression levels. Affiliation, submission, and locomoting were influenced by the presence of a tumescent female in the group. Proximity to other adult females increased during the tumescent stage of swelling, but proximity to adult males did not change. The group structure and whether or not a tumescent female was present affected various aspects of proximity to all age/sex classes of group members. Some findings from this study may be explained by the long-term stability of group membership in the colony studied, and implications for colony management are discussed.

[benefit, labor, social, woman, dependent, insurance, security, adult, effect, earnings]

Essays in public and labor economics
This dissertation consists of three empirical papers exploring policy-relevant questions in Public Finance and Labor Economics. In particular, it inquires into social insurance programs, the purpose of which is to protect individuals against adverse events. More generous benefits, however, often lead to unintended behavioral responses even as they provide greater protection. This dissertation focuses on identifying and quantifying the distortionary effects of social insurance, providing an input to optimal design. The first chapter investigates the effect of Social Security dependent benefit provisions on the labor force participation of married women aged 25-54. Many provisions of the Social Security program may distort an individual's work incentive. In particular, the availability of dependent benefits may reduce the net return to work since secondary earners, who are likely to claim benefits based on their spouses' earnings records, pay the full payroll tax without receiving marginal benefits for additional earnings. I rely on differences in Social Security coverage among husbands by state and sector to identify the impact on the labor supply of their wives. The results show that married women tend to reduce their labor supply when dependent benefits are available, suggesting that changes in the Social Security system that strengthen the relationship between earnings and benefits would have a positive effect on the labor supply of married women. The second chapter analyzes how Social Security dependent benefit provisions affect women's divorce behavior. Under the current Social Security system, a divorced woman is eligible to receive dependent benefits based on her ex-spouse's earnings record if her marriage lasted at least 10 years and she remains unmarried after divorce. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, I estimate a discrete time duration model of the probability of divorce. The results suggest that married women are likely to delay divorce to preserve the option of receiving dependent benefits if their marriages are near 10 years duration. This effect is stronger for women whose earnings are much lower than their husbands' or whose predicted remarriage probabilities are low, so are those most likely to value the option. The final chapter examines the effect of extended parental coverage on young adults' labor market choices. Young adults aged 19-29 are significantly less likely to have health insurance since most family insurance policies cut off dependents when they turn 19 or finish college. In recent years, several states have expanded eligibility to allow young adults as old as 30 to remain covered under their parents' employer- provided health insurance. For those who qualify for these benefits, the expansion of parental coverage partially reduces the value of being employed by a firm that provides health insurance since adult children can now get health insurance through another channel. We employ quasi- experimental variation in the timing and generosity of states' eligibility rules to identify the effect of the policy change on young adults' labor market choices. Our results suggest that the expansion of parental coverage increases the group coverage rate and reduces labor supply among young adults, particularly in full-time employment

Assessing Persons, Situations and Behavior: Implications for Consistency, Congruence and Construal
Situations have important implications for behavior. Recognition of this obvious fact, coupled with the Person-Situation Debate, led to a surge of research on situations during the 1970s, but this research did not yield a useful technique for assessing or comparing the psychological properties of situations. After a hiatus in the 1980s and 1990s, research on situations has been recently reinvigorated (Reis, 2008; Wagerman & Funder, 2009), including the development of the Riverside Situational Q-Sort (RSQ: Wagerman & Funder, 2009). This dissertation puts the RSQ to the test in three different studies. In Study 1 the RSQ is used to assess psychological properties of situations participants experienced in their daily lives and to compute the degree to which those situations are similar to one another. The results indicate that participants behaved more consistently across those situations to the degree to which their situations were more similar. In Study 2 the RSQ is used to assess the properties of situations that promote congruence between one's personality and one's behavior. The results indicate that when a person is in psychological "weak" situations (Mischel, 1977; Snyder & Ickes, 1985) or in situations that promote autonomy, competence, and relatedness to others (Deci & Ryan, 1987), one is more likely to behave in accordance with his or her personality. In Study 3 the RSQ is used to investigate the relationship between personality and unique perceptions of psychological properties of situations. The results indicate that people who are high in well-being tend to view situations they encounter in their daily lives as more positive than people who are low on well-being, or high in negative trait affectivity. Extraverts tend to believe that they are center of attention more so than introverts do. Open people tend to see aesthetic beauty, intellectual stimuli, and lifestyle and political concerns where less open people may not. And narcissists tend to see their situations as opportunities to show off and control others more often than less narcissistic persons do. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the usefulness of the RSQ for assessing psychologically meaningful properties of situations and for testing psychological theory.

Vance's Commuting Analysis Extended to the Suburban Southwest: Tempe, Arizona
James E. Vance, Jr., (1960) showed that a community's character evolves as metropolitan intraurban transportation and local employers' labor needs change. Commuting patterns define a community's laborshed, the area from which employees are drawn, and employment field, the area in which residents work. This Tempe, Arizona, study demonstrates the applicability of Vance's concepts to present-day inner suburbs in Southwestern metropolitan areas using two modern procedures, a geographic information system analysis and sampling from employee commuting surveys collected by the metropolitan travel reduction program. While data availability may limit comparative studies, Tempe's 1990 extensive laborshed and smaller employment field reveal that this suburb is both a bedroom community and a satellite employment center.

Reviving Transit Corridors and Transit Riding
When parts of their freeway network were damaged by the recent earthquake, many Los Angelenos were forced to "take to the streets" - to drive on the numerous arterials and transit corridors that interlace the city. They discovered a forgotten commercial landscape of small retail establishments mixed with office and residential buildings, automobile dealerships, junkyards, parking lots, and vacant space. These corridors are not unique. They are typical urban landscapes that can be found in virtually all American cities. Prior to the construction of freeways they were the principal traffic and transit arteries of the city, and they still carry the largest share of transit traffic. Urban arterial corridors are the "in-between" spaces of the city. They connect centers with subcenters, and the latter with one another. In the multicentered urban expanse that is typical of the post-industrial American city. But these transit corridors have become unfriendly in transit riders.

The Decline in the Standard Employment Contract: Evidence from Ten Advanced Industrial Countries
There has been a great deal written about change in the nature of employment in advanced industrialized countries over the past two decades, but the economic data to substantiate this claim have been contradictory and/or ambiguous. Some analysts contend thatthe existing data show little or no change in job longevity or incidence of temporary work, thereby casting doubt on the claim that the standard contract of employment has eroded. This article examines the best available data from ten advanced industrial countries -- Australia, Japan, United States, Spain, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Denmark, United Kingdom and France. It looks at three of specific aspects of the standard employment contract: the growth ofnonstandard employment, the decline in job tenure, and the decline in union density and collective bargaining coverage. Overall, the data reveal changes in national labor marketsconsistent with the thesis that there has been a decline in standard employment practices. In particular, they show an increase in many forms of nonstandard employment in Europe, Japan, and Australia. In the United States, the trajectory concerning nonstandard employment is less clearly demonstrated due to definitional issues that are discussed. Nonetheless, the U.S. datareveal a significant increase in nonstandard employment amongst mid-career and older workers. The data also show a marked pattern of decline in union density and collective bargainingcoverage in all the countries studied.

She is perhaps best known for her work with the Ladder, the monthly magazine published by the daughters of Bilitis, the first national lesbian organization in the United States. Writing under the pseudonyms Gene Damon, Vern Niven, and Lennox Strong, Grier began contributing copy to the Ladder in 1957, and continued until 1968 when she assumed the role of editor, and then publisher, in 1970. in 1973, Grier co-founded Naiad Books, which later became Naiad Press, the preeminent lesbian book publisher that opened up lesbian writing to the world.

[court, official, kingdom]

Law Courts
Egyptian law courts originated as councils of officials, which, besides acting as judges, also had other administrative tasks. Accordingly, they were known by the rather unspecific terms DADAt (Old Kingdom and Middle Kingdom) or qnbt (Middle Kingdom until the beginning of the Late Period), which simply means “committee.” Their members are usually referred to as srw, “officials,” although more specific designations also occur. From the 26th  Dynasty onwards, the members of the courts seem to have been mainly, if not exclusively, priests with a specific juridical education, called wptjw, “judges.” From the New Kingdom onwards, a division into smaller local courts and great courts located in the capital(s) can be observed. Local courts dealt with minor cases of disputed property and petty crimes, which were punished with beatings, while the great courts attended to trials about land ownership, cases concerning officials, and crimes entailing heavier punishments like mutilation or the death penalty. This double system probably remained in action until the Ptolemaic Period when the local courts were integrated into a new system and the great courts were finally abolished and their role was taken over by Greek officials. Native Egyptian judicature fast declined under the Roman rule. Legal procedure changed little over time. Several laws about court procedure survive, which show that the conduct of cases was established in detail and that the judges had little scope for arbitrariness.

Equity and Environmental Justice in Sustainable Transportation: Toward A Research Agenda
Equity and environmental justice issues have again become prominent topics of debate in transportation planning and research in the last ten years. Advocates for environmental justice – for short, EJ – have made themselves highly visible in many transportation planning and decision-making processes, in some cases seeking seats at the table and in other cases using protest, political pressure, and legal action to force change. Transportation practitioners have responded in many different ways, in some cases by forming partnerships for new programs serving low income and minority populations and in other cases resisting the perceived challenges to their expertise and authority. Researchers have been heavily involved, providing technical documentation for and against the varying claims of the parties and examining EJ activities as a topic for research.

Moral worlds and therapeutic quests : a study of medical pluralism and treatment-seeking in the lower Amazon
This dissertation is about the social and psychocultural dimensions of medical pluralism and treatment seeking in Santarém, a rapidly growing municipality in the Brazilian Amazon. Based on a year-and-a-half of ethnographic fieldwork in urban and rural settings, it comparatively examines how popular religions and cosmopolitan health institutions define and manage (or fail to manage) sickness, psychosocial impairment, and emotional distress. It also reveals lived experiences of informants who seek out these therapeutic options and the processes through which quests for healing shape personal understandings of affliction and selfhood. This study contributes to emerging scholarship in anthropology that theorizes medical pluralism, not in terms of discrete cultural systems set in opposition to one another (e.g., traditional versus cosmopolitan medicine), but rather as an open system of dynamic relations between institutions and between institutions and care-seekers. This dissertation situates these processes within broader historical trends in the Amazon that have lead to significant patterns of urbanization, migration, and sociocultural complexity, contrary to popular stereotypes of the region. In this context, religious institutions such as Pentecostalism, Spiritism, Candomblé, and Umbanda have flourished and, along with secular health institutions, provide diverse social and symbolic resources for the needs of care-seekers. However, an examination of the ways that santarenos in these communities cognize illness and distress and seek care reveals how blurred the boundaries are between institutional ideologies and therapeutic practices. These domains are characterized as much by complementarity as by contradiction. In similar light, individual treatment seeking efforts do not unfold in any clear-cut fashion. Rather, informants find themselves caught up within epistemic entanglements, as they navigate moral worlds oriented to medicalized care, ritual forms of healing, and spirit mediumship. Case studies convey personal dilemmas that emerge from these entanglements, in which individuals strive to regain control of symptoms, of self- and social efficacy, and moral development. Psychocultural theories, including the work of culture and embodiment, provide a framework for understanding how differing cultural idioms articulate with these life-course themes, emotions, and sensory experiences, which together underpin expressions of flexibility in selfhood in response to social conditions of pluralism

Ciudad y México, en la obra literaria de José Joaquín Blanco : arquitectura discursiva y cartografía literaria en la transición neoliberal
This dissertation is an interdisciplinary study of the relationship between the discourses of spatial policy and literature during the neo-liberal transition experienced by Mexican society in the last three decades of the twentieth century. It investigates how space is socially organized through discourses of urban planning at a, national, regional, and metropolitan level. It posits that cartographic artifacts (cadastral maps, Atlas, theories of urban planning), together with an ensemble of spatial discourses in a (neo)liberal society, are both constitutive and constituent for the socio-economic and political system. Through the use of mapping, a State makes its territory legible, but also creates the material infrastructure for the system to operate, while simultaneously redrawing the Nation and its territory. Cultural producers, especially urban writers, keen to the nuances of lived experience and space, are at the forefront of not only documenting the changing landscape, but their literature points to how culture is mediated through this relationship with the social-spatial. Previous sociological, geographical, and literary urban studies have failed to go beyond a descriptive analysis of representation, this dissertation argues and shows that literature maps not only the changing landscape, but creates an alternative cultural cartography and public sphere for the critique of the cultural, ideological, and spatial apparatuses of the State and private enterprise that try to control the city, its organization, its relationships of production, and the ability to form subjects and their subjectivities; further more, it shows that in a period that redefines the concept of public space, the public sphere created in literature and culture can act as a cognitive map and model of cultural practices of resistance to the expanding neo-liberal commodification of daily life that the spatial discourses of the State and private enterprise make possible

Letting Down the Team? Social Effects of Team Incentives
This paper estimates social effects of incentivizing people in teams. In two fieldexperiments featuring exogenous team formation and opportunities for repeated socialinteractions, we find large team effects that operate through social channels. The teamcompensation system induced agents to choose effort as if they valued a marginal dollar ofcompensation for their teammate from two-thirds as much (in one study) to twice as much asthey valued a dollar of their own compensation (in the other study). We conclude that socialeffects of monetary team incentives exist and can induce effort at lower cost than through directindividual payment.

A multi-gene phylogeny of Cephalopoda supports convergent morphological evolution in association with multiple habitat shifts in the marine environment
AbstractBackgroundThe marine environment is comprised of numerous divergent organisms living under similar selective pressures, often resulting in the evolution of convergent structures such as the fusiform body shape of pelagic squids, fishes, and some marine mammals. However, little is known about the frequency of, and circumstances leading to, convergent evolution in the open ocean. Here, we present a comparative study of the molluscan class Cephalopoda, a marine group known to occupy habitats from the intertidal to the deep sea. Several lineages bear features that may coincide with a benthic or pelagic existence, making this a valuable group for testing hypotheses of correlated evolution. To test for convergence and correlation, we generate the most taxonomically comprehensive multi-gene phylogeny of cephalopods to date. We then create a character matrix of habitat type and morphological characters, which we use to infer ancestral character states and test for correlation between habitat and morphology.ResultsOur study utilizes a taxonomically well-sampled phylogeny to show convergent evolution in all six morphological characters we analyzed. Three of these characters also correlate with habitat. The presence of an autogenic photophore (those relying upon autonomous enzymatic light reactions) is correlated with a pelagic habitat, while the cornea and accessory nidamental gland correlate with a benthic lifestyle. Here, we present the first statistical tests for correlation between convergent traits and habitat in cephalopods to better understand the evolutionary history of characters that are adaptive in benthic or pelagic environments, respectively.DiscussionOur study supports the hypothesis that habitat has influenced convergent evolution in the marine environment: benthic organisms tend to exhibit similar characteristics that confer protection from invasion by other benthic taxa, while pelagic organisms possess features that facilitate crypsis and communication in an environment lacking physical refuges. Features that have originated multiple times in distantly related lineages are likely adaptive for the organisms inhabiting a particular environment: studying the frequency and evolutionary history of such convergent characters can increase understanding of the underlying forces driving ecological and evolutionary transitions in the marine environment.

The nation invisible : American civil religion and the American political tradition 1838- 1925
The tradition of American civil religion is core to American national identity and political thought. It has traditionally been studied in terms of how it works to integrate some groups into the American political community while excluding others. It has rarely been engaged with in a substantive fashion, taking into account the content and historical development of the civil religious tradition in America. In this dissertation, I argue that American civil religion is a continuous rhetorical tradition with a defined set of symbols, rituals, and tropes. Moreover, it is a level of discourse in American politics at which the issues of political sin and virtue, perfectibility, national telos, and ultimate ideals are addressed. It depicts the United States as having a particular relationship with God, akin to that depicted in the Old Testament between God and the ancient Israelites. An important difference between my work and the great majority of scholarship on American civil religion is the fact that it is more aligned with the legacy of Max Weber than it is with that of Emil Durkheim. Though I do not ignore questions of inclusion and exclusion in the American political community, my focus is on the ways in which a civil religious framework structures the way in which political figures act in the political sphere. Taking into account social, political, and theological influences, I examine in detail the speech of four pivotal figures in the post-Jacksonian development of American civil religion: John L. O'Sullivan, Abraham Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson, and William Jennings Bryan. I structure my examination of the civil religious framework of each of these men within three primary questions. One, does the individual prioritize liberty over equality, or vice versa? Two, where does he locate sin, and what is his understanding of that sin? Three, does he believe that the United States is obligated to model democracy to the world, or that the nation has a responsibility to actively proselytize democratic government? My dissertation is organized with a chapter on each of the above four men, except for Lincoln, the central figure in the American civil religious tradition. On Lincoln, I write two chapters, dividing his speech into priestly and prophetic strains, following the typology of Max Weber as adapted by Martin E. Marty

[polygamy, mormons]

The new and everlasting order of marriage : the introduction and implementation of Mormon polygamy : 1830-1856
When Joseph Smith quietly introduced polygamy to a few chosen followers in Nauvoo, Illinois in April 1841, the innovation was not welcomed by most adherents to Mormonism. How, then, did polygamy become the favored form of marriage in 19th century Mormon culture? The answer is that it happened through a complicated and contingent process that took many years. Early adherents expected the advent of the millennium, perhaps in their lifetime, and were thus primed to accept unusual doctrine, but their acceptance of polygamy nevertheless depended on the development of a supporting theological narrative that they found convincing. Since polygamy was introduced slowly and secretly through key members of the community, people were able to gradually become accustomed to the concept before they were formally asked to accept it. Polygamy, in turn, influenced the development of a family- centered theology of salvation and exaltation within Mormonism. It also caused considerable strife and dissension in the church and ultimately led to the 1844 arrest and murder of Joseph Smith. After his death, it played a significant role in the succession crisis that followed and in the decision to move to the American west where Mormons could establish their own society and marry as they chose. During the journey west and in early Utah, social norms and mores developed in a trial-and-error manner as individuals attempted to implement the new marriage patterns. Brigham Young and the hardy Mormons who trekked west with him eventually succeeded in institutionalizing polygamy, both in the theological narrative and in practice, to the degree that it became an important force in Mormon self-understanding and in community organization and cohesion. Mormons succeeded in institutionalizing polygamy so well that, just as they had resisted polygamy at the outset, many Mormons had a hard time giving it up after the church officially repudiated it in 1890. Sources include diaries, memoirs letters, pamphlets, minutes of meetings, sermons, newspaper accounts and a contemporary history of Mormonism compiled as events occurred

Voter competency, information, and campaign effects in representative and direct democracy
Are voters competent citizens? Existing evidence suggests that voters are both hopeless and surprisingly efficient. Some scholars find that the average voter does not possess the requisite knowledge to cast a competent vote. Others, still, have shown that individuals can capitalize on information shortcuts to arrive at a choice that approximates an informed decision. Our understanding of the depth (or shallowness) of voter knowledge and competence is, however, underdeveloped. In my dissertation, I ask three fundamental questions about the American voter. First, how does voter knowledge of politics compare to subjects that have a far more frequent, immediate, and intimate impact? Second, do voters employ information shortcuts to make reasoned choices as often as scholars have commonly assumed? Third, can voters learn from noisy and sometimes confusing campaigns? To answer these questions, I designed and conducted two election surveys in San Diego, California. For the first question, I conclude that voters knew more about politics when compared to everyday consumer and investment products. This result leads to two conclusions: first, scholars need to rethink how we measure knowledge, and second, voters may be better equipped to make political decisions than they are to make decisions at the grocery store. For the second question, I find that voters use information shortcuts much less often than scholars commonly assume. I also discovered, however, that most voters make reasoned choices regardless of how much they know about a policy. Moreover, simple policy changes can improve the usage rate of information shortcuts, which may lead to better decisions. For the third question, I discover that voters learned more about a ballot measure that had an active campaign when compared to an orphaned ballot measure that had no campaign. This result implies that campaigns, no matter how viral or convoluted, do help voters learn what they need to know

Crossing Borders:  International Migration in the New Century
The unending, global controversies over population movements across boundaries have spurred a burgeoning of migration scholarship, making it an exceptionally lively field. Though recent achievements are notable, significantly deepening our understanding of the phenomenon, migration scholarship has not reached its full potential. Its central handicap stems from the field’s distinctive division of labor, with one literature situated at the point of origin studyingemigrationand the other at the point of destination studyingimmigration. This essay seeks to reorient migration scholarship away from the dichotomy between “here” and “there”. Emphasizing the inherent, ongoing connections between home and host countries, the distinctively political nature of population movements across boundaries, and the continuing importance of the national interests and identities that impede migration, I argue that such a focus can illuminate the ways in which international migration is a dilemma for democratic societies worldwide, regardless of local peculiarities.

"Can You Hear me Now...Good!"  Feminism(s), the Public/Private Divide, and Citizens United v. FEC
This essay offers a critique -- inspired by feminism(s) --  of Citizens United v Federal Election Commission, 558 U.S. 310 (2010), a case which ruled that restrictions on direct expenditures of funds from corporate treasuries to support or oppose candidates for political office were unconstitutional restrictions on corporations' rights of free speech.
       In response, the essay proposes a two-pronged feminist attack against Citizens United.  The first prong is to acknowledge the dangers facing women and other disadvantaged groups which emerge due to corporate privatization of the public sphere and to argue, as an antidote, for a robustly construed public domain. Whereas early feminists identified as a threat to women the divide between public and private, Citizens United underscores a newer threat -- namely the elimination of that divide.  The second prong is to deploy feminism's well known rejection of abstraction in favour of context.  This approach helps demonstrate how Citizens United propels its pro-corporate outcome by erasing context and instead deploying a strategy of denying tremendously significant legal distinctions -- most crucially between living human beings and artificial legal entities.

Where Youth Live: Economic Effects of Urban Space on Employment Prospects
This paper summarizes and synthesizes a series of empirical analyses investigating the role of urban space in affecting minority employment outcomes. It adds to the considerable (but inconclusive) literature by broadening the focus beyond transportation and the “friction of space,” and by expanding the data available for spatial research.  The empirical analyses share a common framework linking “access” to youth labor market performance.  The first set of results is based on aggregate data relating access to employment outcomes for black youth at the metropolitan level. Access is broadly defined to include traditional measures of geographic distance, as well as measures of social isolation or social access.  Metropolitan areas in which the black poor are more spatially isolated are also found to have higher black youth unemployment rates. The second body of evidence relies on the same type of metropolitan measures, combined with individual data on youth living with at least one parent.  When individual and family characteristics are controlled for, and white and Hispanic youth are also considered, metropolitan measures of social access exert distinguishable effects upon youth employment -- youth living in urban areas in which they have less residential contact with whites or the non poor are less likely to be employed.  The final piece of analysis links the individual records of such youth to tract level measures of access, both social (neighborhood composition variables) and geographic (job access measures).  This is accomplished through the creation of a unique data set at the Bureau of the Census.  Again, after controlling for individual and family characteristics, the residential conditions of youth affect their employment.  Ceteris paribus, youth living in census tracts with fewer employed adults, with fewer whites, and which are further from jobs are less likely to be employed.  Results suggest that the overall effects of space on employment outcomes are substantial, explaining between ten and forty percent of the observed racial differences in employment in four urban areas examined.  Of this “spatial” effect, the bulk arises from social/informational measures; job access appears to play a much smaller role. However, when measured more precisely, at the census tract level, job access does have a significant effect on youth employment.  This effect is less important than other spatial influences.  Spatial influences are less important in explaining outcomes than are differences in human capital.

The architecture of power and sociopolitical complexity in northwestern Yucatan during the preclassic period
Recent archaeological explorations elsewhere in the northern Maya lowlands have provided enough evidence to state that social complexity emerged in this region as early as the second half of the Middle Preclassic period (approximately 1000-400/300BC). This has reformulated our understanding about northern Maya lowlands that had been considered as a peripheral place regard as the emergence of sociopolitical organization. Nowadays, the debate is concerned about the nature and level of sociopolitical organization of societies in northern Maya lowlands. That is whether they were at the level of chiefdom or state. I approach this problematic from the analysis of a public building, which I consider as embodying and expressing asymmetrical social relations. That is it is identified as architecture of power. A public building, Structure 1714, provides the means to test the models of political organization. Structure 1714 is located at Xamán Susulá, a middle-rank site in the three-tiered settlement pattern hierarchy of northwestern Yucatán, México. This building is the most largest and impressive of the site. It is characterized by the presence of the earliest throne reported in the entire Maya lowlands. The analysis of Structure 1714, in conjunction with the plan of the site and the regional settlement pattern, indicates that Xamán Susulá was organized at the level of chiefdom. Most importantly, I state that this society was an individualizing chiefdom that employed an exclusionary or network strategy of political integration

Gender Differences in Commuting: An Empirical Study of the Greater Los Angeles Metropolitan Area
Since the nineteen-seventies, as a byproduct of our rapidly changing social structure, gender equity has become a major concern. This concern and the increase in the female labor force participation rate and in the female commuting population has motivated scholars to analyze and explain male and female commuting differences. Despite the many studies of gender-based differences in commuting behavior over the past decade, scholars still have not been able to agree on the reasons males commute longer distances than females. A general consensus, except for the concerns of Gordon, Kumar and Richardson (1989), is that socioeconomic and spatial structures constrain females more than males, resulting in women having shorter commuting than males. With regard to socioeconomic constraints, the first thorough examination of those factors which possibly affect gender differences in commuting was done by Hanson and Johnston (1985). Later, the effect of household type was examined by Johnston-Anumonwo (1992) using the same data used by Hanson and Johnston (1985).

Irene Reti and HerBooks Lesbian Feminist Press
This volume, Irene Reti and HerBooks Feminist Press, is one of a trio of oral histories published by the Regional History Project documenting the history and archives of second-wave feminist presses on deposit in the University Library's Special Collections. They include Alta's history of Shameless Hussy Press and Sandra Kay Martz's, of Papier-Mache Press. The archives are part of the University of California/Stanford University History and Women's Studies Consortium California Feminist Presses Project whose mission is the preservation and documentation of feminist presses.
      Prior to her appointment at the Regional History Project, interviewee Irene Reti founded HerBooks in 1984. So she wears two hats in this project: she conducted the interviews with Alta and Martz; and was then interviewed herself as the founder of HerBooks, whose archive she donated to the University Library. HerBooks is a small, all-volunteer press, running on low overhead and publishing pioneering radical feminist titles. HerBooks blossomed within the milieu of feminism and lesbian literary culture and has survived with the support network of feminist presses, independent bookstores, and alternative book distribution. This volume consists of two interviews: one, by former UCSC student Martha Vickers, conducted in 1991, and the second, by Jacquelyn Marie, UCSC Reference/Women's Studies Librarian Emerita, who interviewed Reti in April 2001. As director of the Project, I edited the volume. Marie wrote me the following, describing her involvement in this project:
      As the Women's Studies librarian at UCSC, I initiated the California Feminist Presses Project with a colleague from UC Berkeley, as a special project within our UC/Stanford Consortium of History/Women's Studies librarians. Each campus collected the archives, including two copies of publications from all the California feminist presses. UCSC was committed to Shameless Hussy Press of Oakland, California, Papier-Mache Press from Watsonville, and HerBooks from Santa Cruz. All three publishers were interviewed. I have worked and consulted with Irene Reti through the years on writing and publishing, speaking on panels, producing bibliographies, designing posters and organizing exhibits. As a member of the feminist publishing/writing community since the 1970s, I have been particularly interested in a long-running, small press such as HerBooks. This press is especially important because of its lesbian/feminist stance. Irene has not hesitated to publish unknown lesbian writers who have highlighted a panoply of neglected and controversial issues. I was very excited to be able to interview her about her evolution as a publisher and writer.
      Reti graduated from UCSC in 1982 and founded HerBooks in 1984. Her path to publishing evolved quite organically as she knitted together her deep commitment to literature, her coming out as a lesbian, and her identity as a Jewish feminist. After she graduated from UCSC she held a series of nondescript jobs, one of which led her to learning typography and the mechanics of book publishing. This gave her a strong technical base as she launched HerBooks. She then became involved in the Santa Cruz literary scene and participated in several local writing groups. As she says in her oral history: "At the time there were a couple of literary magazines . . . I watched this process and thought . . . wait a second, I can do this! . . . the process of publishing a book didn't seem entirely mysterious to me anymore." She then published her first lesbian anthology and began her venture in what she describes as 'break-even publishing."
      In her narrative, Reti discusses the network of feminist publishers and writers with whom she has been involved, the genesis of the titles she has published over the years, her intuitive philosophy of why she publishes what she does, and her overview of the economics of small press publishing during the last two decades. She also gives an intimate overview of the singular literary community which has been thriving in Santa Cruz since the 1960s.
      HerBooks publications have included an eclectic variety of subjects ranging from serious feminist, lesbian political and cultural volumes (Childless by Choice: A Feminist Anthology (1992), Remember the Fire: Lesbian Sadomasochism in a Post-Nazi Holocaust World (1986), Unleashing Feminism: Critiquing Lesbian Sadomasochism in the Gay Nineties (1993), Carolyn Gage's The Second Coming of Joan of Arc and Other Plays (1994), A Transported Life: Memories of Kindertransport, the Oral History of Thea Feliks Eden (1995)) to more whimsical books such as Garden Variety Dykes: Lesbian Traditions in Gardening (1993) and Cats (and their Dykes) (1991).
      The HerBooks listing reflects the zeitgeist of radical feminist cultural and political concerns when these issues came to the forefront. The latest HerBooks publication as of this writing is Reti's The Keeper of Memory: A Memoir, a contemporary American bildungsroman which weaves together personal recollection, family history, the assimilationist impulses of her Holocaust refugee parents, and the author's discovery and reclamation of her Jewish identity.
      The HerBooks archive is at Special Collections, UC Santa Cruz library. A finding aid to the collection is available through the Online Archive of California.

[group, status, contribution]

Consensus and Contribution: Shared Status Hierarchies Promote Group Success
Recent research on status and group productivity has highlighted that status hierarchies encourage contributions to group efforts by rewarding contributors with enhanced status. However, that and other work has typically assumed that status hierarchies are widely agreed-upon among group members. Here we challenge this assumption, proposing that groups vary in their level of hierarchical consensus and that when groups fail to achieve high agreement, the status rewards motivating contributions are attenuated, undermining group performance. Results of two studies of task groups support our claims. We observed that status disagreements were quite common, particularly those in which two group members both viewed themselves as higher in status than the other, and that more dominant individuals were most likely to engage in these types of disagreements. Further, we found that such status disagreements led to diminished group performance and that this effect was driven by reduced contributions from the group members involved. These findings suggest that status consensus can vary substantially across groups, and that groups that are able to successfully coalesce around agreed-upon status hierarchies benefit from increased contributions and performance.

This paper investigates the association between greater income inequality, de-facto fiscalspace, and sovereign spreads. Using data from 50 countries in 2007, in 2009 and in 2011, wefind that higher income inequality is associated with a lower tax base, lower de-facto fiscalspace, and higher sovereign spreads.

The Impact of Affirmative Action Bans in Graduate Education
Foreward by Gary Orfield:
      This study by Dr. Liliana Garces raises an issue of great importance for both the nation’s future and the national debate over the necessity of affirmative action. America’s future depends on effectively competing in a global market and maintaining the world’s strong research capability. That capability is developed in graduate training at leading universities. As the nation passes through an historic demographic transformation and members of traditionally excluded racial and ethnic minorities make up a far larger proportion of the next generation, we are failing to train these students with the skills needed to sustain and expand our technology and research capacity. The most important tools for recruiting traditionally excluded students include a variety of affirmative action programs that identify and nurture talent among groups often denied equal opportunity to prepare for such training. All of our leading research universities and professional associations adopted such policies.As affirmative action has been banned in several states and the U.S. Supreme Court is set to consider the issue for the third time this fall in Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin (2011), it is vital to understand what impact the loss of affirmative action has had in particular states and to consider whether these states have found alternatives that maintain diversity without affirmative action. It is particularly important to consider graduate education since the major alternatives proposed for undergraduate access—the percent plan and admission by social and economic status—cannot be applied to graduate admissions where decisions are not made among students from a single state, undergraduate programs vary widely in terms of adequate preparation for graduate work, and students are admitted as adults, not on the basis of their family circumstances.If the need is truly urgent and the programs in states prohibiting affirmative action don’t work, the country’s ability to prepare its changing population to sustain and expand these critical capacities will be severely damaged. Dr. Garces’ important work suggests that this is a likely outcome.

The Bars That Bound Me: A Study of Female Parolees
Halfway houses are thought to benefit offenders as they transition out of prison into society yet research on transitional living facilities is lacking.  In this dissertation, I begin to address this gap in the literature by combining ethnographic observations of a state-funded halfway house for female parolees with interviews of women who reside there and the lead staff and interns that assisted them.  I found that the house rules and regulations, which are dictated by the funding source, can impede the residents' ability to successfully reintegrate into society and puts them at a greater risk of official sanction.  Nevertheless, most of my respondents were grateful for the opportunity to reside at the house because they lacked familial support and access to financial resources.	In this study, I also highlight my respondents' experiences immediately before and after their release from prison.  The majority of the women who lived at the house reported receiving little tangible assistance from pre-release counselors or parole agents.  Despite this, half of the women characterized their parole agent as helpful because he or she provided words of encouragement.  Likewise, those who described the halfway house as beneficial highlighted the emotional support they received from staff and social work interns.	In addition to investigating the residents' perceptions of the halfway house and their experiences before and after imprisonment, I also explore the social work interns' assumptions about the residents and their barriers to reentry.  When the interns began their internship they thought of the residents as dangerous criminals and they believed that the women merely needed to make better behavioral choices in order to avoid returning to prison.  However, by the end of their time at the house, they identified a number of challenges that made it difficult for their clients to successfully reintegrate, which suggests that folk theories are dynamic and influenced by interpersonal interactions.  This dissertation contributes to our understanding of how women experience reentry, how they perceive the services available to them, and how service providers respond to and interpret the challenges female parolees encounter.

'Alienating the Groove': Defamiliarization as Compositional Resource in  COUNTING (2012), for Large Ensemble and Solo Vocalists
<italic>COUNTING</italic> (2012), for large ensemble and amplified female vocal soloists, seeks to inspire critical listening through the invocation, alienation, and recombination of varied materials and techniques from contemporary concert music, popular styles (particularly funk music), and "folk" traditions. The text in <italic>COUNTING</italic>  comes from Jeremy Schmidt's poem "Censuspeak" (2011), a meditation on modes of enumeration and the "flatness" of the U.S. Census Bureau's promotional language.In an essay accompanying the full score of the piece, I discuss various "alienation techniques" at work in <italic>COUNTING</italic>, including the deployment of metrical instability, ambiguous harmonic centricity, rhythmic asymmetry, thematic fragmentation, interruptive formal patterning, and the layering of oppositional  musical materials. Drawing on a theoretical framework informed by analyses of works by Igor Stravinsky, Louis Andriessen, and Prince along with critical insights gleaned from Bertolt Brecht's theories of alienation and the "Epic Theater," I examine how these and other compositional approaches create a progression of defamiliarized musical contexts that stimulate critical engagement by "alienating the familiar." In particular, I focus on ways <italic>COUNTING</italic>  simultaneously cultivates and defies expectations relating to a sense of "groove." Finally, I discuss in detail the "neutral" structural role Schmidt's text ("Censuspeak") plays in the piece.

Essays on inference and strategic modeling
This dissertation presents three stand-alone contributions to econometric inference and the analysis of strategic behavior. Chapter 1 develops a structural econometric framework for first-price auctions that generalizes the assumption of Bayesian Nash Equilibrium within the context of a level-k behavioral model. The level-k model nests equilibrium by allowing bidders to best respond to heterogeneous beliefs about opponents' bidding strategies. I characterize conditions for identification of the distribution over valuations and bidder-types in populations with heterogeneous behavioral strategies. I propose a semi-nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator, establishing nonparametric consistency with an upper- semicontinuous population likelihood function, which I compute using a generalized expectation maximization algorithm. Presenting evidence from a pilot study of vintage computer auctions, I find a high level of bidder sophistication in the field. I also characterize expected revenues in first price auctions with level-k bidders, establishing a partial identification result for expected revenues in unidentified behavioral models. Empirical evidence suggests a misspecified equilibrium optimal reserve price could reduce expected revenues 30% relative to an unbinding reserve price. Chapter 2 introduces new Bayesian methods adapted to estimating a large-dimensional covariance matrix. I analyze the return generating process using an unrestricted factor model of covariance, imposing structure on the covariance matrix through prior beliefs on the parameters governing this process. I use these methods to provide an empirical Bayesian foundation for a general class of shrinkage estimators and use the shrinkage interpretation to characterize prior beliefs that optimize a posterior objective function. This estimation strategy delivers lower finite-sample loss than existing estimators in Monte Carlo simulations and performs well in minimum variance portfolio selection exercises. Chapter 3 analyzes conformist tendencies for a population in which individuals gain utility by mimicking the average behavior, characterizing norms by the mean behavior, thus introducing an endogenous mechanism for establishing social norms. Under this specification, social preferences generally give rise to more concentrated behavior and a conformist pool forms when social preferences are sufficiently prominent. In addition to illustrating the determinants of conformist behavior with an endogenous reference point, these findings support applied work inferring social norms from average behavior

Exclusion and Control in the Carceral State
Theorists of punishment typically construe the criminal justice system as the means to achieve retribution or to deter or otherwise prevent crime. But a close look at the way the American penal system actually operates makes clear the poor fit between these more conventional explanations and the realities of American penal practice. Taking actual practice as its starting point, this essay argues instead that the animating mission of the American carceral project is the exclusion and control of those people officially labeled as criminals. It maps the contours of exclusion and control, exploring how this institution operates, the ideological discourse that justifies it, and the resulting normative framework that has successfully made a set of practices that might otherwise seem both inhumane and self-defeating appear instead perennially necessary and appropriate.
       
      Appreciating the “cognitive conventions” by which current penal practices are rendered at once logical and legitimate proves to shed light on a number of mystifying features of the Americanpenal landscape, including why LWOP and supermax have proliferated so widely; why sentences are so often grossly disproportionate to the offense; why, given the multiple complex causes of crime, the state persists in responding to criminal conduct by locking up the actors; why prison conditions are so harsh; why recidivism is so high; why extremely long sentences are so frequently imposed even for relatively non-serious crimes; and even why the people we incarcerate are disproportionately African-American. Without claiming to provide comprehensive answers to these vexing questions, this essay offers a framework that helps to explain these striking aspects of the American carceral system. This framework takes as its starting point the practical demands incarceration imposes on the state itself: the exclusion and control of the people sentenced to prison. But as will be shown, in the American context, efforts to make sense of this way of responding to antisocial behavior quickly lead beyond practicalities to a moral economy on which the incarcerated lose not only their liberty but also their full moral status as fellow human beings and fellow citizens. What happens to them is thus no longer a matter for public concern. And as a consequence of this collective indifference, penal practices that may otherwise seem counterproductive, unnecessarily harsh, and even cruel become comprehensible and even inevitable.
       
      Part II of this essay sketches the structure of the American carceral system, exposing both its dependence on the logic of exclusion and control and the moral economy that drives it. Part III explores the self-defeating nature of current carceral practices—the way the combination of prison conditions and postcarceral burdens ensures that many people who have done time will return to society more prone to criminal activity than previously. Part IV considers the question of how such an evidently self-defeating system has been able to sustain itself, and locates the answer in the radically individualist ideology, pervasive in the criminal context, that construes all criminal conduct as exclusively the product of the offender’s free will. Part V illustrates the way this individualist discourse constructs criminal offenders as not just unrepentant evildoers but also sub-human—a process referred to as “making monsters”—and examines the work this normative reframing does both to vindicate the penal strategy of exclusion and control and to justify the arguably inhumane treatment of prisoners. Part VI explores the way that perceiving criminal offenders as moral monsters makes it difficult to distinguish the relatively few individuals who are genuinely congenitally violent and dangerous from the vast majority who are not; through this ideological (re)construction,allpeople who persist in committing crimes, even nonviolent offenders, can come to seem appropriate targets for extended and even permanent exclusion. Part VII considers the racial implications of exclusion and control, in particular the way the cultural construction of African Americans as “incorrigible” may explain why members of this group are overrepresented as targets of the American carceral system. Part VIII shifts the focus to the prison itself, where the self-defeating logic of exclusion and control has reappeared behind bars in the form of the supermax prison. Finally, the Conclusion considers how the destructive and self-defeating dynamic of exclusion and control may be disrupted. It argues that a political strategy emphasizing the financial costs of incarceration is bound to fail unless it also generates an ideological reorientation towards recognizing the people the state incarcerates as fellow human beings and fellow citizens, entitled to respect and consideration as such.

Self-Image and Strategic Ignorance in Moral Dilemmas
Avoiding information about adverse welfare consequences of self-interested decisions, orstrategic ignorance, is an important source of corruption, anti-social behavior and even atrocities. We model an agent who cares about self-image and has the opportunity to learn the social benefits of a personally costly action.  The trade-off between self-image concerns and material payoffs can lead the agent to use ignorance as an excuse, even if it is deliberately chosen. Two experiments, modeled after Dana, Weber, and Kuang (2007), show that a) many people will reveal relevant information about others' payoffs after making an ethical decision, but not before, and b)  some people are willing to pay for ignorance. These results corroborate the idea that Bayesian self-signaling drives people to avoid inconvenient facts in moral decisions.

Nailed Down to the Past: Nostalgia, Masculinity, and Corporeality in American Literature, 1900-1950
ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATIONNailed Down to the Past: Nostalgia, Masculinity, and Corporeality in American Literature, 1900-1950byJeffrey Craig GreenwellDoctor of Philosophy, Graduate Program in EnglishUniversity of California, Riverside, August 2011Professor Katherine Kinney, Chairperson	This dissertation will argue that, in addition to the widespread popular cultural perception of nostalgia as a saccharine, lachrymose phenomenon in which people yearn for an ostensibly kinder, gentler time, a number of early twentieth-century literary texts note how white males use nostalgia to express anxiety whenever apparent threats to their power manifest themselves as marginalized individuals' endeavoring for progress. Whereas progress looks forward and attempts to improve upon the past, nostalgia looks back, regarding the past as the ideal which must be reproduced. 	An introduction discusses the historical development and evolution of nostalgia as concept. Each of the four chapters discusses a characteristic of nostalgia as manifested in texts by Faulkner, Weldon Johnson, Cather, Fitzgerald, Dreiser, and Chesnutt. The first chapter describes depression insofar as nostalgic individuals exhibit an unhappiness with the present circumstances in which they find themselves. Such misery results from an inconsistency between the nostalgically idealized vision of the past and the disappointing present. The second chapter addresses desire, noting that nostalgic people yearn for a better past precisely because of their disappointment and frustration. Desire can never be fully satisfied, even when people obtain what they believe they want. 	The third chapter addresses destruction directed inward; individuals unable to imagine a future conforming neatly to their vision of the world as it should be--and presumably was in the past--believe they have no other choice than to commit suicide. 	When individuals blame the incoherence between the desired past and unsatisfactory present on others, they direct the destruction outward--the final chapter's focus.  In death, the memories of individuals consigned to discursive oblivion or physical death or both are preserved by those who destroy them in ways that maintain white males' advantage in power asymmetries. A conclusion considers how to apply the features of nostalgia analyzed in this dissertation to the literature published in the 1950s and 1960s.

Party effects in the House and Senate
There exists a large body of literature regarding the organization of the United States Congress and the importance of political parties in shaping legislative outcomes. Ideological scores developed in the last two decades have become increasingly popular in this debate. However I show here that the scores themselves are affected, and most likely biased, by the strength of the majority party. First, I show that the distribution of DW- NOMINATE scores for majority members is significantly different than for the minority party. In Chapter 2, I show that the probability DW-NOMINATE incorrectly predicts a majority party member's vote is significantly lower than for a minority party member's vote. I argue that this is because fewer bills dividing the majority party are likely to reach the floor than those dividing the minority party. Finally, in Chapter 3, I demonstrate one method of using DW-NOMINATE scores that accounts for the party strength bias of the scores. Using this method, I show that majority-party membership is more important for shaping legislative outcomes than is committee membership or ideological centrism

Changing Perceptions and Policy:  Redefining Indigeneity through California Chumash Revitalization
This research examines the significant rise of American Indian political power, rights claims, recognition endeavors and reaffirmation of Chumash identity through cultural revitalization projects in southern California. Increased efforts for Chumash recognition - including public visibility, federal acknowledgement, academic validation and engagement in policy process - are not without conflict, negotiation and compromise. Nor is meaningful and balanced participation and decision-making guaranteed in changing policies designed for indigenous inclusion. Central debates throughout politicized indigenous arenas involve who has the power to control, legitimate and represent Chumash history, culture and identity. Drawing on extensive ethnographic study among federally unrecognized Chumash groups who have been dramatically underrepresented in political, legal and social arenas, this research outlines the representational, material and organizational challenges they face in pressing for recognition, rights claims and balanced representation in policy. Ethnographic research methods of participant observation, interviews, and archival research were conducted in southern California where there is a large concentration of Chumash American Indian communities, academics, and government officials negotiating and contesting claims of indigenous rights and identity.  Explored were how the inherent contradictions between indigenous, legal, academic and scientific knowledge in policy arenas are negotiated and reconciled; how collaborative efforts between government officials, indigenous groups and academics might better design and implement policies to serve the diversity of indigenous circumstances and; various ways indigenous knowledge, practices and discourse are utilized for greater recognition in political, social and policy arenas. By elucidating how the struggle for recognition shifts power relations among Chumash, academics, policy makers and government officials, this project opens an understanding to the effective collaborative practices, organizational strategies, and flexible policies working to balance multiple needs, voices and goals of unrecognized American Indians.

Equity Not Equality: The Gender Discourse of an Egyptian Activist
Since its inception in 1928, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood has played a large role in shaping Egyptian politics and society. The 2011 toppling of Hosni Mubarak and the opening up of the political system has led to an increased presence of the movement, with representatives forming a majority in parliament and even winning the powerful presidency. Observers and analysts within and without Egypt continue to have questions about the movement and its motives and perspectives. Fairly or not, the question of the Brotherhood’s stance on women and questions of gender are at the forefront of the debate. Encouraged by the former regime’s propaganda against the opposition movement, as well as the group’s conservative approach, many critics fear that the brotherhood’s ascent will result in a decrease of women’s rights and political participation.
      This paper seeks to explore this question through examining the work of one of the movement’s former leaders: Zainab al-Ghazali. Al-Ghazali has bedeviled many observers, as her work within the movement seems to contradict her rhetoric on the role of women within society. While she thrived in the male-dominated sphere of political leadership, she encouraged Muslim women to return to the home and maintain the base of Islamic society: the family. An examination of al-Ghazali’s texts reveals support for women’s rights and participation, but not with the goal of achieving gender equality. Her discourse also displays a connection between conservative gender norms and the postcolonial question of indigenous sovereignty. Understanding this interplay of ideologies not only sheds light on al-Ghazali’s discourse, but also on the ideological roots of the Muslim Brotherhood.

A powerful argument for same-sex marriage lies hidden in plain sight. Embracing the notion that gay rights victories enable “homosexual lifestyle choices,” Boucai’s article proposes that same-sex marriage bans are unconstitutional under Lawrence v. Texas because they channel people, particularly bisexuals, into heterosexual relations and relationships. In addition to detailing this claim’s legal and factual bases, “Sexual Liberty and Same-Sex Marriage” refutes the supposed doctrinal imperatives that underlie bisexual erasure in gay rights litigation.

Bilingualism, Desdoblamiento, and Dissociative Identity in Juan Marsé’s El amante bilingüe
The Barcelonese author Juan Marsé has remarked of his 1990 novel, El amante bilingüe, that it is intended to represent the “schizophrenic” nature of Barcelona, referring to what Marsé views as the fundamental cultural and linguistic division of the officially bilingual city’s inhabitants into two national identities: Spanish-speaking “Castilians” and Catalan-speaking “Catalans”. The rhetoric of illness that Marsé uses to describe his novel suggests that the existence of more than one language and cultural identity in Barcelona, rather than a positive force, is actually pathological and can lead to mental illness in its inhabitants. In Marsé’s novel, the plight of the book’s protagonist, an individual who functions in both spheres of Barcelonese society while fully identifying with neither, supports the theory that bilingualism and biculturalism may lead to self-destruction. Forced to choose between his two “identities”, Marsé’s main character irreparably splits himself into two irreconcilable psychological entities: the Catalan Juan/Joan Marés and the Spanish Juan Faneca. Marsé’s novel thus emphasizes the dichotomic nature of Barcelonese society, in which one is forced to choose between two diametrically opposed cultural and linguistic affiliations: one is either Catalan or Castilian, and no allowance is made for an intermediate or dual identity. This paper explores the rhetorical tools Marsé uses to depict the binarism of Catalan society and the adverse effects this “split personality” can have on its inhabitants as well as examining the questions it raises about the possibilities (or lack thereof) for national identity in contemporary Barcelona.

The sources and limits of political enthusiasm
Political affect has historically been viewed as a fundamental impairment to the functioning of democracy. Indeed, democratic politics is often seen as particularly susceptible to dangerous provocation through inflamed sentiments. Yet still, a continuing worry for contemporary democracies is the problem of developing and maintaining political allegiances that encourage civic engagement without those allegiances becoming the basis for political exclusion or the infringement of human rights. My dissertation investigates democratic allegiances through the lens of political enthusiasm. I argue that political enthusiasm - the feeling, as Kant puts it, that accompanies "the idea of the good," commingling inspiration and conviction - is a necessary feature in the functioning of salutary allegiances to an open political system. Due to its historical association with religious and political fanaticism, enthusiasm remains a relatively unexplored analytic concept within democratic theory. Many view the use of political emotions generally - and enthusiasm in particular - as perilous to democracy, preferring instead to encourage the rationalization of interests because of its predictability. Such concern for emotions that motivate political closure seems salient, especially in the context of new and developing democracies, where allegiance formations have proved vulnerable to hyper-nationalism. But, as my dissertation shows, not all political emotions need motivate closure. I elaborate an analytic and behavioral distinction between enthusiasm (which, I argue, leads to open allegiances) and fanaticism (which results in closure). I illustrate this distinction through a reappraisal of historical developments in late 18th century German thought, where enthusiasm is discussed alternatively as Schwärmerei and Enthusiasmus. Through analysis of the works of diverse German thinkers - from Wieland and Kant, to the "popular philosophy" movement (including Mendelssohn, Gentz, and Garve), and romantics such as Fichte and Novalis, amongst others - I present a developing portrait of this dual conceptualization of enthusiasm. My analysis discloses these historical efforts to disentangle enthusiasm from fanaticism, ultimately illustrating how contemporary failure to distinguish between the two leaves a void in understating affective motivations in democratic politics. I use the concept of enthusiasm to develop a new framework by which to evaluate successful patterns of democratic allegiances

From elevated freeways to surface boulevards: neighborhood and housing price impacts in San Francisco
Freeway “deconstruction” marks an abrupt shift in urban policy. Priorities are shifting away from designing cities to enhance mobility toward promoting livability. This paper investigates the neighborhood, traffic, and housing price impacts of replacing elevated freeways with surface boulevards in two corridors of San Francisco in California, USA: Embarcadero along the city’s eastern waterfront and Central Freeway/Octavia Boulevard serving a predominantly residential neighborhood west of downtown. Using informant interviews, literature reviews, and statistical analyses, the research suggests that freeway conversions generally gentrifies neighborhoods, although policies like affordable housing mandates can temper displacement effects. Empirical evidence on residential sales transactions reveals that the disamenity effects of proximity to a freeway have for the most part given way to amenity benefits once roadways are converted to landscaped multiway boulevards. It is concluded that freeway-to-boulevard conversions have yielded net positive benefits without seriously sacrificing transportation performance.

Psychological mechanisms of gender differences in social support use under stress
Social support has been shown to confer health benefits by buffering stress, yet men use support much less than women. It is not known, however, which barriers prevent support use in men, and whether they apply only to seeking help or receiving help in general. The purpose of this dissertation is to explore support seeking, accepting, and effectiveness for men and women, and how gender differences in perceived costs and benefits of support govern these processes. Using an online survey, participants in Study 1a rated the stressfulness and available resources associated with hypothetical stressors when imagining facing them alone or with a friend. Participants perceived more resources available when imagining friends being present, yet for male subjects this was especially true when the friend was female. This gender pattern was more pronounced in Study 1b, which inquired about helpfulness rather than availability of resources. Study 2a investigated actual help seeking behavior during a laboratory stressor and showed that men asked for help more from women than from men, while females requested help equally across genders. Participants in Study 2b were given a survey describing the stressor in Study 2a and estimated costs and benefits of asking for help. While there was no difference in perceived costs, such as embarrassment, men believed that other men would be less likely to give them requested assistance. The gender pattern in support use changed in Study 3, which assessed participants' rates of accepting freely offered help during a laboratory stressor. Females again accepted help equally across supporter genders, while men accepted help equally in one case and more from men in another. Finally, Study 4 examined how gender and social support influenced cardiovascular recovery following an emotional stressor. For both genders, emotional support facilitated greatest recovery, especially when it came from a same-gender source. Overall these studies found little evidence for gender differences in costs or effectiveness of support use, and emphasized gender differences in support seeking based on perceived availability. Overcoming these barriers in support seeking could have important implications for men's health and wellbeing

The female body is one of the most heavily culturally coded signifiers both historically and in visual cultures around the world. At a time when visual media technologies are increasingly becoming integral to our daily lives, and emergent art and visual technology forms such as screendance circulate along global pathways with other media objects, to what extent can screendance resist, or even transform, the pervasive commercial representations of, and messages about, the female body? Drawing from feminist film theory, media theory, semiotics, existential phenomenology and cultural studies, this study comparatively analyzes representations of female identity in selected screendances side by side with advertising, commercial Hollywood films and network news media. I begin by deconstructing corporeal images to discover what it is about an image that makes it provocative in relation to representing female identity. Then I examine different ways in which the female body is utilized in imagery that hails and shapes the viewer. Given that screendance circulates globally, I also look closely at three transnational screendances that represent the veiled female body and demonstrate that culturally coded icons such as the veil resist abstraction when appropriated in representations by artists from another culture. I demonstrate that given the nature of the medium, when screendance represents the female body it inherits culturally constructed meanings along with mainstream media conventions, and, indeed, some screendances repeat reductive representations prescribed by dominant patriarchal consumer ideology. Conversely, some screendance artists challenge, disturb or subvert those meanings despite the conventions of the medium. Key to their transgressions, I argue, are two factors. One is that some screendance artists represent the female body moving with intention and embodying what Merleau-Ponty calls the "lived body." Another factor is that they all incorporate some form of visual and/or conceptual ambiguity in ways that operate productively in the representation of female identity such as challenging exclusionary stereotypes. This dissertation spotlights those artists and seeks to give momentum to the ways in which they promote alternative bodily identities and challenge the status quo

A Property Rights Framework for Transit Services
The paper shows how variations in systems of property rights explain diverse experiences of urban jitneys and buses. Scheduled bus service entails route specific investments and cultivation of a market. If these investments can be expropriated by interloping jitneys, scheduled service will be dissolved. Property rights in curbspace determine whether scheduled service will be preserved, and whether jitney services will co-exist. We analyze the dynamics of thick and thin transit markets, with and without curb rights. We develop a governance system of curb rights that would let bus operators appropriate their own investments in scheduled service, yet would avoid monopoly by letting jitneys and competing scheduled services operate along the same route. A property rights system dispenses with government ownership, franchise contracting, and regulation.

Thinking and Feeling with "Trans Affect"
This dissertation articulates the ways that thinking and feeling with "trans affect" promises better understandings of experiences of trans embodiment. First examining key intellectual debates in feminist, queer, and trans theories about the inheritances and formations of "transgender" and trans, the dissertation explores ties between these conversations and discussions in feminist science studies about knowledge politics. Arguing that attention to "affect," or feeling as bodily movement and emotion, promises better ways to get at the lived experiences of trans people, the dissertation focuses on the role of specifically "trans affect" as a means to understand the kinds of transformations and emergent knowledges that trans experiences promise. Close readings of the role of "trans affect" in work by Aleshia Brevard, Leslie Feinberg, and Susan Stryker reveal the ways that "trans affect" can prompt transformations in not just methods of reading and understanding, but also in the knower who seeks its touch. The writing concludes by articulating how the mode of attention that inheres in "thinking and feeling with trans affect" can and should be brought into other projects in ontology and epistemology.

A time for resistance : globalization, undocumented immigration, and the Chicana /o movement in the San Diego borderlands
This dissertation asks how the ethnic Mexican community in Southern California struggled for full societal membership while a large proportion of their constituency were noncitizens and therefore targets of border enforcement policies? These violations, due to racialist presumptions of border enforcement, not only affected immigrants, but also U.S. citizens of Mexican heritage. I demonstrate that beginning in the 1920s and continuing to the present, with particular highlight on the "Chicano movement" of the 1960s and 70s, a number of activists responded to this conundrum by forging a conception of community across differences in nationality (American and Mexican) and citizenship status (U.S. citizens and Mexican immigrants). This more fluid, transnational conception of a "Chicano- Mexicano" community was chiefly developed through the spectrum of a shared ethnicity and culture coupled with the experience of racialization by border enforcement immigration policies. Transnational and cross-citizenship solidarity within the ethnic Mexican community was forged in the context of struggle against more narrowly nationalistic forces both within and outside the community. In recognition of this vexing context, my dissertation explores the activism emanating from the Committee on Chicano Rights (CCR) led by Herman Baca, a printer from the barrios of southeast San Diego County. Building off the cross-citizenship activism of Mexican- American labor activists of the previous generation, the CCR utilized a grassroots approach to mobilizing by basing itself in and interacting with working-class Latina/o community members to assess key social problems and develop solutions to them. Mobilizing as a united ethno- racial community in classic Chicano movement style, the CCR moved into addressing class issues through engagement with the capital-labor antagonism embedded within immigration policy. This community-based effort engaged constituents initially through voter registration and later through providing community services to undocumented migrants, going door-to-door calling issues-based meetings in communal places such as the local church, and establishing an open presence out of Baca's printing shop in the main commercial strip of the city. In this way, the CCR stayed attuned to the demographic transformations occurring in the Latina/o community in the 1970s, namely the mass influx of new migrant laborers, many of whom were undocumented

Sexuality as a guise : the impossibility of queering the New Jersey 4/7 and the politics of representation for black women
Although scholars emphasize the transformative aspects of liberal and Civil Rights ideology as a remedy to past injustices, more consideration must be given to the history of identities that shape self-authorization for black women. This thesis is an intertexual analysis of the New York v. Brown, Dandridge, Hill, Johnson (N.Y. App. Div. 2007) criminal court case. Newspapers, cable news shows, and court transcripts illustrate how the focus concentrated on the women's performance of a supposed female masculinity, rather than the possibility of homophobic violence. This characterization of the women must be placed within the context of the racialization of gender and sexuality in the antebellum American south and moments that proceed. Injury to black women's bodies, in the form of rape, murder, forced removal, were not viewed as crimes because of their legal and moral standing as non -humans and property-plus. Reconstruction up to the early 1990s conveniently used representations of the black community as scapegoats and distractions of U.S. economic failures. Interestingly, the representation of the women involved in New York v Brown vilified them in the media as inherently violent not only because of their blackness, but the performance of gender. Though there has been recent legislation on hate crimes to prevent violence and the realistic possibility on the institutionalization of gay/lesbian marriage, the continued violence against black queer youth remains unchallenged and invisible. While the prison and military industrial complexes have become containers for poor and racialized bodies, critiques against rights-based redress and the creation of spaces for alternative representations offer possibilities

Travel Patterns and Welfare to Work
The nation is about to enter into the second stage of welfare reform with its federal reauthorization within the upcoming year. The first stage of welfare reform started with the enactment of the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), which transformed welfare from an income entitlement program to a transition-to-work program. As the federal and state governments reauthorize welfare reform with the goal of refining existing policies and programs to enhance the ability of welfare recipients to find and hold employment, it is worthwhile to examine what we have learned about the travel patterns of welfare-to-work participants during the initial phase of welfare to work. The shift to a jobs-first approach has made transportation barriers a top priority (Blumenberg and Ong, 2001). Our recent research demonstrates that employment and earnings are tied to access to private and public transportation (Ong, 2001; Ong et al., 2001; Ong and Houston, forthcoming). Here, we examine another dimension of the nexus between welfare reform and transportation: the impact on travel patterns.

Mongrel Forms: Tragedy, Comedy, and Mixed Genres in Britain, 1680-1760
This dissertation analyzes the unlicensed mixtures of tragedy and comedy that appeared in the playhouses, periodicals, and novels of the eighteenth century. Scholars have argued that in the Restoration's coterie theaters, the tragicomic dialectic functioned as a heuristic device for debates about political theory. "Mongrel forms" extends this premise, contending that by the turn into the eighteenth century, the tidiness of bipartite tragicomedy had been replaced by powerful ideas about generic contagion and corruption. For an increasingly bourgeois audience, tragicomic monsters and mongrels, widely derided by literary and dramatic critics, became associated less with debates about kingship and more closely aligned with a discourse on the perils and pleasures of different kinds of social mixing. As dramatic genres were mediated by live, feeling bodies, the "mongrelization" of tragedy and comedy created sites of contact in which social categories, such as race, class, gender and sexuality, could be contested or confirmed. The social re-organization intimated by mixed genres could be attacked as aesthetically monstrous. The blended form was also deployed to make visible identities and experiences not otherwise legible.The five chapters of the dissertation include a number of case studies in which mongrelizing tragedy and comedy creates a vital space in which players, writers, spectators, and critics imagine possibilities of change to aspects of English civil society. The first chapter begins with neoclassical critic Thomas Rymer's infamous 1693 treatise on <italic>Othello'</italic>s comic flaws, an essay in which a critique of a corrupted tragedy becomes inseparable from fears about interracial desire. Colley Cibber's critically neglected writing for the tragic stage comprises the dissertation's second chapter. The third chapter assesses Nahum Tate's notorious adaptation of Shakespeare's <italic>King Lear</italic> in light of the changing sexual politics of the London stage. The fourth chapter analyzes the tragicomic structure of Charlotte Lennox's <italic>The Female Quixote</italic> (1752), a novel in which generic friction signals the obstacles faced both by Lennox's titular heroine and professional female authors at midcentury. The dissertation closes with a study of Sir Joshua Reynolds' <italic>Garrick between Tragedy and Comedy</italic> (1761), an allegorical canvas that assuages contemporary worries about actors' sexuality and rank.

Social Climbing: A Contextual Approach to Understanding the Effects of Social Hierarchy on Individual Cognition and Behavior
Power and status hierarchies are ubiquitous in human society.  Although a significant amount of evidence suggests that people seek power and status, there is a general emphasis in the extant literature on hierarchy acceptance and reinforcement.  This dissertation examines the actions people take to challenge and modify the hierarchies of which they are a part, particularly in response to structural characteristics of those hierarchies.  Chapter 1 introduces the central concepts investigated in the dissertation.  Chapter 2 examines the effects of status hierarchy dispersion and legitimacy on group members' behaviors.  Two studies indicate that hierarchy dispersion increases individuals' motivation to attain high status, particularly in hierarchies perceived to be illegitimate, leading to status challenges, which are detrimental for group performance.  Chapter 3 investigates the interaction of power and legitimacy on the tendency to conform to social norms.  Whereas legitimate power decreases conformity to norms, illegitimate power increases conformity, compared to being powerless.  Chapter 4 examines how people value power and status distinctly.  There is a general tendency for people to place greater importance on status, defined as the respect they receive from others, compared to power, the control they have over valuable resources.  This is moderated by gender, with men tending to value power more than women, and women valuing status more than men.  Furthermore, whereas legitimacy does not change the value of having power, legitimate status is significantly more valuable than illegitimate status.  Chapter 5 captures common themes across the projects, identifies implications for researchers and organizations, and highlights additional questions that should be addressed in future research.

Essays on migration and monetary policy
The dissertation is comprised of three chapters, each a free-standing paper. The first chapter estimates the inflow of undocumented migrants to the United States. I find that the estimates are consistent with the previous estimates in the literature and the methodology provides a longer time series of undocumented migrants inflows than currently exists in the literature. The inflows of undocumented migrants are correlated with the business cycle in both the United States and Mexico. The second chapter models the decision to migrate over different costs structures and finds that both the lower- and upper- income shifted inward as a result of the increased smuggling fees over the previous 15 years. The model is estimated in low-cost and high-cost periods of migration to determine whether the decision to migrant has changed for different income groups. The third chapter estimates the market-perceived monetary policy rule by using macroeconomic announcements to forecast changes in market expectations. We find evidence that between 1994 and 2007 the market-perceived Federal Reserve policy rule changed: the inflation response became more hawkish, and the output response vanished

When Blood Won't Tell: An Intra-Categorical Intersectional Framework for Understanding the Construction of Race
This thesis employs the theory of intersectionality to broaden our understanding of the social construction of race.  To do so, the thesis explicates a 1806 Virginia Supreme Court decision, Hudgins v. Wright, to illustrate how race is intersectionally constituted.  I employ the term  "intra-categorical intersectionality" to describe this dynamic. By intra-categorical intersectionality I mean to the process by which a number of factors intersect to construct race.  First, the thesis discusses both Crenshaw's 1989 article on the theory of intersectionality, and Ian F. Haney Lopez's 1994 article on the Social Construction of Race in its Theoretical Framework section.  The thesis then provides some background on Virginia during the early eighteenth and nineteenth century as a predicate to explicating Hudgins v Wrights to reveal how the court's opinion reflects an intra-categorical intersectional approach.  In the context of doing so, the thesis demonstrates  how skin-color, hair texture, performance,  family lineage, white witnesses testimony, reputation, judges' personal views on slavery, and gender intersect  to determine race.

Spatial Effects upon Employment Outcomes: The Case of New Jersey Teenagers
Theories about the importance of space in urban labor markets have emphasized the role of employment access, on the one hand, and neighborhood composition, on the other hand, in affecting employment outcomes. This paper presents an empirical analysis which considers both of these factors, together with individual human capital characteristics and household attributes in affecting youth employment.
      The analysis is based upon an unusually rich sample of micro data on youth in four New Jersey metropolitan areas. The empirical analysis is based on a sample of some 28,000 at home youth, matched to detailed census tract demographic information and specially constructed measures of employment access.
      The research includes a comparison of the importance of neighborhood and access in affecting youth employment when individual and household attributes are also measured. The results demonstrate the overall importance of these spatial factors (particularly neighborhood composition) in affecting youth employment in urban areas.

Beyond Density: Measuring Neighborhood Form in New England's Upper Connecticut River Valley
Research evaluating the impacts of smart growth, new urbanism, and pedestrian oriented design on transportation, public health and community life is limited by weaknesses of conventional urban form measures. A review of recent literature finds standard measures, such as development density and land use, do not sufficiently differentiate basic elements of neighborhood form. This contributes to ambiguous research findings. Improved methods for operationalizing urban form as an independent variable is a critical need for the emerging field of urban design.
      This dissertation explores the potential of developing simple, replicable measures that can better distinguish first order differences between neighborhoods. The complex nature of three dimensional space and a lack of useable datasets at this scale suggested an exploratory, hypothesis generating, research approach. The project is built around detailed study of a dozen neighborhoods in the Upper Valley Region of Vermont and New Hampshire. An extensive field based analysis of urban form identified key urban form variables and speculated on associations with perceived qualities of the neighborhood environment. Based on those findings, a GIS based, parcel-level data set was compiled at two scales of analysis neighborhood-wide and the more detailed realm of the street, block, lot, and building. The database was the basis for exploratory derivation and testing of simple replicable measures of neighborhood form. A field based survey tour established a perceptual baseline for a series of environmental qualities across the case studies. Correlating mean survey scores with calculated values served as a basic validity test for experimental measures.
      Initial findings suggest both substantial limitations and promising areas of research related to developing quantitative measures of city form. The complexity of the built environment limited successful measures to very simple constructions based on the standard density measure of units per acre such as parcels per acre, buildings per parcel, or simple ratios such as building height to setback. Correlations of measured and perceived values offered insights into the relationship between urban form and environmental qualities. For qualities such as density, connectivity, and enclosure, the associated physical dimensions were generally clear and relatively easy to measure. Physical relationships associated with other qualities such as grain, scale, consistency and permeability, are more complex but certain classes of measures seemed to capture much of the observed variation between cases. Others, such as variability, are so complex that they seem best approached, at least initially, through use of proxy measures. Opportunities for future research include testing measures across a broader context of urban form and density and operationalizing measurement protocols within a GIS framework.

Fifty Years of Grassroots Social Activism: Volume 1 Early Years
Florence Wyckoff's three-volume oral history documents her remarkable, lifelong work as a social activist, during which she has become nationally recognized as an advocate of migrant families and children. From the depression years through the 1970s, she pursued grassroots, democratic, community-building efforts in the service of improving public health standards and providing health care, education, and housing for migrant families. Major legislative milestones in her career of advocacy were the passage of the California Migrant Health Act and, in 1962, the Federal Migrant Health Act, which established family health clinics for the families who follow the crops along both the eastern and western migrant agricultural streams.
      This volume includes a discussion of Mrs. Wyckoff's childhood in Berkeley; education and development as an artist; foreign travel; the origins and early evolution of Mrs. Wyckoff's social concerns during the depression years; her activities in the Theater Union; the 1934 General Strike in San Francisco; activities in labor organizing in YWCA Industrial Department and workers' education efforts; the individuals who inspired and influenced her course as an activist in social and economic legislative activities.

States within states : how rebels rule
Rebellion is more than a military contest. Though armed confrontation is often the most visible face of rebellion, rebels also face the challenge of accessing resources to maintain their existence and finance the fight. While rebels may harness lootable resources for this purpose, such resources are not universally available, and rebels must then build support at home and/or abroad. rely on domestic civilians for support. This project models how rebels mix three governance tools to produce quasi- voluntary support: coercion, public goods provision, and ideological congruence. How rebels mix among these tools has a profound effect on the lives of the civilians they claim to represent. This project develops a theoretical explanation for how and why rebel governance varies. In the model, much depends on rebels' own ideological preferences, and on the fact that compromise can be costly for them. The governance mix rebels ultimately implement depends on the preferences of the population whose support they need, the technological and financial constraints they face, and the enabling behavior of foreign donors. I test this theory's observable implications by leveraging natural quasi-experiments in Mindanao (southern Philippines), comparing across the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), and the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), bringing to bear both qualitative and quantitative data. I also undertake longitudinal studies of the MNLF and ASG, using the cases to explore both the theory's predictions and its underlying causal mechanisms

The cult of Bwiti and the ritual re-making of space : indexicality at the cosmic zenith
People live in space-time: a space-time constructed by social relations. The social-relational base of space becomes particularly evident where cultural change has upset the environmental and kinship connections which established, and are in turn maintained, by the spatial organization which has hitherto existed. In settings of social disruption, ritual offers a site of semiotic possibility. The heightening of oppositional values at the ritual center achieves a densely layered indexicality, creating a zenith at which spatial and social structures may dialectically transform one another, and then be extended back into the lived order of the cosmos. For the Fang who experienced such disruption, living in the Equatorial Rain Forest of Northern and Central Gabon in the late 1950s, participation in the cult of Bwiti offers a counter-active means of reinvigorating the social relations that undergirded their social and spatial structures. This paper will explore the ways in which Bwiti religious activity, by creating a ritual cosmic zenith, satisfies the desire for a movement through space that has been left wanting by a general colonial malaise and the pressure of various social forces. In ritual spatio-temporal realignment of connections with the ancestors, Fang are able to re-establish the balance of social solidarity in a strongly egalitarian, and increasingly individualistic, social milieu. In doing so, they both incorporate and challenge co-existing perspectives of their lived space, and offer a provocative setting in which to consider the ways that spatial imaginings and re-imaginings may be appropriated in ritual to address social and cultural disruption

Serious Violence Victimization and Perpetration among Youth Living in the Slums of Kampala, Uganda
Introduction: Violence among youth is a major public health issue globally. Despite these concerns, youth violence surveillance and prevention research are either scarce or non-existent, particularly in developing regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa. The purpose of this study is to quantitatively determine the prevalence of violence involving weapons in a convenience sample of service-seeking youth in Kampala. Moreover, the study will seek to determine the overlap between violence victimization and perpetration among these youth and the potentially shared risk factors for these experiences.
      Methods: We conducted this study of youth in May and June of 2011 to quantify and describe high-risk behaviors and exposures in a convenience sample (N¼457) of urban youth, 14–24 years of age, living on the streets or in the slums and who were participating in a Uganda Youth Development Link drop-incenter for disadvantaged street youth. We computed bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to determine associations between psychosocial factors and violence victimization and perpetration.
      Results: The overall prevalence of reporting violence victimization involving a weapon was 36%, and violence perpetration with a weapon was 19%. In terms of the overlap between victimization and perpetration, 16.6% of youth (11.6% of boys and 24.1% of girls) reported both. In multivariate analyses, parental neglect due to alcohol use (Adj.OR¼2.28;95%CI: 1.12—4.62) and sadness (Adj.OR=4.36 ;95%CI: 1.81—10.53) were the statistically significant correlates of victimization only. Reportinghunger (Adj.OR=2.87 ;95%CI:1.30—6.33), any drunkenness (Adj.OR=2.35 ;95%CI:1.12—4.92) and any drug use (Adj.OR=3.02 ;95%CI:1.16—7.82) were significantly associated with both perpetration and victimization.
      Conclusion: The findings underscore the differential experiences associated with victimization and perpetration of violence involving weapons among these vulnerable youth. In particular, reporting hunger, drunkenness and drug use were specifically associated with victimization and perpetration. These are all modifiable risk factors that can be prevented. It is clear that these vulnerable youth are in need of additional services and guidance to ameliorate their adverse childhood experiences, current health risk behaviors and disadvantaged living context.

The Electoral Strategy of Legislative Politics: Balancing Party and Member Reputation in Japan and Taiwan
This thesis explores how political parties coordinate competing objectives, such as winning elections and influencing public policy with demands from their legislators whose interests lie principally in re-election and policy distribution. Electoral and legislative institutions affect the prioritizing of these goals and the appropriate strategy by which to achieve them. Utilizing two East Asian democracies, Japan and Taiwan, my dissertation evaluates this argument via the econometric analysis of various aspects of legislative behavior and policy outcomes, such as committee assignments and deliberations, and intergovernmental fiscal transfers. In regard to committee activities, there exists a significant difference between governing and opposition parties in terms of the expected role of their members on legislative committees. In regard to fiscal transfers, governing parties distribute fiscal resources strategically to party strongholds.

North Korean Literature: Margins of Writing Memory, Gender, and Sexuality
This dissertation examines literary works from North Korea from the 1970s and 1980s, paying particular attention to the way writers express their creativity through the discussion in memory, gender, and sex. To think that North Korean writers are conditioned to produce works that only praise Kim Il Sung and the Party may a short-sighted assessment of their literary practices and culture. Ever since the Fifteenth Plenary Meeting of the Fourth Central Committee of the Worker's Party in 1967--where Juche ideology and the monolithic policy were instituted as the guiding principles of every aspect of North Korean life--literature, film, and artworks changed to adopt the new system of celebrating Kim Il Sung, the Party, and the nation. Indeed, the writing tradition and culture changed for the members of the Writer's Union. What was known as propagandist literature became even more tightly controlled under the new decree of the monolithic policy. This monolithic policy gave rise to a singular voice that dominates and eliminates all other voices that may contend the Kim Il Sung regime. Writers were expected to (and in some cases ordered to) comply with the singular voice that celebrates the nation. However, even amid this radical change in North Korea, writing has the power to subvert, satirize, and disrupt the teleology of the grand narrative of the nation-state. This dissertation engages in the power of writing found in moments where the writers discuss the topics of memory, gender, and sexuality.

Preserving the Pixel Party: Archives for Born-digital Social Communities
Born-digital social communities are evolving into rich places of cultural interaction. A lack of broad awareness of these communities is leading to an unfortunate situation in which we increasingly lose the chance to document this developing area of contemporary culture, resulting in a regrettable gap in future knowledge. The archival situation is in need of change.	This study attempts to discern the contemporary situation and propose strategies for improvement. Attitudes toward archiving among professional and public communities are explored. A pervasive sense of confusion mingles with issues of privacy, preservation, and purpose among internet-savvy community members. Aided by community collaboration, potential solutions are reached. The dramatic need for dissemination of information to the public, to empower personal archiving actions and prevent loss of cultural data, is made clear. Conclusions provide material from which to extrapolate practical and beneficial archival actions in the future preservation and documentation of digital communities.

Bystander Motivation in Bullying Incidents: To Intervene or Not to Intervene?
Introduction: This research sought to extend knowledge about bystanders in bullying situations with a focus on the motivations that lead them to different responses. The 2 primary goals of this study were to investigate the reasons for children’s decisions to help or not to help a victim when witnessing bullying, and to generate a grounded theory (or conceptual framework) of bystander motivation in bullying situations.
      Methods: Thirty students ranging in age from 9 to 15 years (M=11.9; SD=1.7) from an elementary and middle school in the southeastern United States participated in this study. Open- ended, semistructured interviews were used, and sessions ranged from 30 to 45 minutes. We conducted qualitative methodology and analyses to gain an in-depth understanding of children’s perspectives and concerns when witnessing bullying.
      Results: A key finding was a conceptual framework of bystander motivation to intervene in bullying situations suggesting that deciding whether to help or not help the victim in a bullying situation depends on how bystanders define and evaluate the situation, the social context, and their own agency. Qualitative analysis revealed 5 themes related to bystander motives and included: interpretation of harm in the bullying situation, emotional reactions, social evaluating, moral evaluating, and intervention self-efficacy.
      Conclusion: Given the themes that emerged surrounding bystanders’ motives to intervene or abstain from intervening, respondents reported 3 key elements that need to be confirmed in future research and that may have implications for future work on bullying prevention. These included: first, the potential importance of clear communication to children that adults expect bystanders to intervene when witnessing bullying; second, the potential of direct education about how bystanders can interveneto increase children’s self-efficacy as defenders of those who are victims of bullying; and third, the assumption that it may be effective to encourage children’s belief that bullying is morally wrong.

The Slaveholding Crisis: The Fear of Insurrection, the Wilmot Proviso, and the Southern Turn Against American Exceptionalism
On December 20, 1860, South Carolinians voted to abandon the Union and sparked the deadliest war in American history. Led by a proslavery movement that viewed Abraham Lincoln’s place at the helm of the federal government as a real and present danger to the security of the South's system of slavery, southerners—both slaveholders and nonslaveholders—willingly risked civil war by seceding from the United States. Rather than staying within the fold of the Union and awaiting the new president’s conduct regarding slavery in the territories and in the slave states, secessionists took bold action to change their destiny. By acting on their expectations of what the new president would do instead of waiting for his actual policy initiatives, they wagered on the possibility of a different future. This dissertation contends that the southern fear of slave insurrection, which was influenced by the Haitian Revolution, and the belief that northern antislavery forces would use violent uprising to end southern slavery shaped the planter ethos over the arc of the antebellum period, affecting national politics. Furthermore, this project explains why secessionists viewed Abraham Lincoln's support of the Wilmot Proviso as a valid reason for disunion.

Development of human brain connectivity in health and disease
White matter development in the human brain undergoes a uniquely extended developmental trajectory, and the maturation of this complex network of connections is broadly relatable to real-world measures of cognitive ability. We begin this dissertation with a review of the literature on structural brain development, in order to provide a useful background layer for our discussion (Chapter 1). Next, we report a case study investigating white matter abnormalities in the context of prenatal methamphetamine exposure, and their cognitive correlates (Chapter 2). Then we describe our successfully-funded NIH grant proposal to 1) develop novel image analysis techniques for investigating white matter connectivity, and 2) apply them to the study of a) typical frontal lobe white matter maturation, b) its relation to executive functioning, and c) how these processes are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure (Chapter 3). The results of this effort are described in Chapter 4, Chapter 5, and Chapter 6. Finally, we supplement the work on our UCLA cohort with exciting results from two large, multi-site, collaborative efforts: 1) ADHD-200, an initiative to employ brain mapping findings in a machine learning environment for the diagnostic classification of individual subjects with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Chapter 7), and 2) PING (the Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics study), where we are leading an effort to provide the most comprehensive mapping to-date of typical white matter development (Chapter 8).

Home-Based Enterprises in Urban Spaces: An Obligation for Strategic Planning?
One major manifestation of rapid urbanization and underdevelopment is the re-emergence of informal sector activities. This trend includes the escalating growth of informal economic activities, among which are home-based enterprises (HBEs) in urban residential neighborhoods. This type of informal development, mostly undertaken by low-income urban residents, has defied government attempts to set standards or enforce compliance and is therefore a challenge for urban planners. There is a need to reconsider HBE activities in light of their positive contributions, which offset their negative effects on urban space. This paper draws urban planners’ attention to urban land use patterns and the alternative planning directions HBEs are prompting. It then calls for further research on how urban planners could plan and redesign the urban space with appropriate consideration of HBE operators. This paper has implications for national economies, especially in African and other developing countries.

"A Most Grievous and Insupportable Vexation": Billeting in Early Seventeenth Century England
"A Most Grievous and Insupportable Vexation":Billeting in Early Seventeenth Century EnglandOne of the great controversies in England during the 1620s was the practice of billeting soldiers by order of the royal government in private homes without the consent of the householder.  This practice caused considerable distress for the billeters and was one of the initial causes of the English dislike of Charles I and a major contributor to the political turmoil of the 1620s.   Billeting was also one of the roots of the Petition of Right, passed by Parliament and given the King's assent in 1628.  This Petition became an important part of the English constitutional system over the centuries and had echoes in the American Constitution.  The Dissertation explores the origins of the practice of billeting troops in private quarters and the resulting controversies in the changes in military practice in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and in Charles I's attempts to participate in the Thirty Years' War.  The Dissertation's principle subject is the billeting operations in England during the 1620s.  It describes the problems these operations created, together with the complaints of the local governments and people of England, caused by the royal government when it forced billeting burdens on to the localities.  The argument of the Dissertation is that the root cause of the billeting problems was the inability of the royal government to raise the money to support its war effort.  There is evidence that, as long as the royal government paid for billeting the soldiers, the localities were willing to billet the troops, but when the money ceased to come from London problems soon arose.  This failure created, in a domino like effect, other problems with and for the soldiers, which in turn became the problems most mentioned in the documents of the era.  The crimes, mutinies and riots by the soldiers are discussed, as well as the problems the soldiers encountered in securing food and lodging.  The Dissertation also discusses the closely associated controversy over the use of military law in place of the common law in the context of billeting operations, which engendered the use of military law as a practical way of protecting the people in the areas where the government billeted troops.

Transnational Zapata: From the Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional to Immigrant Marches
Drawing on the examples of the neo-Zapatista movement and the pro-immigrant marches of 2006, this article analyzes images of Emiliano Zapata, a Mexican national hero intricately tied to postrevolution nation rebuilding, as used within transnational movements that “de/territorialize” his image. At the same time that people in these movements have felt the negative effects of globalization, they have also benefited from certain recent technological developments associated with globalization, especially “technoscapes” and “mediascapes” that have launched the “local” discourse of Revolutionary nationalism across borders and onto the world stage through a variety of national and international (cyber)spaces, creating transnational heterotopias or “other spaces” for cultural and political expression that transgress national boundaries. Analyzing examples of Zapata imagery from the post-revolutionary era (1920s–1930s) against the neo-Zapatista movement of the 1990s and 2000s and the 2006 migrant protests in the United States, the paper explores the ways in which the formation of transnational “imagined communities” can destabilize traditional concepts of the nation-state.

Correlates of unprotected anal sex among men who have sex with men in Tijuana, Mexico
AbstractBackgroundAlthough men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS in Mexico, data on current risk behaviors in this population are lacking. This study investigated the prevalence and correlates of unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) in a sample of 260 MSM in Tijuana, Mexico.MethodsIn June 2010, men attending a gay pride celebration were invited to complete a sexual risk survey. Men who reported UAI with a male partner in the past year were compared with men who reported only protected anal sex during the same period.ResultsMean age of participants was 29.7; 54% had a high school diploma or less; and 43% were unemployed. In the past year, 55% had been tested for HIV, 21% reported using illicit drugs before or during sex, and 94% had sex only with men. Overall, 50% reported having UAI with another male in the past year. Factors independently associated with UAI in the past year were unemployment (AOR&#8201;=&#8201;1.87), attending adult movie theaters (AOR&#8201;=&#8201;2.21), using illicit drugs before or during sex (AOR&#8201;=&#8201;2.43), and not having a recent HIV test (AOR&#8201;=&#8201;1.85).ConclusionsInterventions to promote HIV testing and condom use among men who have sex with men may want to consider venue-specific approaches, as well as focus on drug-use issues in the context of unsafe sex.

Trucking Industry Demand for Urban Shared Use Freight Terminals
The issue of shared use urban freight facilities first received attention during the 1970's when it was observed that, while inter-urban freight movements were becoming increasingly efficient, there were significant diseconomies in the movement of freight via truck within urban areas. Early research suggested that shared urban freight facilities should be constructed so that trucking companies could consolidate smaller shipments into larger ones. In the past few years, the concept of “Urban Ports” has gained increasing attention, not just for carriers who need to load and unload freight, but to provide a place near the urban center for truckers to wait out peak traffic periods. In this paper, using recently developed survey data, we examine trucking company interest in such facilities by examining the results of an ordered probit demand model.

A retrospective study of ecosystem effects of the 1976/77 regime shift in the eastern Pacific warm pool
Physical processes in surface ocean circulation are critical in shaping pelagic communities. On spatial scales that include entire ocean basins, climate oscillations drive changes in ocean physics that in turn shape biological production. The El Nin̋o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), for example, persists for 6 to 18 months, spatially enveloping physical changes in the tropical and eastern Pacific. On the other hand, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), while having a similar spatial fingerprint, has "regimes" lasting 20 to 30 years. Changes in these regimes, or regime shifts, can happen abruptly (within a year), affecting pelagic ecosystems by altering processes regulating nutrient supply that in turn drive biological production (bottom-up forcing). With the benefit of hindsight, we now recognize that regime shifts have impacted ecosystems in the eastern Pacific, particularly in extra-tropical regions. Despite covering the largest portion of the worlds oceans, few long-term ecological data sets exists for tropical oceanic ecosystems. Thus, there is a lack knowledge as to how tropical open ocean systems react to regime shifts. In this dissertation, I retrospectively built physical and biological data sets to test hypotheses linking the 1976/ 77 Pacific Ocean regime shift to bottom-up effects of ecosystem change in a tropical and oceanic system, the eastern Pacific warm pool. I approached my research goals by analyzing three components of the eastern Pacific warm pool ecosystem during the 1960-2006 time period. First, I used historical hydrographic data from the World Ocean Database 2009 to characterize trends in thermocline depth and water column stratification in the upper 200 meters. Second, I tested hypotheses linking the 1976/77 Pacific Ocean regime shift to bottom-up control of ecosystem change in the eastern Pacific warm pool for mid-trophic- level organisms and apex predators. For the mid-trophic- level organisms I used ichthyoplankton samples collected during historical and contemporary expeditions to the eastern tropical Pacific. For the apex predators I used carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios measured from seabird feathers of a suite of ecologically and phylogenetically diverse seabird species collected in the eastern Pacific warm pool in 1960-2006 to gauge diet variability during this time period. I found evidence suggesting that multidecadal changes occurred in the thermal structure of the upper 200 meters in the eastern Pacific warm pool. Furthermore, I found evidence suggesting that organisms from two trophic levels responded differently to these environmental changes. Temoral variability in species assemblages of mid-trophic organisms, ichthyoplankton, appeared to be higher in regions of the study area where upwelling is prevalent, while assemblages from oceanic regions with less or no upwelling were stable. In contrast to variability of mid trophic-level organisms, the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope proxy for diet of apex predators, seabirds, showed little variation over time. These results are in agreement with the notion that physical forcing shapes nutrient fluctuations driving biological production and that lower trophic levels are more likely to respond to these fluctuations than long-lived apex predators. However, stable isotope proxy data and biological survey of apex predators in the northeastern Pacific have shown fluctuations coherent with ocean warming and the 1976/77 regime shift. The eastern tropical Pacific supports a unique multispecies community of apex predators comprised of around 50 resident seabird species and 30 cetacean species including several endemics and the world's largest yellowfin tuna fishery. The most recent regime shift is thought to have occurred in 1998/99. Future research should focus on more robust data sets that can further improve our knowledge of ecosystem effects of regime shifts in tropical systems

Liberty Deprived: The Social and Political Determinants of Female Incarceration Rates, 1979-2001
Rates of female incarceration rose steadily during the last two decades of the twentieth century.  The consequences of increased female incarceration are far reaching, not only affecting the women and their families during the period of incarceration, but also resulting in continued collateral consequences after their release.  While considerable attention has been paid to the role of the war on drugs as a causal of growth at the national level, there has been scant research that examined other possible causes of variation in female incarceration rates over time at the state level.  This research investigates state variation in changes in female incarceration rates between 1979 and 2001, along with changes in potentially important political, social, cultural, and economic factors.  This analysis confirms the importance of broadening the scope of variables used when attempting to theorize explanations for female incarceration.  It has also highlights the importance of the intersection of gender and race in determining female incarceration rates.  Moreover, it has points to the importance of historically sensitive research methods to provide a clearer understanding.  Finally, it shows that a combination of social, political, cultural, and economic factors determine the use of incarceration as a means of formal social control of women in the U.S.

Explaining unexpected electoral openings in authoritarian systems : a comparative analysis of parliamentary elections
Most authoritarian elections are non-competitive affairs, manipulated by state actors to guarantee seats for regime- backed candidates. However, on rare occasions, the state provides an unexpected electoral opening for the political opposition, leading to a defeat for regime-backed candidates. This dissertation traces these unexpected electoral openings to factional rivalries within the state's constitutional structure. Actors within an authoritarian state can be grouped broadly into conservative and reformist camps. Satisfied with the political status quo, conservatives oppose any meaningful steps toward political liberalization. In contrast, reformists aim to increase their share of the state by opening the political system to societal groups. The ability of reformists to change the electoral process and provide an electoral opening depends on the country's constitutional framework. The configuration of accountability relationships within the state, as well as the jurisdiction over the different parts of the electoral process, determines the leeway reformists have in steering the elections to their favor. This dissertation tests the above theory through comparative analyses of parliamentary elections in Egypt, Algeria, and Iran. The parliamentary elections are presented as qualitative stories. These stories identify relevant political agents, their preferences, and their powers, and then discuss political strategies adopted, constraints on strategies, and paths taken and paths rejected. By doing so, the narratives highlight the importance of institutional variation in determining electoral openings and outcomes in authoritarian systems

Trade unions, inequality, and democracy in the US and Mexico
Unions have been hailed as defenders of democracy and equality, and damned aspreservers of privilege and corruption. The global spread of neoliberalism has intensified this debate world-wide, but nowhere has it reached a higher pitch than in the United States and Mexico. In these two neighboring North American countries, one rich and one middle-income, economic liberals have battered unions over the last three decades, and unions have fought a largely defensive battle. This article surveys unions’ activities in recent decades to examinelinks between unions, democracy, and equality. The central argument is that it is essential to disaggregate the labor movement in order to make sense of these links. Both sides of the debatehave merit with reference to particular currents within the labor movement of each country.Moreover, even within particular currents, the relationship between unions, democracy, and equality is mixed and complex. Finally, the massive labor migration between the two countriesturns out to play a particular role in this set of linkages in the USA.The article begins with a brief review of relevant literature on the role of unions. A compressed summary of the historical background and main current trends in democracy and inequality in the two countries follows. The heart of the article treats the varied categories of unions in the two countries, and their relationships with democracy and inequality. Concluding remarks close the article.

Mutual Behavioral Adaptation of Partners in Dyads in Two SPecies of Prosimians
Thedynamics of mutual behavioural adaptation in the process of establishing social relationships in mouse lemurs (Microcebs murinus) and pygmy slow lorises (Nycticebus pygmaeus) was studied. Observations were made over a 3-hour period beginning when a male and a female were first placed together during the non breeding season. As well, the behaviour of stable pairs that had been together for more than one year was observed. Behaviour was recorded using the one/zero method with 5-sec intervals. Two stages of the development of social relationships, each with different functional values, were identified. The first stage involved mutual social investigation, the second the stabilization of the social relationship. Differences in the dynamics of social contacts between species members were due to their different social structures. The process of social adaptation of behaviour in dyads is discussed and quantitative and qualitative characteristics of breeding pairs and non breeding pairs are compared. It is suggested that a convenie nt strategy for improving breeding is to replace one of the partners with an experienced animal.

The Psychological Basis of Quality Decision Making
Effective strategic management requires analysis, decisions and actions by an organization to create and sustain competitive advantage. Gooddecisions are obviously desirable but whether the decision is good is a judgment call, often after the fact, and is itself subject to bias. What is less subject to debate is the process that leads to accuracy or quality decision making. This requires not just access to available information but proper processing, interpretation and integration of that data. Critical is the consideration of multiple options and perspectives at all stages and there are a myriad of reasons why people do not do that. Defective decisions come from poor information search, selective bias in processing the information, a lack of considering alternatives, a failure to examine the risks of the preferred choice and a rush to judgment (Janis and Mann 1977). In short, the selection, interpretation and integration of information is “biased”.
       In this brief overview, we consider “bias” both at the individual and the group level. The overarching perspective is that there are psychological reasons that constrain and bias thought and there are also psychological antidotes that can improve it.  The former are more numerous and well documented than the latter but in both individual and group decision making, the influences are predictable, pervasive and profound, leading at times to defective decision making and at other times to better and even creative decision making.

A Case Study of the Effects of Participation in an Organization in the Lives of Women: Post-Conflict Ayacucho, Peru
This paper examines the effects of participation and the importance of organizational ties in the lives of Andean women in Ayacucho, Peru. For over two decades (1980-2000) the country of Peru went through an internal conflict that entailed serious crimes mostly committed by the Shining Path and the Peruvian Army. Ayacucho was the most affected region during the conflict, leaving poverty and dramatic consequences throughout the region. Today, the economic development of Ayacucho is slow yet a number of grass roots of organizations have allowed different segments of the population to improve their quality of life. This paper focuses on the women members of the National Association of the Relatives and Disappeared of Peru (ANFASEP), paying special attention to the importance of the organizational ties that have emerged within the organization and the reproduction of social capital. Using the data collected through forty-eight in-depth interviews, I claim that the more women participate in the organization, the better their quality of life and economic well-being is. My findings suggest that organizations have allowed them to access resources that affect their quality of life in a positive manner as long as the members of an organization remain active. In this way, organizations have become access routes for active members to resources that are otherwise hard to access. This paper makes an important contribution to the literature on women’s movements in Latin America, using Peru as a case study, offering key insights about the evolution of women’s movements into institutionalized organizations.

The Cultural Defense in Intimate Violence Against Women:  Criticizing Liberalism from a Mixed Approach
In the last decades, many Western countries have recognized minority groups’ traditions and self-determination as a part of the Human Rights ideal they are committed to enact. For a time in the U.S., the argument that culture should be always respected, on the grounds of the freedom of association and conscience, held sway. As a result, U.S. courts accepted cultural arguments that justified violent conduct against women and family members as a defense even in cases of murder, reframing them as voluntary manslaughter, in light of the perpetrator’s culture. Reacting to the excesses of this multicultural approach, liberals proposed to reject any cultural argument that condones women’s rights violation. Their reactions echoed Rawls’ philosophical position according to what arguments not based in reason or not formulated in reasonable-secular terms should not be accepted in the public discussion. Courts, then, began to reject cultural arguments in murder cases. Consequently, a third argument has become popular, favoring a mixture between multicultural and liberal approaches. The author proposes that this alternative is better. For analyzing it, the paper focuses on the situations of non-physical or less grave physical violence, as well as submission to the group’s decisions (such as in clothing and priesthood) and polygamy. She asserts that these borderline cases present a challenge in the balance between the acceptance of multiculturalism and the rejection of violence, and then a better arena where to trace a line. The reasons the author has for supporting the mixed view include a criticism of it, mainly because mixed approaches usually tend to lean more toward liberal positions. First, unmixed approached do not take care sufficiently of women’s interests. In particular, if we accept Rawlsian rules we should also exclude feminist arguments not expressed under secular terms or linear reasoning, contradicting feminists who argue that reason is no the only human decision-making capacity. Second, liberal positions tend to confuse the treatment of equality and life integrity, no taking then sufficiently into account the dynamics of violence and focusing too much on consent under liberal terms. That is linear reasoning, which provokes a tendency to overestimate culture as exclusionary of choice, and not to see that the mainstream society is also cultural. This actually reveals that liberal society has biases against minority groups and a non well-developed engagement with women’s rights. Finally, because of psychological aspects of decision-making, Western societies should allow liberal (secular and reason based) and illiberal (religious and non-reason based) arguments to have a conversation. If we do so, both sides will see better what the opposite and their own side really believes, and they may realize that their values might be closer than they think. This will enhance a bigger commitment of all citizens to women’s rights, including the right to belong to a minority group and the right to be free from violence.

Government transparency is understood to be a bedrock principle of American democracy, yet the judiciary branch is often exempted from this ideal. Secrecy exists in all branches of government, but in the judiciary it's often viewed as essential for proper ethics rather than as a threat to them. The judiciary has some important transparency traditions such as published opinions and open trials. However, the judiciary has held back from many modern transparency practices. This dissertation explores how the federal judiciary has been partially exempted from the modern expectation of transparency. The current understanding is that more information is always better for democracy, but the ambivalent relationship between this formulation and the judiciary suggests the story is more complicated. Katrina Hoch addresses this puzzle by looking at the history of government transparency, both as a concept and as a set of policies and practices, and by analyzing three judicial realms: Supreme Court confirmation battles, the debate over cameras in the courtroom, and the Supreme Court Justices' public image. This research includes hearing transcripts, case law, legislation, news reports, historical records from the American Bar Association and the Judicial Conference, field visits to the Supreme Court and Supreme Court press office, popular books about the Court, entertainment media and secondary sources. While government transparency and the federal judiciary were always structured around different principles, contemporary transparency practices have sharpened the tension between them. New developments in journalism, media economics, technology, political culture and political institutions have reshaped the meaning and practice of transparency, and the resulting new forms include the "personalization of politics" and the "performance of transparency." The judiciary has been resistant to these changes because courts operate differently from other government institutions and judges have a unique role. However, several recent developments have contributed to the personalization of the judiciary. This personalization is linked to a new mode of legitimation, one based on engagement with the public. This shift has characterized the way all public officials seek legitimation, but it is a much bigger change for the judiciary, because judges have traditionally cultivated distance rather than familiarity

The Role of the State in Transnational Health Care:  Exploring Expansion of El Salvador's Social Security Institute to Include Migrant Families
This thesis considers the possibility of expanding the Salvadoran Social Security Institute (ISSS) to permit enrollment of migrant families. The current ISSS administration is interested in allowing migrants to pay into the social security system to obtain health care benefits for themselves and their family members. No study has ever measured interest in such services among migrants in the U.S.  After reviewing existing transnational insurance initiatives and exploring health care access and remittance-sending tendencies among migrants in the U.S., I conducted original research to measure the willingness of 100 Salvadoran migrants to pay into ISSS. Nearly two-thirds (64 percent) said they were willing to pay at least $30 per month for ISSS coverage. Amount of money remitted and self-rated health were the strongest predictors of willingness to pay. The results of this research were submitted to the ISSS administration in a separate report.

Ensuring Compliance and Accountability Will Make Schools Safer for LGBT Youth
Nearly one-third of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth report a past suicide attempt. Such a large percentage can be attributed in part to school environments where they may fear physical and verbal abuse from fellow students, teachers, and administrators and may grapple with feelings of marginalization.

Evolution and Origins of  Polyploid Sonchus (Subgenus Sonchus) and  the Woody Sonchus Alliance
The Sonchinae is the most widely distributed subtribe in the tribe Cichorieae, with a discontinuous, almost cosmopolitan, and very peculiar phytogeographic distribution. In particular, genus Sonchus subgenus Sonchus, appears to be responsible for the origin of several island endemics both in the Pacific Ocean (Dendroseris, Thamnoseris, Actites, Kirkianella and Embergeria ) and the Atlantic Ocean (woody Sonchus alliance in the Macaronesian Islands). So polyploidy Sonchus and their relative Pacific polyploidy endemics are an ideal system to study the polyplodization for  the island plants. Several hypotheses have been proposed based on the morphology and karyology. We use the cloning technique to retrieve the different ITS repeat types in order to test the origin of several polyploidy Sonchus as well as polyploidy in the related Pacific islands. The Pacific endemics (Dendroseris, Embergeria, Kirkianella, and Actites) are all formed the monophyletic clade with all the their repeat types which support the single origin of these endemics. S. arvensis has been identified as a potential allopolyploid. The Stebbins hypothesis of allpolyploid origin for S. oleraceus is partially supported with confirmation of S. asper as one donor. The data also indicate a hybrid origin for S. hydrophilus which might have subsequently homogenized with ITS copies from the hybrid ancestor via concerned evolution.The woody Sonchus alliance is one of the largest Macaronesia diverse endemic groups with 6 genera and approximately 31 species. Determining accurate phylogenetic relationships among the members of the woody Sonchus alliance presents challenges because of insufficient level of molecular variation and the convergent evolution of similar morphological traits in island settings.  All taxa of  woody Sonchus alliance were sampled to investigate the phylogenetic relationships as well as to test the potential role of hybridization and introgression using three independent low-copy nuclear genes: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3pdh) , B12 and calmodulin (Cam) .  B12 and CAM phylogeny is not well resolved due to the limited informative sites. The G3PDH data set was not significantly different from that of B12 and CAM,and subsequent combined analysis provided a better resolved and supported phylogeny within the alliance. In the MP combined tree, the basal lineages of monotypic genera were not identified. The all Taeckholmia species except T. arborea formed a well-support clade. It partly supports Boulos' classification to treat Taeckholmia as a genus. But the Dendrosonchus is highly polyphyletic which does not support either Boulos' or Aldridge's classification of tree Dendrosonchus. Assessment of the role of hybridization and introgression was limited due to low sequence variability of  B12 and CAM genes, however,  potential hybridization has been  recognized comparing independent gene regions. The members of woody Sonchus alliance display extensive morphological, ecological, and anatomical diversity, but all taxa have a uniform chromosome number. Furthermore, all the members have no crossing barriers, there are extensive opportunities for hybridization between these species. We include two independent low-copy nuclear genes: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) and Calmodulin (CAM) with the cloning with several key species to test the possible homoploid hybrid speciation. There is no evidence in our data to support a hybrid origin for the monotypic species (Babcockia platylepis, Sventenia bupleuroides and Lactucosonchus webbii). The hybridization between Dendrosonchus and Taeckholmia is not supported in our data. S. tuberifer might have hybrid origin between herbaceous and small woody species.

Ethnic identity, political identity and ethnic conflict: simulating the effect of congruence between the two identities on ethnic violence and conflict
This thesis outlines and presents an alternative hypothetical process to the emergence of ethnic conflict. Ethnic conflicts, rather than being dependent upon pre-existing ‘ancient hatreds’, are instead the result of a congruence between ethnic and political identity which grants individuals the ability to use ethnicity to identify and eliminate political threats. This hypothesis is formed by the examination of three case studies of ethnic conflict: Lebanon, Northern Ireland and Croatia. This hypothesis is then formalised and tested using an agent based simulation in which agent interactions are dependent upon ethnic and political identity and the congruence between the two. As predicted there was a strong positive correlation between how accurately ethnic identity reflected political identity and the level of ethnically motivated violence in the simulation, although the relationship was not linear. Furthermore the effect of a shift in congruence was found to be roughly comparable to the effect of initialising agents with a moderate level of pre-existing ethnic antagonism.

Gendering Intimate Partner Violence: an Analysis of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
Scholars have long posited that intimate partner violence (IPV) - physical violence, sexual violence, verbal abuse, and controlling behaviors between intimate partners - is impacted by masculinity norms of aggression and dominance (for example, see Haraway and O'Neil 1999; Moore and Stuart 2005).  Despite this topic's immense potential for prevention and treatment policies, quantitative IPV research tends to eschew empirically informed measures of masculinities and femininities in favor of a simplistically binary male-female variable, likely in part because of methodological concerns over how to adequately measure the complexities of gender.  This is unfortunate given that the representative nature of large-scale, quantitatively-analyzed research is of great value to policymakers.  The present dissertation provides a thorough background on the gender and IPV literatures with a particular focus on the history and benefits of quantifying gender.  Additionally, the Bem Sex-Role Inventory, the most widely used measure of gendered psychological traits in the literature, is used to predict IPV in an analysis of 4,027 nationally-representative adolescents in a relationship, data drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.  This represents the first study using a gender trait measure to predict IPV utilizing a nationally-representative sample.  Findings from negative binomial regression and multinomial logistic regression analyses reveal that a lack of femininity - rather than simply the presence of masculinity - predicts an increased risk of IPV perpetration and victimization for both men and women.  Methodological and policy implications as well as future directions are discussed.

Preliminary Evaluation of the Coastal Transportation Corridor Ordinance in Los Angeles
The Coastal Transportation Corridor Ordinance attempts to regulate traffic congestion in a busy Los Angeles community by requiring new real estate developments to mitigate their trips and to contribute to a trust fund to be used to improve traffic flow within the affected area. In order to conduct a preliminary evaluation of the trip reduction portion of the ordinance, a sample of eight buildings housing 117 firms was selected. Three buildings housing 44 firms were subject to the ordinance, and a control group of five buildings housing 73 firms were not affected by the ordinance. Differences in ridesharing facilities, services, and subsidies were observed, and 1,216 workers in the two groups of buildings were surveyed to determine their travel patterns.
      The results show that developers affected by the ordinance are significantly more likely to include preferential parking for carpoolers in their projects, and to include some bicycle parking facilities as well. The buildings affected by the ordinance offer a substantially smaller proportion of their employees free parking at work and, among those who pay to park, those in the buildings covered by the ordinance pay higher rates. The provision of these facilities, and the combination of parking fees and other promotional efforts, have had a very small initial effect on workers' decisions to drive to work alone. The proportion of workers driving to work alone is similar in the experimental and control groups. Though twice as many workers in buildings affected by the ordinance reported carpooling to work, they were a small fraction of the workforce. A sizable proportion of workers in the study area generally depart from work outside the peak period, probably in order to avoid late afternoon congestion.

Cultural kinship as a computational system: from bottom-up to top-down forms of social organization
A key change in the evolution of our species from a common ancestor with the chimpanzees was the shift to a field of social interaction no longer dependent upon face-to-face interaction for the maintenance of social coherency.  Our hunter-gatherers ancestors made a radical shift to social relations based on a culturally constructed system of kinship relations.  Unlike biological kinship that reflects the facts of biological reproduction, cultural kinship is a constructed, computational system that enables symbolic computation of kinship relations that are expressed through the kin terms of a kinship terminology.  The system of kin terms is analogous to arithmetic as a computational system for computing quantities with symbols instantiated by the counting numbers.  The internal logic of a kinship terminology ensures consistency both in kinship relation computations and translation of kin term computations to the perspective of each person who culturally shares the same kinship terminology.  The constraint of internal and external consistency does not lead to a single kinship terminology computational system, hence there are a variety of kinship terminology systems across human societies.  In this paper I outline a theory for the generative structure of kinship terminology systems and briefly discuss the implications this for explaining structural differences between kinship terminologies and how structure relates to social organization.

Alyssa Gibbs is married to Master Sergeant Jack Gibbs, a communications specialist at the Presidio of San Francisco, when the novel opens. One morning a few hours before dawn in 1994, Alyssa contemplates leaving Jack when her estranged brother, Staff Sergeant Max Eaves, appears outside their base housing. Alyssa experiences a severe physical event: she physically splits into two separate women, each having equal consciousness and power, but with two completely different perspectives and desires.      Alyssa stays in bed while the Other Woman (as Alyssa identifies her double) observes her brother kissing her husband, opening up a deeply buried secret between the three of them. The aftermath of this finds each character taking drastic measures. Though Alyssa's split is temporary, it occurs with more frequency as Alyssa discovers her loyalty and love are caught between her husband and her brother, forcing her to make an impossible choice.

Towards a Greater Whole: Understanding Form in the City's Psyche
This thesis investigates the part-to-whole relationship in architectural and urban design, and the dialectic that exists between the conceptual and the perceptual in the built environment.  Working with Gestalt principles and traditional architectural conventions, this projects seeks a greater understanding of how basic graphic relationships enhance our perception of the built environment, in order to find new ways in which architecture can respond to the contemporary city.  This project is located in Seoul, Korea, a city currently lacking a contemporary architectural identity.  It is a city of multiplicity but no coherence, and this thesis seeks to understand how the dynamic relationship between parts in the built environment can encourage greater unity at the scale of architecture and the city.

Population and Employment Densities: Structure and Change
We examine spatial patterns and their changes during the 1970s for the Los Angeles region, by estimating monocentric and polycentric density functions for employment and population. Downtown Los Angeles is clearly identified as the statistical monocentric center of the region, and it is the most consistently strong center in the polycentric patterns. Polycentric models fit statistically better than monocentric models, and there was some shift in employment distribution toward a more polycentric pattern. These findings verify the existence of polycentricity in Los Angeles and demonstrate for the first time that employment and especially population follow a polycentric pattern based on exogenously defined employment centers. The results confirm that both employment and population became more dispersed during the 1970s.

Does Generalizing Density Functions Better Explain Urban Commuting? Some Evidence from the Los Angeles Region
The assumption that urban workers economize on commuting is implicit in urban economic theory. Yet it has been challenged by some recent studies. This paper estimates commute flows implied by three urban density functions: monocentric, polycentric, and dispersive. It finds that an urban density function better predicting the actual spatial patterns also better explains the actual commuting behavior. This finding helps us to preserve the assumption that urban workers make attempts to economize on commuting in their location choices.

Guerrillas Today, What Tomorrow: Transformation of Guerrilla Movements
In recent years, there has become a greater need to understand how rebellious organizations (particularly, guerrilla movements) may transform into new organizations during conflict and following the end of major hostilities. During conflict and following conflict, either rebellious organizations become the new state, cease to exist or they transform into something completely different. In looking specifically at guerrilla movements, one can see many have transformed into other types of organizations including political parties, terrorist organizations, and criminal organizations. This phenomenon leads to the following questions: how do guerrilla movements transform in conflict and post-conflict environments? This study contends this transformation occurs because of the interaction between four independent variables - resources (both physical and human resources), beliefs and associated frames and political accessibility. The manners in which these variables interact are influenced by `who' has the advantage during the conflict - the state or the guerrilla movement and what kind of advantage they have - social, political or resource power advantages. Through the study of two paired comparisons (four individual case studies - the Provisional Irish Republican Army and Sinn Féin PIRA/SF in Northern Ireland, and the Spear of the Nation Umkhonto We Sizwe and the African National Congress MK/ANC in South Africa, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia FARC in Colombia and the Abu Sayyaf Group ASG in the Philippines), this work traces the mechanisms and processes that have lead these organizations to transform into political parties and criminal organizations. Using qualitative comparative methodology (i.e., field interviews, archival research and historical analysis of each former guerrilla movement), this study finds that each transformation is a result of the interaction of the four independent variables in a particular way. These interactions influence the relationship between the various subgroups in the guerrilla movements and therefore, these interactions influence changes in the overall structure of the guerrilla movement. Likewise, these new structures take on different means and ends than when compared to their previous guerrilla movement form.

Umanesimo politico. La monarchia organicista nel IV libro del De obedientia di Giovanni Pontano
Political Humanism, of which Pontano’s De obedientia (1470) is one of the reference texts, possessed the rational and technical elements to outline the features of the Absolutist State with a refined theoretical apparatus. But it also had a secular and humanistic dimension that is lost in the subsequent developments of political theory, marked by the Reason of State and the return of the great military and ecclesiastical aristocracies. The main doctrinal axis on which hinges political humanism is the concept of organicism, namely the representation of society as an organic body inside which every member performs a specific function and the king is its visible representative, a reflection of the unitas that should be the basis for all social and political structure. In De obedientia’s fourth book, Pontano argues in favor of monarchy as the form of government that most closely meets the needs and issues of an organicist society and he outlines the features of the monarchical state. For this purpose, he uses the classical and medieval doctrine (mostly legal) to define the concept of obedience, and thus building it around the concepts of liberalitas and fides, and then loyalty to the sovereign and to the homeland, which is a real focal point in the construction of the new humanistic state. Finally, it tackles the problem of disobedience and rebellion, especially with reference to the great feudal lords.

The Representation of the Modern Mexican Nation in Contemporary Mexican Chronicles
In this study, I explore the national project of the government born from the Mexican Revolution of 1910. This national project consisted of the dissemination of an image of prosperity, economic stability, justice and equal rights for all Mexicans. However, during the 20th Century, different groups erupted to confront the Revolution ideology, its government, and to disarticulate the image of México imposed. The decline of this image started in 1968, which is also the moment when the crónica (chronicle) emerged as a literary genre that indentified with marginal sectors in Mexican society. Also, I study how the crónica of México from the second half of the 20th Century, represents these marginal groups in its struggle for the construction of a nation that would include them. Through the theory of Homi Bhabha , who establishes that nation is a territory in dispute, I examine the representations of "el Movimiento Estudiantil" of 1968, the 1985 earthquake, and the presidential elections of 2006. In addition, I study the representation of the nation space in crónicas that register the marginal periphery of Mexico City and its struggle for the possession of the urban space. In addition, another group that has been marginalized within the national official project is women. I explore the limited inclusion of women in this national project through their access to work and their participation in society. Lastly, the indigenous movements have been the clearest events that show the failure of the Revolution and its agrarian reform. Even though there are few guerrillas, I only analyze the representations of the EZLN movement and its leader Subcomandante Insurgente Marcos. The crónicas selected are by cronistas like: Carlos Monsivais, Elena Poniatowska, Alma Guillermoprieto, Cristina Pacheco, Magali Tercero, Subcomandante Insurgente Marcos, Juan Villoro, and Guadalupe Loaeza.

Campaigns and ethnic polarization in Kenya
This dissertation examines the polarizing effects of electoral competition in Kenya's multiethnic democracy. I argue that polarization results from a combination of the messages parties use to demonize opponents and the tendency by voters to accept more readily messages from co -ethnic leaders. The argument starts with an investigation of campaign targeting decisions. I show, contrary to much of the existing ethnic politics literature, that in Kenya the competition for swing groups (ethnic communities that do not have a co-ethnic leader in the presidential race) is at the heart of electoral contests. The need to attract support across group lines drives message development, leading parties to craft appeals that communicate their inclusive intentions while relying on negative ethnic messages to vilify opponents as ethnic chauvinists. I argue that because of the strong association between ethnicity and trust, voters in the ethnic communities associated with the leading parties internalize messages offered by distinct sets of political elites during campaigns. The result is that negative ethnic appeals exacerbate divisions across communities during the race. To develop and test these claims, I draw on a wide range of empirical evidence collected from Kenya's four multiparty races since the reintroduction of competitive presidential elections in 1991

This dissertation proposes theoretical formalization as a way of enhancing theory development within criminology. Differential association, social learning, social control, and general strain theories are formalized in order to identify assumptions of human nature, key theoretical concepts, theoretical knowledge claims, and scope conditions. The resulting formalization allows greater comparability between theories in terms of explanatory power, and additionally provides insights into integration and elaboration as forms of theory development.

Essays in Development Economics
I study three separate questions in this dissertation. In Chapter 1, I investigate the extent to which credit and insurance market constraints affect occupational choice in rural Kenya. Using data I collected on individuals' subjective beliefs about the returns, costs, and risks associated with the occupations they typically choose from, I find that insurance market constraints prevent people from entering into high-profit but also high-risk occupations. In contrast, I do not find any evidence that credit market failures affect this choice. In Chapter 2, we conduct a randomized experiment to provide improved access to formal financial services in Western Kenya. We find low take-up and use of savings accounts and loans even after we waived account opening fees, provided information about loans, and lowered eligibility requirements to get credit. Survey evidence suggests people remain unbanked mainly due to the poor quality of banking services offered in the area (high fees, lack of trust, and unreliable service). In Chapter 3, I examine the effect of women's education on fertility and child health outcomes in Uganda. Women who get additional schooling reduce their preferences for family size: they delay the onset of fertility and reduce the total number of children they have overall. At the same time, mothers with more education invest more in their children's health and their children are better nourished. I find evidence that this child quantity-quality trade-off is driven by educated women's improved employment opportunities. In addition, schooling helps women exert more control over their reproductive lives. However, I find no evidence that more educated women increase bargaining power over other household decisions.
