Brief intervention to reduce alcohol use among men who have sex with men
Introduction : Men who have sex with men (MSM) who abuse alcohol are at increased risk for unprotected sexual intercourse, which may lead to transmission of HIV. Although there is no definitive causal link between alcohol use and risky sexual behavior, the two behaviors are highly correlated. Design : A randomized control trial was designed to test a brief alcohol intervention against an attention-placebo control intervention. A sample of 152 MSM were recruited over 13 weeks at a local gay bar. Sober bar patrons were recruited prior to entering the bar and asked to complete a brief assessment and receive feedback. Patrons were randomly assigned to receive feedback on their planned alcohol use or on their carbon footprint (attention-placebo control condition). This scripted feedback, based on the health belief model, was tailored to the individual through a brief assessment. Participants were asked to complete a brief survey and give a breath sample at exit from the bar. Participants were followed-up within one week to assess alcohol-related problems and sexual activity following the interview night. Findings : Breath alcohol concentrations (BrAC) at exit from the bar were not significantly different between those in the experimental alcohol feedback condition and those in the attention-placebo control condition. Among participants receiving the experimental brief alcohol intervention, those categorized as high-risk for alcohol-related problems at entrance drank significantly less than planned as compared to participants categorized as low-risk for alcohol related problems (F=13.9, p<0.001). Further, participants categorized as high-risk at entrance drove at a significantly lower rate than participants categorized as low-risk and at-risk (x2=8.9, p<0.05). Discussion: This brief alcohol intervention did not significantly reduce BrAC at exit from the bar for the group as a whole. However, evidence indicates that this intervention was more appropriate for those who planned to drink at rates that would put them at higher risk of alcohol related problems as compared to those who were at low-risk of alcohol related problems

Homeward Bound: Food-Related Transportation Strategies in Low Income and Transit Dependent Communities
In 1993, a UCLA research team published a comprehensive study of the food system, Seeds of Change: Strategies for Food Security for the Inner City. The study included a detailed case study evaluating the ability of the food system to meet the needs of the residents of one South Central Los Angeles neighborhood. As part of that evaluation, the study documented a wide range of food insecurity indicators:
      - 27% of area residents reported they went hungry an average of five days every month;
      - The absence of nearby supermarkets was compounded by lower than average vehicle ownership. Further, bus lines did not correspond to market location. As a result, the lack of transportation for food buying purposes was defined by residents as a major community problem;
      - Food prices for residents of the case study area – who spent 36% of their annual income on food – averaged $275 more per year than residents of a selected suburban area who spent 12% of their income on food;
      - The lack of fresh quality produce illustrated the issue of nutritional deficiencies and related health and learning problems that are endemic in low income areas.

Inhalation intake of ambient air pollution in California's South Coast Air Basin
Reliable estimates of inhalation intake of air pollution and its distribution among a specified population are important for environmental epidemiology, health risk assessment, urban planning, and environmental policy. We computed distributional characteristics of the inhalation intake of five pollutants for a group of ~25,000 people (~29,000 person-days) living in California’s South Coast Air Basin. Our approach incorporates four main inputs: temporally resolved information about people’s location (latitude and longitude), microenvironment, and activity level; temporally and spatially explicit model determinations of ambient concentrations; stochastically determined microenvironmental adjustment factors relating the exposure concentration to the ambient concentration; and, age-, gender-, and activity-specific breathing rates. Our study is restricted to pollutants of outdoor origin, i.e. it does not incorporate intake in a microenvironment from direct emissions into that microenvironment. Median estimated inhalation intake rates (μgd-1) are 53 for benzene, 5.1 for 1,3-butadiene, 8.7x10-4 for hexavalent chromium in fine particulate matter (Cr-PM2.5), 30 for diesel fine particulate matter (DPM2.5), and 68 for ozone. For the four primary pollutants studied, estimated median intake rates are higher for non-whites and for individuals in low-income households than for the population as a whole. For ozone, a secondary pollutant, the reverse is true. Accounting for microenvironmental adjustment factors, population mobility and temporal correlations between pollutant concentrations and breathing rates affects the estimated inhalation intake by 40% on average. The approach presented here could be extended to quantify the impact on intakes and intake distributions of proposed changes in emissions, air quality, and urban infrastructure.

Lateral Snow Transport, Fire and Changing Treelines in Mount San Gorgonio, California, U.S.A.
The mountain tree line correlates with the limit of carbon gain in photosynthesis, a temperature dependent process linked to atmospheric lapse rates.  Studies of tree lines often do not focus on specific mechanisms that limit their distributions, including lateral snow transport (LST) and snow drifting, as well as wildfires. At Mount San Gorgonio (elevation 3505 m) in the eastern San Bernardino Mountains, 130 km east of Los Angeles, the subalpine forest tree-line (Pinus flexilis, P. contorta) has been stable over the 20th century.  Above 3000 m blowing snow and snow drifting associated with the jet stream, combined with topographic wind enhancement, including forests denuded by fires, can significantly affect timberline dynamics. The reduction of surface roughness due to tree removal accelerates LST and lowers the timberline on leeward slopes subject to increased snow deposition. This paper evaluates LST at three ridgeline timberline sites in the San Gorgonio Wilderness that were burned in 1863, 1869 and 1951. Post-fire tree growth response is measured by using 200 m long sampling quadrats that traversed from windward to leeward slopes. Metrics include tree cover, height and diameter data. The results indicate that the LST is enhanced by fire which increases wind speeds, windward slope snow ablation, and leeward slope snow deposition, slowing tree establishment and growth. In the krummholz zone near San Gorgonio summit, recurrent damage from wind, snow and ice produce shear injury to windward slope tree canopies downwind (northeastward), result in continuous LST.  On leeward slopes, late summer or perennial snow cover, maintains bare zones (tree lines) due to tree mortality, the snow decrease the growing season and increase the probability of tree death.  At global scales, the tree line is predicted to ascend mountain slopes with planetary warming because the upper elevation boundary of woody vegetation is assumed to represent temperature limitations to positive net photosynthesis.  An essential issue in the growth of plant canopy is the separation of intrinsic productivity from physical dieback over ecological time scales:  What is carbon gain in canopy versus the rate of canopy removal due to wind-driven disturbances and snow burial over the life of the tree that reduces photosynthetic capacities?  Without mass loss from LST, a hypothetical increase in forest canopy would permit tree colonization to higher elevations than the modern empirical limit.  These findings are applicable to other mountain ranges at temperate latitudes subject to jet stream induced LST, and must be accounted for in the observation and prediction of tree lines in response to global climate change.

The role of impulsivity, affect, and expectations in alcohol use and disordered eating
Alcohol use and eating disorders are a major public health concern for women in late adolescence and early adulthood. Emotion based impulsivity represents one process by which the experience of strong emotions may generally predispose some individuals to engage in rash behavior, including dysfunctional eating and drinking. In two sessions, the present study examined positive and negative urgency in relationship to dysfunctional eating and drinking, cognitive expectations about food and alcohol, affect regulation variables, and as a potential correlate of a behavioral task. 1,060 undergraduate college females were examined on measures of impulsivity, expectations, affect lability, depression, alcohol use, alcohol-related problems, and disordered eating; 190 returned for a second session involving a behavioral task following mood manipulation. Among this sample of young adult college females, greater levels of negative urgency were affiliated with alcohol related consequences and disordered eating, above and beyond other sub-facets of impulsivity, depressive symptoms, and volatile affect. Negative urgency was especially heightened among females with co-occurring problem drinking and disordered eating symptoms, versus non-disordered controls and females with either set of symptoms alone. While positive urgency was related to alcohol-related problems above and beyond use rates, it did not add significant predictive power after controlling for other impulsivity sub-facets. Results demonstrate the urgency traits are unique predictors of disordered eating and problematic drinking, independent of depression and affect lability. Females who were elevated on the urgency traits and who held expectations regarding the reinforcing properties of food and alcohol tended to experience the greatest levels of dysfunction. Session two results indicated that while errors of commission on the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) were affiliated with increased levels of lack of premeditation when individuals were in neutral mood states, SART responding was unrelated to self reported impulsivity in positive or negative mood states. This study supplements research on the mechanisms and risk factors that underlie these disorders, and has clinical implications for mental health assessment, prevention and treatment

Theoretical and Empirical Studies of Sex Ratios, Mainly in Fig Wasps
The area of sex-ratio theory known as 'local mate competition' is analyzed and extended. New models are presented by adding several realistic assumptions to previous work, including (i) different clutch sizes among females, and (ii) different mating-group sizes within a population. Also, following Hamilton's general formulation for local mate competition, insights into several related sex-ratio phenomena are discussed. These include conflict situations over the sex ratio, and the effect of asymmetric relatedness of parents to sons versus parents to daughters on the sex ratio.The new theory generated in this thesis is applied to data I collected on the sex ratios of Florida fig wasps, Pegoscapus assuetus Grandi and P. jimenezi Grandi, which pollinate the fig species Ficus citrifolia P. Miller and F. aurea Nuttall, respectively. These empirical studies were conducted in the Everglades National Park and on Key Largo, Florida. Due to their unique natural history, fig wasps are an ideal system for the study of local mate competition in natural populations. The number of female fig wasps colonizing an isolated, locally mating patch (= a fig) was experimentally controlled, and the sex ratio as a function of foundress number was measured. The qualitative agreement between predictions and observations is excellent; however, the observed sex ratios are consistently more female biased than predicted. A theoretical exploration of some factors that may explain this quantitative discrepancy is presented. Two a priori candidates are the most compelling at this time: (i) different clutch sizes among females within an isolated, locally mating group, and (ii) genetic differentiation among subpopulations of fig wasps. Empirical methods for the further study of fig wasp sex ratios are discussed extensively. Additionally, information and discussion is presented on the natural history of Florida fig wasps, their nematode and wasp parasites, the mechanism of sex-ratio adjustment, and breeding structure of the wasps, including subpopulation structure, the number of foundresses per fig and the cues assessed by the wasps when choosing a fig in which to oviposit.Fig wasps provide an excellent opportunity for evaluating sex-ratio theory and the success of population-genetic models in predicting behavior patterns accurately. The wasps are easily observed, important parameters can be readily quantified in natural populations, and they are amenable to experimentation in the field. Also, since there are 900 fig wasp species, this group provides a rich source of comparative information.

Diverse captive non-human primates with phytanic acid-deficient diets rich in plant products have substantial phytanic acid levels in their red blood cells
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Humans and rodents with impaired phytanic acid (PA) metabolism can accumulate toxic stores of PA that have deleterious effects on multiple organ systems. Ruminants and certain fish obtain PA from the microbial degradation of dietary chlorophyll and/or through chlorophyll-derived precursors. In contrast, humans cannot derive PA from chlorophyll and instead normally obtain it only from meat, dairy, and fish products.
				
				
					
						Results
					Captive apes and Old world monkeys had significantly higher red blood cell (RBC) PA levels relative to humans when all subjects were fed PA-deficient diets. Given the adverse health effects resulting from PA over accumulation, we investigated the molecular evolution of thirteen PA metabolism genes in apes, Old world monkeys, and New world monkeys. All non-human primate (NHP) orthologs are predicted to encode full-length proteins with the marmoset Phyh gene containing a rare, but functional, GA splice donor dinucleotide. Acox2, Scp2, and Pecr sequences had amino acid positions with accelerated substitution rates while Amacr had significant variation in evolutionary rates in apes relative to other primates.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Unlike humans, diverse captive NHPs with PA-deficient diets rich in plant products have substantial RBC PA levels. The favored hypothesis is that NHPs can derive significant amounts of PA from the degradation of ingested chlorophyll through gut fermentation. If correct, this raises the possibility that RBC PA levels could serve as a biomarker for evaluating the digestive health of captive NHPs. Furthermore, the evolutionary rates of the several genes relevant to PA metabolism provide candidate genetic adaptations to NHP diets.

Evaluation of dietary intake of lactating women in China and its potential impact on the health of mothers and infants
AbstractBackgroundOptimal nutrition for lactating mothers is importance for mother and infants&#8217; health and well-being. We determined the nutrient intake and dietary changes during the first 3-month of lactation, and its potential effect on health and disease risk.MethodPersonal interviews were conducted to collect a 24h diet recall questionnaire from 199 healthy lactating women in the postpartum days 2, 7, 30, 90 and healthy 58 non-pregnant women served as the controls.ResultsWe found in lactating women (1) the mean daily energy and carbohydrate intake was lower than that of the Chinese Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI, 2600 Kcal, 357.5&#8201;~&#8201;422.5g) by 11%&#8201;~&#8201;17% and 33%&#8201;~&#8201;49%, respectively; (2) the fat intake increased from 3% to 13%, which was 9&#8201;~&#8201;77% higher than the RNI (57&#8201;~&#8201;86.7g); (3) the protein intake exceeded the RNI of 85g by 32&#8201;~&#8201;53%; (4) the total calories consumed from carbohydrate (39%-44%), fat (34%&#8201;~&#8201;42%) and protein (20%-23%) failed to meet Chinese RNI (5) the intake of vitamin C, B1, folate, zinc, dietary fiber, and calcium was 5%&#8201;~&#8201;73% lower than the RNI while vitamin B2, B3, E, iron and selenium intake was 20% to 3 times higher than the RNI. Nutrient intake in the control group was lower for all nutrients than the recommended RNI.ConclusionLactating women on a self-selected diet did not meet the Chinese RNI for many important micronutrients, which may influence the nutritional composition of breast milk and thus impact the potential health of mothers and infants. RNI should consider the regional dietary habits and culture. A single national RNI is not applicable for all of China. Nutritional education into the community is needed.

Typical Clothing Ensemble Insulation Levels for Sixteen Body Parts
In order to accurately simulate skin and core temperatures and thermal comfort, some human physiology and comfort models now divide the human body into multiple body parts (such as head, hand, chest etc).  Most of these parts are normally covered with clothing insulation, which must be quantified in the simulation. Unfortunately, existing clothing insulation databases only characterize clothing insulation for the whole body, not for individual body parts.  That means every body part has the same clothing insulation level, even over the head and hands.  In this study, we measured clothing insulation for 40 typical clothing ensembles using a 16-segment thermal manikin, and present here the insulation values for each body part, as well as for the whole body.

Selenium Accumulation in Brassicaceae Plant Species and its Biotransfer to Insect Pollinators
Selenium (Se) has contaminated soils and plants in the western USA and other regions where pollination can be critical to the functioning of both agricultural and natural ecosystems, yet we know very little about how pollutants can impact insect pollinators.  The overall goal of this dissertation was to investigate both the toxic effects of a plant-accumulated pollutant (Se) on a common pollinator, the honey bee (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic> L., Hymenoptera: Apidae).  	I investigated the accumulation of Se in two phytoremediating species, <italic>Brassica juncea</italic> and <italic>Stanleya pinnata</italic>.  The plants were irrigated in the greenhouse with selenate, and accumulated significantly quantities in the nectar (110 and 150 µg Se ml<super>-1</super> ww) and pollen (1700 and 12900 µg Se g<super>-1</super> dw, respectively).  These concentrations are much higher than the Se LC<sub>50</sub>'s for certain insects.	I used proboscis extension reflex bioassays to determine if the Se affected the gustatory response of honey bee foragers.  Antennal stimulation with selenomethionine reduced PER at higher concentrations.  Foragers dosed with selenate had higher mortality and reduced responses to sucrose, which may lead to decreases in incoming floral resources needed to support coworkers and larvae in the colony.  	In a semi-field study, the weedy plant <italic>Raphanus sativus</italic> (radish) was exposed to selenate watering treatments to evaluate the effects on pollination ecology.  Honey bee pollinators were observed to readily forage on <italic>R. sativus</italic> for both pollen and nectar despite high floral Se concentrations.  Se treatments increased seed abortion and decreased plant biomass, but herbivory by birds and aphids was also reduced, indicating a potential tradeoff of phytotoxicity and protection from Se.  	I used artificial diet bioassays to determine the toxicity of four Se compounds that occur in accumulating plants.  <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> larvae were chronically fed Se, and the inorganic forms were more toxic (LC<sub>50</sub> selenate = 0.72 µg g<super>-1</super>, LC<sub>50</sub> selenite = 1.03 µg g<super>-1</super>) than the organic forms (LC<sub>50</sub> methylselenocysteine = 4.09 µg g<super>-1</super>, LC<sub>50</sub> selenomethionine = 6.04 µg g<super>-1</super>).   All four forms decreased the percentage of larvae that pupated, and selenate and methylselenocysteine significantly decreased larval growth rates.  Taken together, the dissertation research from the past five years represents a crucial first step towards understanding the impact environmental stressors can have on pollinator-plant interactions and specifically, the honey bee, <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>.

Ray L. Travers: Three Generations of Apple Farming in Watsonville, California 1875-1977
In 1977 the Regional History Project interviewed Ray L. Travers, a native of Watsonville, California, and a major figure in Pajaro Valley agriculture, as part of its series of oral histories documenting local agricultural and ethnic history.
      Travers was born in 1921 into the thriving community of Portuguese immigrants from the Azores, who began settling in the valley during the 1870s. His paternal grandparents arrived in Boston about 1875, where they met and married. They traveled by train across the country and settled in Green Valley in Santa Cruz County in 1876, where a distant relative lived. They bought some land, planted an apple orchard, and eventually farmed 200 acres while raising a family of 13 children. Travers's maternal grandfather was a whaler and his grandmother a Monterey native.
      Travers's recollections begin with a description of his family's early history in the Pajaro Valley during the 1870s. He gives the details of family farming practiced by his grandfather's generation when the whole family worked side-by-side in the orchards. He discusses the many apple varieties which were then grown and how they changed over the years according to the dictates of the market. He also speaks about the Portuguese community's food, customs, and festivals in the valley and throughout the state.
      Travers's father was an apple grower, and one of the first farmers in the valley to grow lettuce in the 1920s. In 1939 he became partners with the Sakata family and established an apple packing shed. When a fire destroyed the shed he sold out to Sakata, who continued growing lettuce. After World War II, he rebuilt the storage plant and farmed 27 separate parcels of land, including 130 acres of apple orchards. Travers describes his father's farming practices, and the use of pesticides, which included lead, sulphur and oil sprayed with hand guns. He also discusses the various ethnic groups who have worked in valley agriculture during the twentieth century. After Travers's father and mother died he continued apple orchard farming, eventually farming 250 acres.
      In his narration he describes “old style” apple storage when the fruit was packed in wooden crates and stored in the shade in redwood groves. This practice was replaced in the 1930s when orchardists began storing apples in cold packing sheds. During this period, researchers at UC Davis and elsewhere attempted to find ways to maintain the quality of the apples in storage over an extended period. Experiments focused on temperature control and the sealing of fruit in poly liners. In 1935 several Watsonville growers stored 20,000 boxes of Newtown Pippins in poly liners at forty degrees but this commercial test failed to prevent spoilage.
      In 1956 Ray Travers was the first apple grower on the West Coast to introduce controlled atmosphere storage for apples, a technique originally pioneered in England. This was a sophisticated, scientifically-based development in preserving apples, which extended their storage life by four to six months beyond what had been possible in cold storage and eliminated browning and rotting.
      The Agricultural Research Department of the Gerber Products Company, purveyor of baby food, wanted to retain the peak quality of apples during a long period of processing and was interested in finding a storage method which would achieve this. The company worked with Travers and in 1956 they stored 18,000 boxes of Newtown Pippins in a gas-tight room in Travers's Watsonville cold storage house. This new technique required having a low temperature in the storage room, and maintaining a low oxygen and high carbon-dioxide content in the atmosphere. As they experimented with this new kind of commercial storage, they established the optimum temperatures and gas concentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide, which eliminated internal flesh browning, and retained the nutritional value of the apples over an extended period. Subsequently, this technique has become standard in the industry.
      Travers's narration also includes his overview of apple farming, the introduction of dwarf apple tree varieties, and the vicissitudes and economics of farming in the 1970s-- the need for substantial capital investment, the high price of land, and the nature of the highly competitive agricultural market. His views on the growing suburbanization of the Pajaro Valley are prescient in describing the real estate trends in California where agricultural lands are at risk, being bought up for housing developments.

From Vitamin C to Metabolite Repair: The Role of Novel Sugar Nucleotide Phosphorylases
The <italic>pcm-1</italic> gene in the soil nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> that encodes the L- isoaspartyl methyltransferase has roles in protein repair as well as in the worm's insulin-like signaling pathway. Interestingly, the <italic>pcm-1</italic> gene displays overlapping exon sequences with a previously undescribed gene (<italic>mcp-1, C10F3.4</italic>) that is transcribed from the opposite strand. This rare topology in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome (less than 0.05% of all genes) led us to ask whether the expression of the <italic>pcm-1</italic> and <italic>mcp-1</italic> genes may be co-regulated or whether their products may have a related function. PSI-BLAST analyses revealed that MCP-1 has homologs in plants, vertebrates and invertebrates and that all the homologs share a conserved HIT (histidine triad) motif. Mutations in the Arabidopsis thaliana homolog, <italic>vtc2</italic>, lead to vitamin C deficiency in these plants.	In this thesis, I have characterized the enzymatic activity of VTC2 from <italic>A. thaliana</italic> as a GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase, the last missing step in the Smirnoff-Wheeler pathway for vitamin C biosynthesis in plants. Additional work has been done to show that the green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> shares homologs with all of the genes in the Smirnoff-Wheeler pathway as well as the specific activity of GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase.While vitamin C is an apparent important antioxidant and enzymatic cofactor in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, no reports had been made as to the ability of this nematode to produce it. In my work I found out that <italic>C. elegans</italic> extracts contain low levels of vitamin C. Nevertheless, as levels of vitamin C in the <italic>mcp-1</italic> deletion strain are not different from the values in the control animals and as <italic>C. elegans</italic> lack key homologs in the biosynthesis pathway, I concluded that <italic>mcp-1</italic> was not involved in vitamin C synthesis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.Enzymatic analysis revealed that <italic>C. elegans &rsquo; mcp-1</italic> and its mammalian homologs encode GDP-D-glucose phosphorylases. <italic>mcp-1</italic> mutant worms that lacked this activity accumulated GDP-D-glucose. This unique metabolite, which shares high similarity with GDP-D-mannose, does not have a reported role in invertebrates or mammals. With my collaborators, I suggested that GDP-D-glucose could compete with GDP-D-mannose for binding to glycosyltransferases in the first steps of protein N-glycosylation in the cell, thus potentially replacing mannose residues with glucose residues in a step that could lead to N-glycosylation defect. Thus, MCP-1 may serve as a metabolite repair enzyme that eliminates adventitiously formed GDP-D-glucose from the cytosol to ensure correct protein N-glycosylation. I have tested this hypothesis by observing morphological changes in <italic>mcp-1</italic> mutant worms and by directly comparing the N-glycan profiles of <italic>mcp-1</italic> and control animals.

Suckling Behavior in Domestic Goats:  Interaction Between Litter Size and Kid Sex
Studies of milk allocation in polytocous species provide the opportunity to investigate the effects of offspring number and sex ratio on maternal investment. In these species maternal control over milk allocation is more difficult because physiological limits on milk production may stimulate sibling competition. This study investigated the nursing behavior of domestic goats bearing twins or singletons in an experimental situation for the first 47 days post-partum. Milk yield and composition did not correlate with litter size, kid weight, or with the behavior of kids. Males were heavier than females, but there were no sex differences in behaviors related to nursing. Milk allocation differences existed between twins and singletons, even though, on the average, there were no significant weight differences. However, one twin was always larger than the other. Twins spent less time in proximity to the mother than did the singletons, and were more responsible for achieving proximity to the mother. These results suggest that nursing behavior was more affected by litter size than by sex of young, although there might be an interaction between both, that early mother-young interactions were different for twins and singletons, and that kids played an active role in the allocation of milk and its conversion to body weight.

Insights into mechanism of alcohol mediated modulation of GIRK channels
Ion channels are proteins that control the flow of ions in and out of the cell. They are important in many aspects of human physiology such as muscle contraction, sensory perception, thought and behavior. Ethanol is the most common drug of abuse worldwide. Ethanol modulates numerous ion channels, but the exact mechanism of modulation has been elusive. My dissertation investigates how ethanol and other alcohols modulate the activity of G-protein gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels. GIRK channels are members of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel family that regulate the resting membrane potential of excitable cells. They are ubiquitously expressed in the brain and the heart. In the neurons, opening of GIRK channel leads to inhibition of neuronal firing. Ethanol activates GIRK channel in neurons. However, exactly how ethanol activates GIRK channels is not known. In this dissertation, I first used structure-based mutagenesis and electrophysiology to determine that alcohols act on a hydrophobic pocket in the cytoplasmic domain of GIRK channels resulting in channel activation. To strengthen this finding, I used thiol modifying reagents targeted to the hydrophobic pocket to show that this pocket is important for activation of GIRK channels. To determine the mechanism of this alcohol mediated activation of GIRK channels, I studied the requirement of G-proteins and PIP₂ and found that alcohol activates GIRK channels in a G-protein independent, but PIP₂ dependent manner. I then studied single channel properties of alcohol activated GIRK channels. I found that alcohols increase the frequency of channel opening. Combining structural models and functional data, I present a novel model for alcohol mediated activation of GIRK channels. In this model, alcohol facilitates spontaneous opening of GIRK channels by binding to the hydrophobic alcohol pocket and opening its cytoplasmic gate. This work contributes to our fundamental understanding of how ethanol modulates ion channels and how GIRK channels are gated

Contaminant levels and source strengths in U.S. retail stores A pilot study
SUMMARY
Retail stores have many sources of indoor air contaminants that can cause potential health and odor concerns. One way to control exposure to these contaminants is to provide adequate ventilation. This study aims to characterize the whole-building emission rates of contaminants in certain retail types. The pilot study included two grocery stores and three furniture stores in northern California. We measured simultaneously the building ventilation rates by SF6 decay and contaminant concentrations in each store for one to two days. Contaminants were measured at multiple indoor locations and at one outdoor location near the building. Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein are three compounds with concentrations above health guidelines in some stores. In several cases, indoor concentrations of certain VOCs and PM were higher indoors than outdoors, suggesting potential indoor sources. Our goal is to characterize the range of contaminant source strengths in 25 to 30 stores in California.

Identification of demand in differentiated products markets
This dissertation contains four essays at the intersection of econometrics and industrial organization. In all my chapters, I rely on a detailed set of supermarket scanner data on ready-to-eat cereals. In Chapter 1, I examine identification of price effects for differentiated product markets by relying on a conditional form of exogeneity that is an alternative framework to standard instrumental variables. I simulate price changes in the cereal industry arising from potential mergers between firms, one of which took place in 2008. In Chapter 2, I continue to employ conditional exogeneity to identify the effect of market price on demand for differentiated products. The analysis here departs from past studies of demand in several ways, including relaxing the prevalent assumption that observed product characteristics are exogenous. Estimates of implied price-cost margins based on the conditional exogeneity framework are far more reasonable and stable compared to estimates based on standard instrumental variables procedures. In Chapter 3, we (coauthored with Xun Lu) relax the omnipresent assumption that indirect utility takes a linear-separable parametric form in standard logit models of demand. We rely on conditional independence to structurally identify and nonparametrically estimate the average marginal effect of market price on consumer demand. We find that the effect of price on demand is monotonically increasing in price, resulting in high-priced goods having less elastic own price elasticities, and thus higher implied price-cost margins, which addresses a well-known concern in empirical industrial organization. In Chapter 4, I examine a firm's decision to raise price overtly (by increasing the dollar amount of a good) versus a hidden price change (by decreasing the contents in a good's package). I conduct a comprehensive set of empirical analyses in order to assess the impact of hidden price increases on expenditure share and profitability. During July 2007, General Mills decreased the cereal content for 20 out of 23 of their products in my sample of scanner data. A key finding is that consumers tend to notice hidden price changes on smaller-sized boxes of cereal, leading them to substitute to larger-sized boxes of cereal

Decolonizing our plates : analyzing San Diego and vegans of color food politics
This project focuses on discursive formations of race, gender, class, and sexuality within food justice movements as well as these discursive formations within veganism. In particular, I analyze how mainstream food justice movements in San Diego engage in discourses of colorblindness, universalism, individualism, whiteness, and consumption. I also examine how these movements are centered on possessive individualism, or one's capacity to own private property, as the means through which they seek and obtain liberation. Through my participant observation at several San Diego food justice events, I demonstrate that these movements often discursively exclude communities of color and poor communities as its subjects. In addition, I analyze four vegan of color sites: the song "Be Healthy" by the hip hop group Dead Prez, eco-chef Bryant Terry's cookbook Vegan Soul Food, the Vegans of Color blog, and an anthology entitled Sistah Vegan! Black Female Vegans Speak on Food, Identity, Health, and Society. Through a cultural studies analysis, I explore the ways in which these sites engage a decolonial, anti- oppressive framework to guide their vegan politics. In this project, I seek to contribute to the works of those who have written about the relationship between race, class, gender, and space, as well as the fields of food studies and ethnic studies, through a critique of food justice movements' reproduction of common sense logics about subjecthood and difference as well as decolonial possibilities within veganism

Chemical and Structural Features of Plants That Contribute to Biomass Recalcitrance
Currently, the primary barrier to low cost biological conversion of cellulosic biomass to renewable fuels is a plant's recalcitrance to sugar release.  The energy-intensive pretreatments and high enzyme loadings that are typically required to obtain high sugar yields result in elevated processing costs that must be reduced in order to make cellulosic fuels competitive with those derived from petroleum feedstocks.  To lower processing costs, the natural recalcitrance of biomass must be overcome either through the identification and use of superior biomass candidates with reduced recalcitrance, the development of enzymes that are more effective, and/or the design and implementation of efficient pretreatment processes to reduce plants' recalcitrance prior to enzymatic conversion.  Unfortunately, the current understanding of biomass recalcitrance is extremely limited, which makes such options difficult.  Thus, this thesis will address the vital need for a better understanding of what plant structural and chemical features cause biomass recalcitrance and how they can be overcome with pretreatment. Towards this end, three main objectives were pursued in this thesis.  First, downscaled and high throughput tools were developed for screening large sets of biomass samples for composition as well as for sugar release from pretreatment and enzymatic saccharification.  Next, the implementation of these tools facilitated the screening of multiple sets of biomass samples to identify superior feedstock candidates and general trends in sugar release behavior.  Finally, from these trends, a more detailed analysis was undertaken for select species in order to investigate what plant structural and chemical features contribute most heavily to biomass recalcitrance and how pretreatment processes overcome these limitations to achieve high sugar yields in subsequent enzymatic saccharification.

Adolescents with prenatal cocaine exposure show subtle alterations in striatal surface morphology and frontal cortical volumes
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Published structural neuroimaging studies of prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) in humans have yielded somewhat inconsistent results, with several studies reporting no significant differences in brain structure between exposed subjects and controls. Here, we sought to clarify some of these discrepancies by applying methodologies that allow for the detection of subtle alterations in brain structure.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					We applied surface-based anatomical modeling methods to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to examine regional changes in the shape and volume of the caudate and putamen in adolescents with prenatal cocaine exposure (n&#8201;=&#8201;40, including 28 exposed participants and 12 unexposed controls, age range 14 to 16 years). We also sought to determine whether changes in regional brain volumes in frontal and subcortical regions occurred in adolescents with PCE compared to control participants.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					The overall volumes of the caudate and putamen did not significantly differ between PCE participants and controls. However, we found significant (P &lt;0.05, uncorrected) effects of levels of prenatal exposure to cocaine on regional patterns of striatal morphology. Higher levels of prenatal cocaine exposure were associated with expansion of certain striatal subregions and with contraction in others. Volumetric analyses revealed no significant changes in the volume of any subcortical region of interest, but there were subtle group differences in the volumes of some frontal cortical regions, in particular reduced volumes of caudal middle frontal cortices and left lateral orbitofrontal cortex in exposed participants compared to controls.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					Prenatal cocaine exposure may lead to subtle and regionally specific patterns of regional dysmorphology in the striatum and volumetric changes in the frontal lobes. The localized and bidirectional nature of effects may explain in part the contradictions in the existing literature.

Incentives & Nutrition For Rotten Kids: The Quantity & Quality Of Food Allocated Within Philippine Households
We construct a model of food demand which distinguishes between the nutrients supplied by a particular food bundle and the quality of that bundle, as measured by its cost. We show that when nutrition affects only utility then under rather general conditions it will be optimal for all members of the household to consume food bundles of identical quality. This is true even when household members have private information about their actions—in this case thequantityof food given may provide incentives, but quality remains common within the household. When nutrition affects household resources our finding that quality is constant is overturned—in this case when the household invests more in the nutrition of one member it will simultaneouslyreducethe quality of her food bundle.
      Using data on individual-level food consumption from a sample of farm households in the Philippines, we estimate and test a dynamic model of intra-household food allocation. We find that individual consumption shares respond to individual earnings shocks. At least part of this response is due to nutritional investments, but it appears that the allocation of food also plays a role in providing incentives within the household.

The Mind of Organisms:  Some Issues About Animal Cognition
The study of animal behavior and intelligence has a fairly long tradition, starting with Romanes naive mentalism. With a few noble exceptions, like Tolman and Kohler, psychological research on animals has been dominated by the behaviorist paradigm, and only in the last fifteen years has there been a substantial growth of interest in the analysis of cognitive processes in animals. This renewed impetus towards a cognitive approach, as opposed to a strict behaviorist perspective, resulted from both internal problems and external influences: on the one hand, there were difficulties in explaining all instances of behavior within the traditional S-R approach; on the other, mental concepts were gaining a new scientific respectability, thanks to the development of human cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence

Access to food outlets and children's nutritional intake in urban China: a difference-in-difference analysis
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					In recent years supermarkets and fast food restaurants have been replacing those &#8220;wet markets&#8221; of independent vendors as the major food sources in urban China. Yet how these food outlets relate to children&#8217;s nutritional intake remains largely unexplored.
				
				
					
						Method
					Using a longitudinal survey of households and communities in China, this study examines the effect of the urban built food environment (density of wet markets, density of supermarkets, and density of fast food restaurants) on children&#8217;s nutritional intake (daily caloric intake, daily carbohydrate intake, daily protein intake, and daily fat intake). Children aged 6&#8211;18 (n&#8201;=&#8201;185) living in cities were followed from 2004 to 2006, and difference-in-difference models are used to address the potential issue of omitted variable bias.
				
				
					
						Results
					Results suggest that the density of wet markets, rather than that of supermarkets, positively predicts children&#8217;s four dimensions of nutritional intake. In the caloric intake model and the fat intake model, the positive effect of neighborhood wet market density on children&#8217;s nutritional intake is stronger with children from households of lower income.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					With their cheaper prices and/or fresher food supply, wet markets are likely to contribute a substantial amount of nutritional intake for children living nearby, especially those in households with lower socioeconomic status. For health officials and urban planners, this study signals a sign of warning as wet markets are disappearing from urban China&#8217;s food environment.

Rat Behavior in the Exploration Box - Cluster Analysis
The main objective of this study was to provide a description of the possible patterns of rat behaviour in the exploration box. Both age and sex of the animals were controlled. The measures taken assessed changes in the patterns of behavioural activity over time. Sex did not differentiate the rat's behaviour significantly. Two patterns of developmental changes were found. The results of cluster analysis with a sequential data sets lead to the conclusion that there are at least two levels of regulation of rat behaviour: activation and content organization. It was also shown that rat behaviour in the exploration box is not stereotyped but highly plastic. The results are discussed in terms of development, sex differences and individual differences.

Efficiency enhancement of luminescent solar concentrations for photovoltaic technologies
Solar energy is a prominent renewable source of electricity if cheap methods
are designed for its concentration and conversion. With the purpose of improving
power conversion efficiency and lowering the cost, luminescent solar concentrations
(LSCs) are developed for collecting and concentrating both direct and diffuse light
for Photovoltaic systems without tracking.
Nano-structured near infrared PbS quantum dots (QDs) as new luminescent materials are identified. This material is optically characterized by using steady state spectroscopic technologies and electrically characterized by outdoor
testing. These properties are also compared with visible CdSe/ZnS QDs for LSC
PV systems and organic dye LSC PV systems. The results show the promising
future of near infrared QDs as luminescent material for LSCs if their stability can
be properly controlled.
Techniques for fabrication and characterization of LSCs as "smart" windows
are developed. A range of prototypes are fabricated, optically and electrically characterized. A variety of optimal designs for improving the output power conversion
efficiency are investigated both for QDs LSCs and for organic dye LSCs. For LSCs
with organic dyes, the size dependent optimization methods are developed for both
one layer and stacked structures.
The largest fabricated prototype has 60cm by 120cm by 0.32cm. It yields
electric gain 4.23, which is much larger than that of fixed concentrators based on
geometrical optics. Prototypes fabricated with new outdoor use organic laser dyes
show the same electric gain but with 5.88x smaller in size 2.67x larger in optical 
efficiency. This results show that LSCs fabricated with outdoor use organic dyes
are very promising if applied into stacked structures.
New generation LSCs with liquid crystals as matrix materials are explored.
Properties of liquid crystals and dyes for the new generation LSCs are analyzed
with the predicted theoretical improvement for trapping efficiency up to 21.3%.
Such anisotropic LSCs containing identified organic dyes are successfully fabricated and optically characterized. Performances of these LSCs are compared with
isotropic samples.

The Long-Term Effects of Juvenile Food Availability on Adult Reproductive Decisions and Success in Trinidadian Guppies (Poecilia reticulata)
Food availability during the juvenile stage can a have profound impact on adult performance and fitness. Low food availability early in life generally leads to slower growth and development and maturation at an older age and smaller size, which can then lead to reduced survival and lifetime reproductive success. There is increasing evidence that organisms can respond to these early setbacks and in ways that might be adaptive. However, our current understanding of the diversity of compensatory mechanisms utilized, the costs and benefits of these responses, and the relative importance of these responses in the wild is still in a nascent stage. For this dissertation, I investigated how juvenile food availability influences adult reproductive decisions and success in Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata). First, I examined whether juvenile compensatory growth has negative consequences for reproduction. I found that juvenile compensatory growth did not affect adult growth rates, litter production rates, or investment in offspring size, but had negative effects on litter size.  Second, I investigated whether individuals during the adult stage can mitigate the negative effects of early setbacks caused by low food availability.  I found that females reared on low food matured at a later age, a smaller size and with less energy reserves than females reared on high food. In response to this setback, they changed their investment in growth, reproduction and fat storage throughout the adult stage such that they were able to catch up in body size, increase their reproductive output and restore their energy reserves to levels comparable to those of females reared on high food. Finally, I explored the relative effects of juvenile versus adult environmental conditions on adult growth strategies in the wild. I found that events occurring during early and later parts of an individual's ontogeny both had important consequences for adult growth strategies, but the direction of their influence differed. Poor conditions during the juvenile stage had a positive effect on adult growth rates, while those same conditions in the recent past and in the present had a negative effect on adult growth.

In 2005, California became the first state to address the  availability of fresh and local produce in the federal School Breakfast  Program through state funding. The California Fresh Start Program  doubled the number of different fresh fruits offered to students. With  the greater variety, the number of fresh fruit servings taken by  students in the Fresh Start pilot program more than doubled.

This new volume of the IARC Handbooks of Cancer Prevention in Tobacco Control presents a critical review and evaluation of the evidence by 25 international experts from twelve countries on the economics, epidemiology, public policy and tobacco control aspects of tax and price policies. The working group draws conclusions about the effectiveness of tax and price measures to control tobacco use in the population. The Handbook covers an overview of tobacco taxation; industry pricing strategies and other industry initiatives diluting the effects of taxes on consumption; tax, price and aggregated demand for tobacco, as well as demand at the individual level in adults, young people and the economically disadvantaged; tax avoidance and tax evasion and the economic and health impacts of tobacco taxation. This body of evidence and the consensus evaluation of 18 concluding statements on the impact of interventions to increase the price of tobacco products, can assist policy makers, government officials, evaluators and researchers working in tobacco control and disease prevention, to base their decisions on the latest scientific evidence.

Natural versus Commercial Carbohydrate Supplementation and Endurance Running Performance
AbstractBackgroundWe examined the metabolic, performance and gastrointestinal (GI) effects of supplementation with a natural food product (raisins) compared to a commercial product (sport chews).MethodsEleven male (29.3&#8201;&#177;&#8201;7.9&#8201;yrs; mean and SD) runners completed three randomized trials (raisins, chews and water only) separated by seven days. Each trial consisted of 80-min (75%VO2max) treadmill running followed by a 5-km time trial (TT). Heart rate (HR), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), blood lactate, serum free fatty acids (FFA), glycerol and insulin, plasma glucose and creatine kinase, GI symptoms and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were recorded every 20-min. We employed a within-subject two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures with a Fisher&#8217;s post hoc analysis to determine significant differences.ResultsVO2, HR, lactate, glycerol and RPE did not differ due to treatment. Average plasma glucose was maintained at resting levels (5.3&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.4&#8201;mmol&#183;L-1) during the sub-maximal exercise bout (5.9&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.6, 5.7&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.6 and 5.5&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.5&#8201;mmol&#183;L-1 for chews, raisins and water respectively), and was significantly higher with chews than water only. RER and % of non-protein macronutrient oxidation derived from carbohydrate was highest with chews, followed by raisins and water was the lowest (74.4&#8201;&#177;&#8201;6.4, 70.0&#8201;&#177;&#8201;7.0 and 65.1&#8201;&#177;&#8201;8.7% for chews, raisins and water respectively) during the sub-maximal exercise period. Serum FFA was higher in the water treatment versus both raisins and chews at 80&#8201;min of sub-maximal exercise. Serum insulin was higher with the chews than both raisins and water (5.1&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2.0, 3.1&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.8, 1.9&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.6 uU&#183;ml-1 for chews, raisins and water respectively). Plasma creatine kinase, corrected for baseline values, for the last 40&#8201;min of the sub-maximal exercise bout, was higher with raisins compared to other treatments. The TT was faster for both carbohydrate supplements (20.6&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2.6, 20.7&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2.5, 21.6&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2.7&#8201;min for raisin, chews and water respectively). GI disturbance was mild for all treatments.ConclusionRaisins and chews promoted higher carbohydrate oxidation and improved running performance compared to water only. Running performance was similar between the raisins and chews, with no significant GI differences.

Premium Gasoline Overbuying in the U.S.: Consumer-Based Choice Analysis
High octane gasolines, including “premium” and midgrade, steadily gained market share in the United States during the 1980s, increasing from 12% of the total gasoline market in 1983 to 15% in 1985 and 30% in 1989. This 18% increase in market share represents an aggregate revenue transfer from U.S. consumers to industry of an additional $3 billion per year.
      It is widely believed that many drivers do not gain any benefit from using premium gasoline. We review the substantial technical evidence underlying this presumption, and then analyze a survey of vehicle owners in New York and California to determine why people purchase premium gasoline, given that many of them receive no clear benefit.
      We found that demand for premium gasoline is highly elastic, women and drivers in certain regions are more inclined to purchase premium gasoline, income plays a minor role, and the benefits are poorly understood. Many people buy premium gasoline for rather vague reasons, not on the basis of strong evidence or justification.

Enhancing the zinc (Zn) in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain is a breeding aim in order to improve human Zn nutrition. This study analyses the temporal dynamics of Zn concentrations in grain tissues during grain filling. On examination of Zn distribution in grains of plants grown at either 1 or 5 mg Zn kg-1 soil, the Zn concentration of the crease was found to increase by 5 to 9 fold between 7 and 34 DAA, while that of the endosperm decreased by 7 to 45%.  Because the Zn turnover rate (d-1) in the crease tissues was either independent of the Zn application level or higher at the lower Zn application level, and the Zn concentration increased with time during grain filling while the turnover rate gradually decreased, it seems that the process of transfer within the grain beyond the grain crease limits the endosperm allocation rather than the input of Zn into the grain. Our data do not allow us to establish whether sink strength for Zn in the endosperm or the Zn transport capacity of the involved membranes is limiting.

Transportation Energy Futures
The search for petroleum alternatives is not new. Ever since the turn of the century, when petroleum became the dominant transportation fuel, authoritative sources have warned occasionally of impending oil shortages (1, 2). When oil prices rose or oil depletion seemed imminent, interest and investments in oil shale, ethanol, coal liquids and gases, and tar sands surged; when oil prices subsided or estimated costs of alternatives escalated, interest and investments in the alternatives waned. Not until recently have several countries actually replaced substantial quantities of petroleum transportation fuels: Canada and South Africa built large production plants to produce gasoline and diesel fuel from tar sands and coal; Brazil replaced most gasoline with ethanol fuel; and New Zealand replaced almost half its gasoline with natural gas-based fuels.

Two groups of occasional smokers : different pathways with the same outcome
Occasional (non-daily) smokers pose difficulties for classic withdrawal-based addiction theory because they can regularly go without cigarettes for days with no apparent discomfort. Occasional smokers can be further divided into two subgroups: (1) occasional smokers who used to smoke daily, also known as former-daily occasional smokers (FDO) and (2) occasional smokers who never smoked daily (NDO). Little is known about the situations under which occasional smokers typically smoke their cigarettes, and even less is known about how daily smokers transition to occasional smoking. Three exploratory studies were conducted to examine the following questions. (1) What proportions of smokers are occasional and daily smokers, and how have the respective proportions changed as social norms become increasingly anti-smoking and as smoking continues to decline? (2) When are occasional smokers most likely to smoke, and how do they compare with daily smokers? (3) How do daily smokers transition to smoking occasionally? When they first cut back to smoking only about half the days in a month, which days are they most likely to forgo? The first study analyzed data from the 1996, 1999, 2002, and 2005 California Tobacco Surveys (CTS); the second used data from the 2002 CTS Young Adult Supplement, which includes questions on smoking situations; and the third focused on 152 occasional smokers recruited from the Internet for detailed interviews on smoking situations. The studies found that occasional smokers represent substantial proportions of all current smokers. Moreover, as the overall smoking prevalence declined from 17.7% in 1996 to 14.2% in 2005, the proportions of occasional smokers did not decrease, as would be predicted by their significantly higher cessation rates compared to that of daily smokers. The proportion of FDO smokers increased, though not significantly, from 1996 to 2005: 12.3% to 14.2% for men and 12.9% to 16.8% for women. The NDO proportion increased from 11.9% to 15.3% for men and decreased slightly from 10.6% to 9.5% for women; but again neither change is statistically significant. The pattern of smoking situations for FDO smokers was quite similar to that of NDO smokers, with greater overall likelihood of smoking in social or episodic situations (i.e., socializing with friends or going out) rather than solitary or routine situations (i.e., working or driving). Both differed significantly from that of daily smokers who tended to smoke across a variety of situations. Most FDO smokers (64.3%) had converted to occasional smoking through quitting smoking completely and then returning to smoking non-daily, rather than by cutting down their consumption gradually. Based on these findings we propose a model explaining how daily smokers could transition to occasional smoking. The minority of daily smokers who cut down gradually to non- daily smoking first forgo those days involving routine, solitary situations, such as at home with no other smokers present. The majority who quit daily smoking and later relapse to occasional smoking restrict their smoking mostly to days that involve episodic social situations, such as at parties. In either case, the results from the present three studies show that FDO smokers are virtually indistinguishable from NDO smokers in their current smoking situations, suggesting their previous smoking pattern has very limited influence on their current smoking behavior

Analyzing the Equity Impacts of Transit Fare Changes: A Case Study of AC Transit
Many transit agencies, faced with budget shortfalls, must consider increasing fares. In this paper we analyze the case of the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District (AC Transit). In March 2005, AC Transit put forth five alternative fare proposals for public discussion. The proposed fare structures included combinations of fare hikes, base fare reductions, eliminations of free transfers, and discontinuation of periodic passes. Using data from the agency’s 2002 on-board survey, we assessed the impacts of the various fare proposals on different subsets of riders and evaluated the equity of each proposal. We also estimated the fare revenues resulting from each proposal, using alternative estimations of price elasticity to estimate changes in ridership due to changes in price. The analysis reveals that fare policies that increase the cost of transfers or eliminate unlimited-use passes produce dramatically unequal impacts on various groups of patrons. Proposals for flat fares per ride were found to be the least equitable of the fare policies, even when the base fare was lowered, because lower income riders, youth, and minorities make more trips and transfer more frequently than their more affluent counterparts. Proposals that maintained existing pass instruments and allowed transfers for small fees were the most favorable. The case study demonstrates the utility of on-board transit survey data in analyzing the effects of proposed fare changes and illustrates an approach that could be used by other transit agencies to evaluate fare options.

Liquid Gold: Breast Milk Banking in the United States
Over the course of the 20th Century, breast milk banks have facilitated the exchange of breast milk from mothers with an excess supply to infants in need. But while early banks used a seller model, purchasing milk as a commodity from lower class women, today banks use a donor model, relying on middle class women who give their milk away as a gift. This dissertation explores why the commodified model of breast milk banking first arose, and why banked breast milk was giftified (but still commodified) by the end of the century. I use content analysis of institutional records from three banks operating in three different eras, and interviews with current milk bank managers, donors, and parents of recipients to address these questions. My analysis indicates that in each era a confluence of factors, in particular women's employment, conceptions of motherhood, medical practices and beliefs, and technologies shapes the exchange of banked breast milk. In the early 20th century new technologies made the physical disembodiment of breast milk possible, while mothering practices and medical authorities' preferences promoted breast milk's symbolic disembodiment, promoting the milk's commodification, while limited employment opportunities created a pool of willing sellers. During the 1960s new mothering practices and related changes in physicians' preferences sacralized the milk, making its sale by mothers culturally inappropriate. Today, high levels of maternal employment and portable, efficient breast pumps create an excess supply of milk that mothers are loath to dispose of due to its sacralized status, sustaining the donor model. But banks still sell the milk as a commodity, albeit a non-profit one, to parents who use the milk both as food and as a form of good parenting in a bottle. Breast milk banking therefore involves both gift and commodity exchange. And as interviews with donors and parents of recipients demonstrate, many middle class donors want to be paid, while middle class parents who purchase the milk reject the idea of donor compensation, pointing to breast milk's ambiguous status even among those intimately involved in its exchange, and the role of social class in mediating actors' perceptions and experiences.

Tracking animals in freshwater with electronic tags: past, present and future
Abstract
				Considerable technical developments over the past half century have enabled widespread application of electronic tags to the study of animals in the wild, including in freshwater environments. We review the constraints associated with freshwater telemetry and biologging and the technical developments relevant to their use. Technical constraints for tracking animals are often influenced by the characteristics of the animals being studied and the environment they inhabit. Collectively, they influence which and how technologies can be used and their relative effectiveness. Although radio telemetry has historically been the most commonly used technology in freshwater, passive integrated transponder (PIT) technology, acoustic telemetry and biologgers are becoming more popular. Most telemetry studies have focused on fish, although an increasing number have focused on other taxa, such as turtles, crustaceans and molluscs. Key technical developments for freshwater systems include: miniaturization of tags for tracking small-size life stages and species, fixed stations and coded tags for tracking large samples of animals over long distances and large temporal scales, inexpensive PIT systems that enable mass tagging to yield population- and community-level relevant sample sizes, incorporation of sensors into electronic tags, validation of tag attachment procedures with a focus on maintaining animal welfare, incorporation of different techniques (for example, genetics, stable isotopes) and peripheral technologies (for example, geographic information systems, hydroacoustics), development of novel analytical techniques, and extensive international collaboration. Innovations are still needed in tag miniaturization, data analysis and visualization, and in tracking animals over larger spatial scales (for example, pelagic areas of lakes) and in challenging environments (for example, large dynamic floodplain systems, under ice). There seems to be a particular need for adapting various global positioning system and satellite tagging approaches to freshwater. Electronic tagging provides a mechanism to collect detailed information from imperilled animals and species that have no direct economic value. Current and future advances will continue to improve our knowledge of the natural history of aquatic animals and ecological processes in freshwater ecosystems while facilitating evidence-based resource management and conservation.

Bipartite and tripartite Cucumber mosaic virus-based vectors for producing the Acidothermus cellulolyticus endo-1,4-beta-glucanase and other proteins in non-transgenic plants
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Using plant viruses to produce desirable proteins in plants allows for using non-transgenic plant hosts and if necessary, the ability to make rapid changes in the virus construct for increased or modified protein product yields. The objective of this work was the development of advanced CMV-based protein production systems to produce Acidothermus cellulolyticus endo-1, 4-&#946;-glucanase (E1) in non-transgenic plants.
				
				
					
						Results
					We used two new Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)-based vector systems for producing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and more importantly, the Acidothermus cellulolyticus endo-1, 4-&#946;-glucanase (E1) in non-transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana plants. These are the inducible CMVin (CMV-based inducible) and the autonomously replicating CMVar (CMV-based advanced replicating) systems. We modified a binary plasmid containing the complete CMV RNA 3 cDNA to facilitate insertion of desired sequences, and to give modifications of the subgenomic mRNA 4 leader sequence yielding several variants. Quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis showed good levels of CMV RNA and coat protein accumulation for some variants of both CMVin and CMVar. When genes for E1 or GFP were inserted in place of the CMV coat protein, both were produced in plants as shown by fluorescence (GFP) and immunoblot analysis. Enzymatic activity assays showed that active E1 was produced in plants with yields up to&#8201;~&#8201;11&#8201;&#956;g/g fresh weight (FW) for specific variant constructs. We also compared in vitro CMV genomic RNA reassortants, and CMV RNA 3 mutants which lacked the C&#8217; terminal 33 amino acids of the 3A movement protein in attempts to further increase E1 yield. Taken together specific variant constructs yielded up to ~21&#8201;&#956;g/g FW of E1 in non-transgenic plants.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Intact, active E1 was rapidly produced in non-transgenic plants by using agroinfiltration with the CMV-based systems. This reduces the time and cost compared to that required to generate transgenic plants and still gives the comparable yields of active E1. Our modifications described here, including manipulating cloning sites for foreign gene introduction, enhance the ease of use. Also, N. benthamiana, which is particularly suitable for agroinfiltration, is a very good plant for transient protein production.

Quantity versus Quality in Off-Street Parking Requirements
Most local governments’ off-street parking requirements promote quantity over quality, focusing on ensuring an ample supply of parking. This has undesirable consequences for the built environment. Parking lots and parking structures routinely overwhelm the architecture and urban design of even the best buildings and neighborhoods. We argue that planners should worry less about the quantity of parking, and pay more attention to its quality. Through examples of zoning reforms adopted by some cities, we show how regulating the quality of parking has the potential to improve urban design.

The Analysis of WRKY70/ LURP1 Dependent Defense Mechanism in Arabidopsis and Tomato
ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATIONThe Analysis of WRKY70/ LURP1 Dependent Defense Mechanism in Arabidopsis and TomatobyAyesha BaigDoctor of Philosophy, Graduate Program in Plant Biology University of California, Riverside, March 2013Dr. Thomas Eulgem, ChairpersonThe Arabidopsis LURP1 gene of LURP gene cluster (Late Up-regulation in Response to Hpa) is a member of a 15-member gene family termed LOR (LURP-one related). Of all Arabidopsis LOR family members, only LURP1 shows an unusually pronounced up-regulation in response to Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa) where as LOR1 shows strong constitutive expression based on microarray data. Reverse genetic studies using transposon insertion mutants revealed an important role of LURP1 in disease resistance mediated by the R-gene RPP5, while LOR1 plays a significant role in basal defense against Hpa. The promoter swap expression lines -1004pLURR1::LOR1 and -1093pLOR1:: LURP1 were constructed  to determine if the promoter or slight differences in their protein sequences are important for the differences in their defense-related roles. Confocal microscopy with stably expressed GFP fusion proteins showed GFP-LURP1 and GFP-LOR1 localized at the plasma membrane and in to the nucleus. Homozygous GFP-LURP1 and GFP-LOR1 restore wild type immunity in the respective mutant backgrounds during compatible and incompatible interaction with Hpa. Yeast two hybrid (Y2H) screens with LURP1 and LOR1 as baits identified no significant interacting partners from a screen of 2.3 x 105 cDNA clones.In Arabidopsis LURP expression is controlled by the WRKY70 transcription factor. Multiple transgenic tomato lines (cultivar VFNT Cherry tomato) containing a Hpa-responsive GUS reporter gene containing a promoter fragment of the LURP member CaBP22 (pCaBP22-333::GUS) ,  responded to the defense inducing chemicals SA, BTH and DCA indicating that the mechanism of LURP regulation is likely conserved between Arabidopsis and tomato. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that WRKY70, which is a single copy gene in Arabidopsis, has two orthologs in tomato termed SlWRKY70a and SlWRKY70b. I made three silencing constructs to individually or co-silence SlWRKY70a and SlWRKY70b. TRV-VIGS silencing construct in homozygous tomato plants containing pCaBP22-333::GUS reporter gene showed that at least one of the two tomato WRKY70 orthologs is required for mediating responses to BTH or DCA defense induction. Thus, the WRKY70/LURP regulatory module is likely conserved between Arabidopsis and tomato.

Who Decides? Mothers' and Children's Beliefs about Food Choices
What do mothers and children believe about whether parents are in charge of what and how much a child should eat? The current study explored children's beliefs about the scope of parental authority over food decisions and whether these beliefs depend on features of the situation. Additionally, relations between children's and their mothers' beliefs were explored.  Mothers and their 5- or 7-year-old children were interviewed separately regarding 4 different types of hypothetical food-related disagreements where a mother requested her child to: eat <bold>healthy</bold> foods, eat <bold>unhealthy</bold> foods, eat foods <bold>equally</bold> healthy to what the child wanted, and eat more or less than the <bold>amount</bold> the child desired. Mothers were also interviewed about actual family disagreements about food and strategies for dealing with them. Results showed that in healthy scenarios mothers and children viewed what children ate as the mothers' decision; however, in all other scenarios mothers viewed what to eat as the child's choice. Children were more likely to see what children ate as up to the parent, only reliably categorizing the unhealthy scenario as the child's choice. Exploring individual differences showed the proportion of mothers' rule-like strategies for real-life food conflicts were correlated with children's authority-based answers. Mothers' political position also predicted children's authority orientation toward food decisions, with children of conservative parents more likely to focus on authority.

Shopping Trips and Spatial Distribution of Food Stores
This is an empirical study of food shopping trips in Seattle, Washington. In travel forecasting models, land use activities and transportation systems are assumed to be in static equilibrium. This paper deals with the dynamic nature of urban systems, specifically the interaction between food retail distribution systems and transportation systems. The research questions were: how long does it take these systems to reach an equilibrium and to what extent do transportation systems respond to location choice of food stores? In this paper, we examined changes in travel distances to and from food stores with respect to the location of food stores. In theory, if stores are optimally located with respect to the market area served, then store size and market size should be in equilibrium. To observe the equilibrating character of retail and transportation systems, actual store location patterns were compared with optimal store location patterns at several points in time using travel distance measures. The study showed that transportation systems and food retail distribution systems adjusted to each other and the process of adjustment took several decades to reach an equilibrium. During the past 50 years, store size and travel distance converged at only one point in time, around 1985. The findings of the study suggest that dynamic-equilibrium based models would provide a better predictive capability for long-term projections than static-equilibrium based models.

Evolutionary diversity of bile salts in reptiles and mammals, including analysis of ancient human and extinct giant ground sloth coprolites
Abstract



Background

Bile salts are the major end-metabolites of cholesterol and are also important in lipid and protein digestion and in influencing the intestinal microflora. We greatly extend prior surveys of bile salt diversity in both reptiles and mammals, including analysis of 8,000 year old human coprolites and coprolites from the extinct Shasta ground sloth (Nothrotherium shastense).



Results

While there is significant variation of bile salts across species, bile salt profiles are generally stable within families and often within orders of reptiles and mammals, and do not directly correlate with differences in diet. The variation of bile salts generally accords with current molecular phylogenies of reptiles and mammals, including more recent groupings of squamate reptiles. For mammals, the most unusual finding was that the Paenungulates (elephants, manatees, and the rock hyrax) have a very different bile salt profile from the Rufous sengi and South American aardvark, two other mammals classified with Paenungulates in the cohort Afrotheria in molecular phylogenies. Analyses of the approximately 8,000 year old human coprolites yielded a bile salt profile very similar to that found in modern human feces. Analysis of the Shasta ground sloth coprolites (approximately 12,000 years old) showed the predominant presence of glycine-conjugated bile acids, similar to analyses of bile and feces of living sloths, in addition to a complex mixture of plant sterols and stanols expected from an herbivorous diet.



Conclusions

The bile salt synthetic pathway has become longer and more complex throughout vertebrate evolution, with some bile salt modifications only found within single groups such as marsupials. Analysis of the evolution of bile salt structures in different species provides a potentially rich model system for the evolution of a complex biochemical pathway in vertebrates. Our results also demonstrate the stability of bile salts in coprolites preserved in arid climates, suggesting that bile salt analysis may have utility in selected paleontological research.

Dependence of groundwater recharge in the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin on climate variability and inter-basin water transfers
The Alameda County Water District (ACWD) supplies water to the cities of Fremont, Newark and Union City. Approximately 40% of this supply requirement is met using water pumped from the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin. Since 1920s, the ACWD has managed recharge operations at Niles Cone and today the water for recharge is obtained from the State Water Project, run off from Alameda Creek Watershed or from direct rain that falls on the Niles Cone region. This paper examines the dependence of recharge operations on precipitation in the Alameda Creek Watershed. Using data from the past 20 years, the paper demonstrates the dependence of Niles Cone Basin on the outlier wet year of 1997-98 to maintain a net positive water balance with respect to levels in 1988-89. Further research using longer time series data of groundwater recharge should be able to provide more evidence of the extent of this dependence on heavy rainfall years to maintain net positive groundwater levels. Such research will be significant in ensuring urban resilience in the context of climate change scenarios we seem to be facing.

Consumption of fructose- but not glucose-sweetened
beverages for 10 weeks increases circulating

4, and gamma-glutamyl transferase activity in
overweight/obese humans
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Prospective studies in humans examining the effects of fructose consumption on biological markers associated with the development of metabolic syndrome are lacking. Therefore we investigated the relative effects of 10 wks of fructose or glucose consumption on plasma uric acid and RBP-4 concentrations, as well as liver enzyme (AST, ALT, and GGT) activities in men and women.
				
				
					
						Methods
					As part of a parallel arm study, older (age 40&#8211;72), overweight and obese male and female subjects (BMI 25&#8211;35&#8201;kg/m2) consumed glucose- or fructose-sweetened beverages providing 25% of energy requirements for 10 wks. Fasting and 24-h blood collections were performed at baseline and following 10 wks of intervention and plasma concentrations of uric acid, RBP-4 and liver enzyme activities were measured.
				
				
					
						Results
					Consumption of fructose, but not glucose, led to significant increases of 24-h uric acid profiles (P&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.0001) and RBP-4 concentrations (P&#8201;=&#8201;0.012), as well as plasma GGT activity (P&#8201;=&#8201;0.04). Fasting plasma uric acid concentrations increased in both groups; however, the response was significantly greater in subjects consuming fructose (P&#8201;=&#8201;0.002 for effect of sugar). Within the fructose group male subjects exhibited larger increases of RBP-4 levels than women (P&#8201;=&#8201;0.024).
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					These findings suggest that consumption of fructose at 25% of energy requirements for 10 wks, compared with isocaloric consumption of glucose, may contribute to the development of components of the metabolic syndrome by increasing circulating uric acid, GGT activity, suggesting alteration of hepatic function, and the production of RBP-4.

Rubber Latex Gloves as a Direct Dosimeter for Measuring Dermal Harvester Pesticide Exposure Particularly With Malathion
Hands are an important route of dermal exposure to agricultural pesticides during strawberry harvesting. Direct dosimeters that trap pesticide residues as they contact workers during harvesting may be valuable sources for estimates of exposure. Latex gloves as hand dosimeters have been evaluated in two settings: 1) commercial strawberry farms, and, 2) controlled studies using a surrogate contact transfer device and malathion-treated turf.	With the assistance of field operators from a commercial strawberry farm, harvester glove samples were collected and obtained via overnight shipping for extraction and analysis of pesticide residues. Harvester gloves accumulated multiple pesticide residues during normal work periods (2 to 2.5 h). Thirteen different pesticide active ingredients were found on harvester gloves at different times. Pesticide residues can accumulate on rubber latex gloves up to ~20 mg/pair by intermittent contact during normal work.	To evaluate the accumulation of surface pesticide residues on light rubber latex gloves, a surrogate model system, the Brinkman Contact Transfer Unit (BCTU), was developed. The BCTU consisted of latex gloves fitted on mannequin hands mounted in a wheeled chassis that could be pushed across a grid of treated turf. Using the BCTU on malathion-treated turf (2 lbs/A), residues accumulated on gloves (0.14-398 µg/glove) over a 13 d study period. Turf residues dissipated biphasically over 13 d and the malathion first-order half-life was 1.4 d. The percent transferred and recovered residue from treated turf to a gloved mannequin hand (assuming 420 cm2 surface area) ranged from <1% to 10% based on measurements of deposition applied to turf. Concurrent applications of malathion and fenpropathrin (data not shown) to turf showed that gloves can accumulate multiple pesticide residues. 	Transferable turf residues (TTRs) were also measured using the CDFA (California) roller and cotton cloth dosimeters. Residues accumulated on cotton cloths ranged from 0.002-0.117 µg /cm2 for days 1 through 13.  When PGRs (µg/glove) were plotted as a function of TTRs (µg/cm2), a strong linear regression correlation was observed (R2= 0.5-1.0) and an empirical transfer factor of 1548 cm2/glove was derived from the slope.

Intake fraction of nonreactive vehicle emissions in US urban areas
Intake fraction, which is the fraction of emissions that are inhaled by people, quantifies the ‘‘exposure efficiency’’ of an emission source. We use three methods to estimate intake fractions for vehicle emissions in US urban areas. First, we use a one-compartment steady-state mass-balance model, incorporating meteorological and demographic data. Second, we use an empirical emissions-to-concentration relationship for vehicle carbon monoxide developed for 15 US urban areas. Third, we analyze model results for benzene and diesel particulate matter from the US Environmental Protection Agency’s National-scale Air Toxics Assessment (NATA). The population-weighted mean intra-urban intake fraction for nonreactive gaseous vehicle emissions in US urban areas is estimated to be in the range 7–21 per million, with a best estimate of 14 per million. The intake fraction for diesel particles is 4 per million, based on NATA results. An intake fraction of 4 per million means that 4mg of pollution are inhaled per kg emitted. Intake fraction values for urban vehicle emissions are usually higher in winter than in summer because of seasonal variability in the atmospheric mixing height. The results presented in this work can be used in health risk assessments, cost–benefit analyses, and other investigations that require a summary of the emission-to-intake relationship.

The High Cost of Flat Fares: An Examination of Ridership Demographics and Fare Policy at the Los Angeles MTA
The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) currently uses a flat fare structure, with several types of special passes, to collect passenger revenues. The fare structure is termed "flat" because each passenger pays the same base fare regardless of time, direction, or distance of travel. This analysis of MTA's ridership demographics shows that this fare structure is neither efficient, effective, nor equitable, though it does offer some operations simplicity. Typically transit dependents -- riders who are more likely poor, non-white, young or old, and female -- maker shorter trips, more non-work trips, and use regular monthly passes less than other comparable passenger groups. As a result, these transit dependent groups, on average, pay relatively more for transit service on a per mile basis, while covering a larger portion of the costs of providing the service, than do choice (or discretionary) riders. This report suggests that switching to a differentiated fare structure, where fares vary by mode, time of day, and/or distance traveled, could improve cost efficiency by more closely matching fares to the actual cost of service provision, increase service effectiveness by increased short distance and off-peak travel, and increase social equity by substantially reducing the cross-subsidy of higher-income riders by lower-income riders.

Social determinants, lived experiences, and consequences of household food insecurity among persons living with HIV/AIDS on the shore of Lake Victoria, Kenya
Food insecurity is a considerable challenge in sub-Saharan Africa, disproportionately affecting persons living with HIV/AIDS. This study investigates the lived experience, determinants, and consequences of food insecurity and hunger among individuals living with HIV/AIDS in Suba District, Kenya. Parallel mixed methods included semi-structured interviews and administration of the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale among a systematic sampling of 67 persons living with HIV/AIDS (49 of whom were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART)). Respondents were eitherseverely (79.1%) or moderately (20.9%) food insecure; no respondents were mildly food insecure or food secure. Qualitative data and simple and multiple linear regression models indicated that significant determinants of food insecurity include increased age, a greater number of children, and not being married. A number of themes related to food insecurity and ART emerged, including (1) an increase in hunger or appetite since initiating ART; (2) exacerbation of ART-related side effects; and (3) non-adherence to ART due to hunger, food insecurity, or agricultural work responsibilities. HIV interventions should address food insecurity and hunger, particularly among at-risk populations, to promote ART adherence and better health outcomes.

Passage Equivalency and Predictive Validity of Oral Reading Fluency Measures
The use of oral reading fluency (ORF) passages within a Response to Intervention (RTI) framework is examined.  Significant limitations within the current ORF research are discussed.  The passage equivalency and readability scores for DIBELS Next, AIMSweb, and a school district's curriculum's ORF passages are evaluated using Generalizability Theory and readability formulas.  Multiple regression is used to analyze the contribution of ORF progress monitoring passages for predicting the California Standards Test (CST).  The optimal number of ORF passages to administer is also examined.   Participants consisted of third and fifth grade students from an urban school district in Southern California.  Results indicate that readability formulas provide wide range of scores for individual passages but rank sets of passages fairly equally.  Results also indicate that ORF passages have high levels of reliability and variance attributable to student skill.  Finally, results also indicate that the addition of progress monitoring did not increase the predictive validity of the CSTs.  The implications, limitations, and future direction of research are discussed.

Height, adiposity and body fat distribution and breast density in young women
Abstract
Introduction
Breast density is one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer, but determinants of breast density in young women remain largely unknown.

Methods
Associations of height, adiposity and body fat distribution with percentage dense breast volume (%DBV) and absolute dense breast volume (ADBV) were evaluated in a cross-sectional study of 174 healthy women, 25 to 29 years old. Adiposity and body fat distribution were measured by anthropometry and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), while %DBV and ADBV were measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Associations were evaluated using linear mixed-effects models. All tests of statistical significance are two-sided.

Results
Height was significantly positively associated with %DBV but not ADBV; for each standard deviation (SD) increase in height, %DBV increased by 18.7% in adjusted models. In contrast, all measures of adiposity and body fat distribution were significantly inversely associated with %DBV; a SD increase in body mass index (BMI), percentage fat mass, waist circumference and the android:gynoid fat mass ratio (A:G ratio) was each associated significantly with a 44.4 to 47.0% decrease in %DBV after adjustment for childhood BMI and other covariates. Although associations were weaker than for %DBV, all measures of adiposity and body fat distribution also were significantly inversely associated with ADBV before adjustment for childhood BMI. After adjustment for childhood BMI, however, only the DXA measures of percentage fat mass and A:G ratio remained significant; a SD increase in each was associated with a 13.8 to 19.6% decrease in ADBV. In mutually adjusted analysis, the percentage fat mass and the A:G ratio remained significantly inversely associated with %DBV, but only the A:G ratio was significantly associated with ADBV; a SD increase in the A:G ratio was associated with an 18.5% decrease in ADBV.

Conclusion
Total adiposity and body fat distribution are independently inversely associated with %DBV, whereas in mutually adjusted analysis only body fat distribution (A:G ratio) remained significantly inversely associated with ADBV in young women. Research is needed to identify biological mechanisms underlying these associations.

The Effects of Transportation Services On the Scale of Food Retailing
Employment centers, residential locations, and home-to-work trips have traditionally been the focus of the urban transportation planning (UTP) process, while shopping and social/recreational trips have been largely neglected. This paper seeks to improve understanding of the relationships between transportation services and other urban activities; specifically, it examines the food retailing industry. How do transportation systems influence the scale economies of food retailing, and how then does food retailing generate new travel demands on shopping trips? We have investigated increases in automobile usage and improvements in urban roads to identify the effects of transportation services on food retailing. By tracing historical data at the national level, we were able to identify changes in transportation and retail activities. The study shows that transportation has a far-reaching effect on food retailing; it has introduced food stores to new technological formats. The reduced number and increased size of food stores suggest that, over time, traffic patterns relating to food shopping are significantly modified.

Il “Regno del Quasi”. Icone cinesi nelle rappresentazioni partenopee di Ermanno Rea e Roberto Saviano
The present article analyzes the use of Chinese icons as a frame for representing Naples in two recent non-fiction novels, "La dismissione" (2002) by Ermanno Rea and "Gomorra" (2006) by Roberto Saviano. Avoiding the pitfalls of identification (as it was trivialized in the 1970s by the political slogan “La Cina è vicina”), the space between China and Naples becomes a geographic metaphor for the many transformations re-shaping the reality of global trade. 
      On the one hand, the reference to China endows Naples with the typical features of post-modern space consumption (Urry 2002), be it in the form of an increasingly immaterial trade or in the more traditional form of tourism. On the other hand, the advent of Chinese firms is at odds with the crisis of steel industry in Naples. Rea describes the whole industrialization of Southern Italy as a fragile utopia, whose failure involves both political and criminal responsibilities: on the contrary, present-day China seems to accomplish the historical processes missed by Naples. However, while the Neapolitan-based heavy industry collapses, the criminal economy of camorra appears to be perfectly “wired” and “on-the-spot”, being connected to the Chinese garment industry and to the global counterfeit market, as both authors highlight in their accounts. 
      By no means an original invention, this spatial metaphor lays its roots in the travel journals from Communist China, such as Franco Fortini's "Asia Maggiore" “Asia Maior” (1956) and Carlo Bernari's "Il gigante Cina" “China, the giant” (1957), two examples of what Paul Hollander has named “political pilgrimages”(1992). Through this metaphor, Fortini emphasizes the misery still affecting both lands in the 1950s, whereas according to Bernari the Chinese “Land of Approximation” is strikingly similar to Naples, a city where power always depends on a series of negotiations. Despite the many continuities with the present, the meaning of this icon is totally reverted in the works by Rea and Saviano, where China embodies a rampant economic power and its morally questionable rules. Finally, the use of this spatial reference represents an implicit statement of “foreignness” and exoticism, since an Orientalist pattern is adopted to place the inner otherness of Naples within the boundaries of a blurred national identity.

Comparative analysis of protein-protein interactions in the defense response of rice and wheat
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Despite the importance of wheat as a major staple crop and the negative impact of diseases on its production worldwide, the genetic mechanisms and gene interactions involved in the resistance response in wheat are still poorly understood. The complete sequence of the rice genome has provided an extremely useful parallel road map for genetic and genomics studies in wheat. The recent construction of a defense response interactome in rice has the potential to further enhance the translation of advances in rice to wheat and other grasses. The objective of this study was to determine the degree of conservation in the protein-protein interactions in the rice and wheat defense response interactomes. As entry points we selected proteins that serve as key regulators of the rice defense response: the RAR1/SGT1/HSP90 protein complex, NPR1, XA21, and XB12 (XA21 interacting protein 12).
				
				
					
						Results
					Using available wheat sequence databases and phylogenetic analyses we identified and cloned the wheat orthologs of these four rice proteins, including recently duplicated paralogs, and their known direct interactors and tested 86 binary protein interactions using yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) assays. All interactions between wheat proteins were further tested using in planta bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). Eighty three percent of the known rice interactions were confirmed when wheat proteins were tested with rice interactors and 76% were confirmed using wheat protein pairs. All interactions in the RAR1/SGT1/ HSP90, NPR1 and XB12 nodes were confirmed for the identified orthologous wheat proteins, whereas only forty four percent of the interactions were confirmed in the interactome node centered on XA21. We hypothesize that this reduction may be associated with a different sub-functionalization history of the multiple duplications that occurred in this gene family after the divergence of the wheat and rice lineages.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					The observed high conservation of interactions between proteins that serve as key regulators of the rice defense response suggests that the existing rice interactome can be used to predict interactions in wheat. Such predictions are less reliable for nodes that have undergone a different history of duplications and sub-functionalization in the two lineages.

[heavy, drinking, drinker, use, adolescent, activation, alcohol, brain, onset, time]

Adolescent alcohol use and fMRI BOLD response : a longitudinal study
Background : Many adolescents engage in heavy alcohol use. From existing literature it is difficult to disentangle whether brain abnormalities are a consequence of heavy drinking, a preexisting risk factor for initiation of alcohol use, or both. Methods: This study uses longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 12 to 16 year-olds (N=40) imaged prior to the onset of drinking, then again approximately three years later after half transitioned to heavy drinking (80 total scans). Heavy drinkers and non-users were matched on baseline and follow-up developmental and risk factors. A repeated measures group x time ANOVA on a priori specified regions of interest was conducted to determine if youth who initiated heavy drinking evidenced a change in activation pattern, as compared to youth who remained non- drinkers. Regions showing divergent activation among initiators of heavy drinking were examined for correspondence with neuropsychological measures of VWM and attention among the heavy drinkers (n=20) in regression analyses. Results : As hypothesized, significant group x time interactions were found in the right inferior parietal lobule (cluster size: 810muL, p=.005; eta²=.23) and left medial frontal gyrus (cluster size: 1431muL, p=.003; eta²=.19). For both interactions, heavy drinkers showed significantly less blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response contrast to high relative to low working memory loads at baseline that increased after the onset of heavy drinking, as compared to controls. Contrary to hypotheses, BOLD response contrast and its change over time were not related to follow-up neuropsychological performance. Discussion: Adolescents who initiated heavy drinking had different brain activation compared to non-drinkers prior to the onset of drinking, suggesting brain activation patterns could be a risk factor for future substance use. Over time, adolescent heavy drinkers exhibited less efficient and mature processing of information. While brain activation did not correlate with behavioral measures, continued heavy use during this important developmental period could compromise neural networks. This investigation helps clarify the effect of alcohol use on brain functioning during adolescence, and aids in understanding whether abnormalities in VWM response among adolescent drinkers follow the initiation of alcohol involvement or predate the onset of drinking

Web-based intervention for alcohol use in women of childbearing potential
There is a need for more effective assessment and primary prevention programs aimed at accurately measuring and reducing alcohol consumption among women before conception in underserved, high-risk populations. Health Information Technology (HIT) may serve this purpose; however, the effectiveness of such tools is not known. We conducted a small-scale randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of an adapted web-based alcohol assessment and intervention tool among low-income, non-pregnant women of reproductive age who were receiving WIC services in San Diego County and who reported currently drinking in a binge pattern. A total of 150 binge-drinking participants completed a web-based assessment and were randomly assigned to either receive a personalized feedback intervention or general health information about alcohol consumption and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Follow-Up assessments on reported alcohol consumption were conducted via telephone at 1- and 2-months post baseline. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 44 and were predominately Hispanic/Latina (44%). At baseline, all respondents reported consuming >̲ 3 standard drinks on >̲ 1 occasion in the previous month. Outcome was available for 131 participants. The main outcome measure was reduction in number of risky drinking occasions, and did not differ significantly between treatment conditions, (OR 1.200, 95% CI 0.567-2.539, p = 0.634). However, over 70% of the participants reported a reduction in risky drinking occasions regardless of treatment condition (Control 43/63, 68%; Experimental 49/68, 72%). Furthermore, after controlling for confounding in a multivariate hierarchical logistic regression model, the estimate of treatment effect reached borderline significance (OR 2.922, 95% CI 0.991-8.613, p = 0.052). The results of the present study demonstrate that web-based assessment of alcohol consumption among low-income women of reproductive age, as represented by WIC clients, is feasible and acceptable. The findings also suggest that detailed and interactive assessments of alcohol consumption may be sufficient for the reduction of risky drinking within this population and personalized feedback may provide additional benefits for some individuals

Studies on Egg Parasitoids of Homalodisca vitripennis (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae): Biology, Sex Ratio Dynamics, and Distribution Across Southern California
Various aspects of the biology, sex ratio allocation, and host specificity of several species of egg parasitoids of the glassy-winged sharpshooter (GWSS), H. vitripennis (Germar), were studied.  The distribution and prevalence of egg parasitoids of GWSS were investigated in an experiment conducted at six field sites over two years.  Most of the observed parasitism was attributed to two species of Gonatocerus, G. ashmeadi Girault  and G. walkerjonesi S. Triapitsyn, with the former producing most of the parasitism in interior southern California and the latter being predominant at coastal sites.  	Biological traits of G. deleoni Triapitsyn, Logarzo & Virla and Pseudoligosita plebeia (Perkins), two potential candidates for biological control of GWSS, were investigated.  Gonatocerus deleoni's average parasitism rate on 1-8-day-old eggs was 45.7% but this was significantly affected by the age of the egg, ranging from 1.4% to 69.9%.  G. deleoni was able to develop in eggs of GWSS and Homalodisca liturata Ball, but was unable to develop on eggs of Graphocephala atropunctata (Signoret) or Erythroneura elegantula Osborn.  When provided honey and water, water alone, or no food or water, P. plebeia adult females lived an average of 64.1, 2.3, and 2.0 days, respectively.  Pseudoligosita plebeia were able to successfully parasitize GWSS eggs (1-8 days old), with higher parasitism in young host eggs (1-3 days old) than in old host eggs (5-7 days old).  An increasing trend in offspring production was seen for P. plebeia from adult age 2 to 26 days followed by a decreasing trend with offspring produced up to age 75.  Pseudoligosita plebeia contained fewer mature eggs at younger ages (1 and 3 days old) than at older ages (5, 11, 15, and 31 days old).	We examined whether G. ashmeadi Girault produces precise sex ratios under a field setting.  Our analyses show field collected G. ashmeadi tend to produce less female biased sex ratios with higher variance in male numbers than are shown in laboratory studies.  We found significant effects of proportion parasitism and host density on sex ratio, while proportion parasitism had a significant effect on sex ratio variance.

Prenatal alcohol exposure pattern and timing and minor structural malformations and growth deficiencies
Prenatal exposure to alcohol is associated with a spectrum of abnormalities, referred to as the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Alcohol measurement issues have created many challenges in understanding the patterns of alcohol exposure that result in FASD. Knowledge about prenatal alcohol volume and timing of exposure in relationship to fetal outcomes improves our understanding of the magnitude of risk with various patterns of drinking. Using data on 992 subjects collected prospectively in California between 1978 and 2005, we examined the patterns and timing of alcohol exposure in relation to the characteristic features of FAS and to minor structural malformations that occurred in at least five percent of the sample that were not previously established as the characteristic features of FAS. A dysmorphologist performed a blinded physical examination of each infant for the presence or absence of minor structural malformations using a standard checklist of 132 minor malformations. In addition to the minor malformations, a number of anthropometric parameters were measured. Patterns of drinking were evaluated by drinks per day, number of binge episodes, and maximum number of drinks. Timing of exposure was evaluated 0-6 weeks post- conception, 6-12 weeks post-conception, second trimester, and third trimester. Logistic and poisson regression models were developed to test both hypotheses. Reduced birth length and weight, microcephaly, smooth philtrum, thin vermillion border, and naevus flammeus neonatorum are associated with specific gestational timing of prenatal alcohol exposure and are dose-related without evidence of a threshold. Additionally, poisson regression models of the alcohol-related outcomes showed that during the first two trimesters, as the number of drinks per day on average increased and the number of binge episodes increased, the number of alcohol-related birth outcomes significantly increased (p's<0.001). As the maximum number of drinks in one occasion increased throughout pregnancy, the number of outcomes also significantly increased (p's<0.01). There is no safe threshold for alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Based on the results of this study, pregnant women should continue to abstain from alcohol consumption. Additionally, women who are of childbearing age and who are contemplating or at risk of becoming pregnant should be encouraged to avoid drinking

Influence of nitrogen rate on micronutrient density in grain of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)
Agricultural approaches are suggested to increase micronutrients in cereal grain and then to alleviate human malnutrition. A long-term (1999-2007) field experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of three nitrogen (N) fertilization rates (0, 130 and 300 kg N/ha) on micronutrient density in wheat grain and its milling fractions. There were three N rates in this trail: 0, 130 and 300 kg N/ha. At maturity, grains were harvested and fractionated into flour, shorts and bran for micronutrients, N and protein analysis. The results showed that N fertilization increased iron (Fe), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) density in wheat grain compared to the control. Increase of N application rate from 130 to 300 kg N/ha, however, didn't further increase the three micronutrient density in grain. Most micronutrients were accumulated in bran while the lowest micronutrient concentrations were found in the flour. High N application increased Zn and Cu densities in three fractions while for Fe, its density in shorts and bran were increased, not in flour. Manganese (Mn) concentration in grain was not influenced by N application. It is concluded that nitrogen plays an important role in micronutrient accumulation in wheat grain. Proper nitrogen fertilizer management has a potential to enhance both micronutrients and grain protein.

Bioactive and bioresponsive nanoparticle surface modifications for vaccine and systemic drug delivery
Nanomedicine is a research field that has recently made significant progress in the areas of drug delivery. A drug delivery vehicle must be able to carry a therapeutic cargo and be able to reach the target tissue and the intended intracellular target or compartment. This dissertation will focus on two major applications of drug delivery vehicles and novel improvements in these areas. The first area is vaccine delivery, where sensitive biological cargo must be delivered to and activate immune cells. A new peptide adjuvant called Hp91 was chosen to be co-delivered to dendritic cells along with an antigen to ensure activation. The vaccine drug delivery vehicle designed to deliver these biomolecules consists of a poly(lactic-co- glycolic acid) (PLGA) core with the antigen encapsulated inside and the peptide adjuvant either co-encapsulated or conjugated to the outside. The PLGA successfully protected the protein and peptide from degradation, maintaining its activity. The vaccine delivery vehicles showed a marked improvement over free Hp91 in both human and mouse dendritic cell activation, with a maximum of 44 fold increase in IL-6 stimulation when the peptide was conjugated to the surface. The second area of research presented here is systemic drug delivery. For systemic delivery, long circulation is a desirable characteristic and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is the current state of the art. However, PEG presents two challenges: 1. PEG can hinder the nanoparticle from entering the cytosol across the endosomal or cellular membrane, and 2. PEG can sometimes induce immunogenicity resulting in accelerated blood clearance after repeated dosing. A novel PEG shedding nanoparticle is presented as a solution to the first challenge. The ability to shed the PEG layer in response to a reduction in pH allows a fusogenic lipid layer to be exposed, which promotes membrane disruption. For patients who respond immunogenically to PEG, a biomimetic apolipoprotein coating to replace PEG altogether is presented. Apolipoprotein A1 is shown here to stabilize PLGA nanoparticles and increase their circulation half-life beyond that of the traditional PEG coating. These drug delivery vehicles were engineered from the foundation of a biodegradable, biocompatible PLGA polymer core with characteristic surface properties designed to overcome these specific challenges to drug delivery

Addressing Water Consumption of Evaporative Coolers with Greywater
Evaporative coolers (ECs) provide significant gains in energy efficiency compared to vapor compression air conditioners, but simultaneously have significant onsite water demand. This can be a major barrier to deployment in areas of the world with hot and arid climates. To address this concern, this study determined where in the world evaporative cooling is suitable, the water consumption of ECs in these cities, and the potential that greywater can be used reduce the consumption of potable water in ECs. ECs covered 69percent of the cities where room air conditioners are may be deployed, based on comfort conditions alone. The average water consumption due to ECs was found to be 400 L/household/day in the United States and Australia, with the potential for greywater to provide 50percent this amount. In the rest of the world, the average water consumption was 250 L/household/day, with the potential for greywater to supply 80percent of this amount. Home size was the main factor that contributed to this difference. In the Mediterranean, the Middle East, Northern India, and the Midwestern and Southwestern United States alkalinity levels are high and water used for bleeding will likely contribute significantly to EC water consumption. 
Although technically feasible, upfront costs for household GW systems are currently high. In both developed and developing parts of the world, however, a direct EC and GW system is cost competitive with conventional vapor compression air conditioners. Moreover, in regions of the world that face problems of water scarcity the benefits can substantially outweigh the costs.

					Here we describe an 8&#8201;month old Yorkshire terrier that presented with episodes of hyperactivity and aggressive behavior. Between episodes, the dog&#8217;s behavior and neurologic examinations were normal. A T2 weighted MRI of the brain showed diffuse grey matter hyperintensity and a urine metabolite screen showed elevated 2-hydroxyglutaric acid. We sequenced all 10 exons and intron-exon borders of L2HGDH from the affected dog and identified a homozygous A to G transition in the initiator methionine codon. The first inframe methionine is at p.M183 which is past the mitochondrial targeting domain of the protein. Initiation of translation at p.M183 would encode an N-terminal truncated protein unlikely to be functional.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					We have identified a mutation in the initiation codon of L2HGDH that is likely to result in a non-functional gene. The Yorkshire terrier could serve as an animal model to understand the pathogenesis of L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria and to evaluate potential therapies.

Essays in Schooling, Nutrition and Public Policy
This thesis examines human capital outcomes in developing countries. It is especially concerned with evaluating the policies meant to raise the rate of accumulation of such capital in poor households.Chapter 3 considers this problem in the context of calorie deprivation in India. Rapid economic growth has been advocated as the instrument of choice in tackling undernutrition in India. Yet, while India's annual economic growth has never dipped below four percent in two decades, calorie consumption has been falling across the income distribution. This poses a disturbing trend against the background of widespread malnutrition.Chapter 2 details how the literature has typically defined nutrition, and attempted to derive the causal impact of income on it. The next essay investigates the calorie-income puzzle using a random sample of poor households in rural Maharashtra from the 2004 National Sample Survey. The nonparametric estimate of the expenditure elasticities of calories reveals that there is a gradual fall from 0.28 to zero over the income distribution, which roughly translates to a halving of the elasticities from 1983. Controlling for household and district level characteristics does not alter the basic estimate. It closes by showing that food price inflation could not have been the cause of the calorie decline.Chapter 4 examines the intergenerational transmission of schooling in Zimbabwe. After Independence in 1980, Zimbabwe implemented a substantial reform of the racially-segregated education system it inherited from colonial times. A key element of the reform was the elimination of restrictions governing progress from primary to secondary school. Consequently, primary school graduates of 1980 entered secondary school at a rate three times higher than the class of 1979. Exploiting the fuzzy discontinuity implicit in this natural experiment, I find that an additional year of schooling acquired by a woman increased her child's by about five percent of a standard deviation. Estimates of schooling transmitted from fathers to children were thrice as large, significant and robust. Descriptive evidence suggests that public investment in the quality of schooling would have enhanced the intergenerational benefits of the reform.

Startle-Freeze Behavior in Weaned Pigs
Pigs may express a startle response and then freeze after they have heard 
      an auditory stimulus. The objective of this study was to induce startle-freeze behaviour,
         describe it and to seek potential variables that might influence it. A startle-freeze 
         response lasting 1 to 12 seconds was produced in 36 pigs 5-6 weeks old penned in 12 
         groups (3 pigs per group), using a cymbal (26 cm radius) to produce a sound of 1 10 dB 
         intensity. This was repeated at 4 minute intervals for 8 stimuli over 28 minutes. The 
         duration of the startle-freeze response decreased over presentations and all pigs had 
         ceased to respond by the seventh stimulus. The frequencies of social interaction, 
         ingestion and lying or sitting behaviours before freezing decreased after the freeze 
         period, and standing or walking increased. The behaviours shown before and after 
         immobilisation were not independent (x\ = 101.9, p < 0.001). The social status of each 
         group was determined from videotape records. The dominance rank of the pig was 
         significantly related to the onset of immobilization; the most dominant pigs responded to 
         the noise first, often 1 to 2 seconds ahead of lower ranked pigs (x\ = 15.74, p < 0.05). 
         In conclusion, pigs show a clear startle-freeze response to a novel auditory stimulus, they 
         habituate rapidly and the onset of startle-freeze behaviour depends upon their social 
         status.

Excerpt from Zoot Suit: The Enigmatic Career of an Extreme Style
Kathy Peiss knocks the established literature akilter in her study of the zoot suit. This flashy, over-the-top garb of the 1940s has long been studied as a uniform of hipsters and pachucos in the United States, who were targeted for violent repression by white police and servicemen in the 1943 “Zoot Suit Riots” in Los Angeles. Peiss audaciously opens up her study to discuss the signifier of the zoot suit internationally. In a tour de force, she outlines the sense of cultural identity fostered among zoot suiters and allied long-coat wearers, as well as the political meanings assigned to them, in such diverse places as Mexico, Trinidad, South Africa, and the USSR during the 1940s.

Stimulation with a class A CpG oligonucleotide enhances resistance to infection with feline viruses from five different families
Abstract
				
				Domestic cats are commonly affected by viral pathogens that induce lengthy infections with fatal outcomes. Prevention of viral propagation is of primordial importance in shelters and catteries, where cats from different backgrounds have narrow contacts. Oligonucleotides (ODN) containing cytosine-phosphate-guanosine motifs of class A (CpG-A) are highly potent synthetic inducers of innate antiviral mechanisms. The aim of this study was to test their ability to modulate innate immune responses and prevent viral replication as stand-alone agents in the domestic cat. CpG-A stimulation of feline peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) enhanced their proliferation, increased the presence of co-stimulatory molecules on their surface and influenced their gene expression profiles in an antiviral orientation. Incubation of the supernatants of CpG-A stimulated PBMCs with feline cell lines of epithelial and fibroblastic origin induced expression of the antiviral myxovirus resistance (Mx) gene in these target cells, which also showed enhanced resistance to feline viruses from five distinct families, namely Coronaviridae, Herpesviridae, Caliciviridae, Parvoviridae, and Retroviridae. Most importantly, subcutaneous administration of CpG-A in domestic cats systemically increased the expression of Mx, reaching maximal levels within 24 h. Plasma from treated cats could furthermore inhibit viral replication in vitro. Altogether, our data highlight the promising potential of CpG-A to induce a preventive antiviral state in the cat and to protect feline populations against a broad range of virus infections.

Use of an Egocentric Frame of Reference by Gouped Fish (Aphyocharax erithrurus) in a Spatial Discrmination
Small groups offish of a schooling species (Aphyocharax erithrurus) were trained to turn right or left in order to avoid being temporarily swept out of the water.This was achieved by a rotating avoidance paddle approaching them with one door (right or left) open. Once a learning criterion was attained, the direction of the paddle was reversed and both doors were opened. During these inversion trials, fish chose the door which was at the same side in relation to their body, showing that egocentric clues were used when facing the problem from an opposite viewpoint. When rtical black and white stripes were present at one side of the tank, a different response appeared during the inversion trials: fish passed through the door nearest to the stripes regardless of which door was open during training. It is concluded that these fish use  egocentric references when the spatial problem is reversed by 180°, and that this response is overridden by a tendency to swim near a vertically striped background.

The City Feeds the Poor:  The Struggle for Sustainable Food Systems in San Francisco
ABSTRACTThe literature on public procurement, sustainable development and school food is growing as many look to improve the economicviability of small and medium sized farms by expanding their market opportunities to include public food service operations.    Because of their place in public bureaucracies, many advocates look to school food procurement as a domain they may rightly claim.  However, many lack an understanding of the complexity of the school meal system, as well as the role of local school meal programs in communities as anti hunger programs, child wellness initiatives, and employment for communities. There is also a lack of understanding of the structural opportunities and barriers within local school meal programs that either inhibit or advance local procurement of regionally produced agricultural. The in-depth case study of San Francisco school meals exposes the impact of federal and state policy and funding changes to a local educational system, and also reveals the role of organizational history and structure as an important actor in the project to rebuild public school food systems to serve growing children, and advance markets for regional small and midsized farmers.

Assessment of Food Web Recovery from Fish Introductions and Trophic Structure in Lakes of the Sierra Nevada, California Using Stable Isotopes
Stocking of salmonid fish in naturally fishless Sierra Nevada lakes over the last century has had a profound impact on aquatic foodwebs. Current research has focused on removal of fish from several lakes to observe recovery of zooplankton, benthic invertebrates and, in particular, the endangered southern mountain yellow-legged frog (Rana muscosa). Biological samples from two currently fish containing lakes and two lakes where fish have been removed were collected over the last 15 years to determine recovery rates of species found in the lakes. Due to the remote location of the lakes, the samples were preserved with ethanol (EtOH) for later analysis. However, long-term preservation methods can have significant impacts on the &#948;13C values of stable isotopes by resulting in enrichment in isotope values. I developed a rinse method to remove EtOH from the archived samples and to reduce the impact preservatives on stable isotopeanalysis. After removing the preservative, samples were rinsed for. The rinsing method resulted in enrichment of 13C suggesting a much shorter rinsing time (< 1 day) as well as species-specific corrections for &#948;13C content were required to improve the accuracy of stable isotope analysis of preserved samples.	I examined the trophic structure of lakes containing and lacking fish using carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes. &#948;15N values revealed distinct trophic fractionation values for each type of lake. Trophic fractionation for fish-containing and fish-removed lakes was 2.03 / ± 0.517 (n=116) and1.76 / ± 0.384 (n=186) respectively. Nitrogen values in fish-containing lakes species tended to be enriched relative to fish-removed lakes, suggesting increased P availability.  Time-series of &#948;15N for multiple species indicated small variations in nitrogen suggesting changes in diet from year to year. However significant depletion of 4.42 / was noted for the copepod Leptodiaptomus signicauda and correlated with the reemergence of Daphnia melanica post fish removal. Computations of trophic position indicated that frogs and fish occupy the same trophic level and likely rely on the same food sources. This finding suggests that fish cause extirpation of frogs both through direct predation and competition for food resources.

Agronomic approaches in biofortification of food crops with micronutrients
Zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) deficiencies are well-documented public health issue affecting nearly half of the world population.  Developing countries are among the worst affected from Zn and Fe deficiencies which result in number of serious health complications, such as impairments in brain function and mental development, high susceptibility to deadly infectious disease and high risk for anemia.  Recent reports indicate that, for example, Zn deficiency is responsible for death of nearly 450 000 children under 5-years old, annually. Very low concentrations and poor bioavailability of Zn and Fe in the commonly consumed foods seem to be the main reason for widespread occurrence of micronutrient deficiencies in human populations. Cereal-based foods are most commonly consumed foods and contribute up to 75 % of the daily calorie intake in the rural parts of the developing countries. Zinc and Fe deficiencies are also common micronutrient deficiencies in agricultural soils limiting both crop production and nutritional quality
      Breeding new cereal genotypes with high genetic capacity for grain accumulation of micronutrients is widely accepted and most sustainable solution to the problem. There are impressive progresses in breeding new genotypes for high micronutrient density. However, the breeding approach is a long-term process and may be affected from very low chemical solubility of Zn and Fe in soils due to high pH and low organic matter. Agronomy-related approaches offer short-term and complementary solutions to the Zn and Fe deficiency in human health and crop production. Soil amendments contributing to solubility of Zn and Fe in soil solution, cereal-legume intercropping systems, and soil and foliar application of micronutrient-containing fertilizers are well-documented agronomic tools which contribute to root uptake, shoot and grain accumulation of Fe and Zn.
      Fertilizer strategy is a simple and effective agronomic practice to contribute grain concentrations of micronutrients. Increasing number of evidence is available showing that soil and especially foliar application of Zn fertilizers results in impressive enhancements in grain Zn concentration. In contrast, soil and foliar application of Fe fertilizers is not effective in increasing grain Fe concentration.  In wheat, foliar application of ZnSO4 at later growth stages seems to be more effective in enhancing grain Zn concentration than the application at earlier growth stages. Late foliar application of Zn is also effective in higher accumulation of Zn in the endosperm part of grains compared to earlier application. Enrichment of commonly soil-applied fertilizers like urea with Zn seems to be also very helpful strategy in improving grain Zn concentration. Recently published results indicate that soil and/or foliar application of nitrogen fertilizers improve both root uptake and grain accumulation of Fe and Zn.
      The results available indicate high potential of agronomic approaches for improving grain Zn and Fe concentrations. Agronomic practices mentioned are simple and easily applicable in many target countries with high incidence of micronutrient deficiencies. Combination of agronomic practices with breeding approach will ensure the plants to maximize grain accumulation of micronutrients.  This paper will also summarize the results of a recently initiated global zinc fertilizer project in 10 countries under HarvestPlus program (www.harvestzinc.org).

Management Strategies for the Potato Psyllid in California
The potato/tomato psyllid, <italic>Bactericera cockerelli</italic> (Sulc) (Hemiptera: Triozidae) is a major pest of solanaceous crops. This pest causes yield loss by direct feeding on crop plants and by transmitting a bacterial pathogen known as <italic>Candidatus</italic> Liberibacter psyllaurous (a. k. a. <italic>Ca.</italic> L. solanacearum). The goal of my research is to improve pest management against this pest in potatoes by integrating sampling, insecticides, use of resistant varieties, and biological control.	Sampling plans are essential part of integrated pest management (IPM). From my research on potatoes, I determined the most efficient sampling unit, and that this pest has an aggregated distribution in the field. Binomial sequential sampling plans were developed for the potato psyllid. Current pest management practices in the USA rely on the intensive use of broad-spectrum insecticides to control the potato psyllid to lower disease incidences and increase yields. I evaluated five insecticides in the laboratory. All insecticides tested significantly reduced probing durations and increased the amount of time adult psyllids spent off the leaflets compared to untreated controls suggesting that these chemicals may be deterrents to feeding as well as repellents. Additionally, I further tested the effects of imidacloprid on potato psyllid feeding behavior using a direct current electrical penetration graph technique.	Host plant resistance can be an integral component of an integrated approach for the management of arthropod pests. I tested the effects of potato germplasm from 22 genotypes on adult potato psyllid behavioral responses for possible antixenosis and determined if specific breeding clones or varieties can decrease transmission of <italic>Ca. L. psyllaurous</italic>. Another assessment that should be made in an IPM program is the potential role of natural enemies in controlling pests. Through two years of field studies (2009-2010) at four different sites and laboratory feeding tests, I have identified <italic>Orius tristicolor</italic> (White) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae), <italic>Geocoris pallens</italic> Stal (Hemiptera: Geocoridae), <italic>Hippodamia convergens</italic> Guerin-Meneville (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), and the parasitoid <italic>Tamarixia triozae</italic> (Burks) (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) as key natural enemies of the potato psyllid in southern California potatoes, tomatoes, and bell peppers. I discuss how this information can be used in an integrated pest management program for the potato psyllid.

Faces of Weight Polytopes, a Generalization of a Theorem of Vinberg and Koszul Algebras
Let $\g$ be a reductive Lie algebra over $\C$ and let $V$ be a $\g$-semisimple module. In this article, we study the category $\ghat$ of $\Z_+$-graded $\g\ltimes V$-modules with finite-dimensional grade pieces. We construct and classify certain special subsets called {\it weak $\F$-faces} of the set of weights of $V$. If $V$ is a generalized Verma module, our result allows us to recover and extend a result due to Vinberg on the classification of faces of the weight polytope.If $\g$ is semisimple and $V$ is simple, we use the {\it positive} weak $\F$-faces of the set of weights of $V$ to construct a large family of Koszul algebras which have finite global dimension. We are also able to construct truncated subcategories of $\ghat$ which are directed and highest weight.

Weight loss success among overweight children : what predicts short-term outcome?
Epidemic increases in obesity in the United States have focused research attention on prevention and treatment issues. Rates of obesity have steadily increase over the past 20 years. Adult and child obesity rates have both increased. The percentage of children at risk for overweight (at or above the 85th percentile body mass index for age) increased significantly from 28.2% to 33.6% between 1999 and 2004. One out of every three children in the United States is overweight or obese. Much effort is now focused on prevention of obesity. However, varied results have been demonstrated. Data analyzed as part of this dissertation were collected during a pediatric obesity treatment trial ("Childhood Obesity Treatment: A Maintenance Approach") funded by a five-year grant from the National Institute for Child and Human Health Development. Over a three year period (three fall cohorts), overweight children (aged 7-12 years), along with one obese parent were invited and agreed to participate in the 20-week weight loss phase of the Family Weight Control and Prevention Program in San Diego, California. This study sought to examine predictors of short term weight loss or stabilization among overweight children enrolled in this family-based behavioral intervention. Offered is an examination of areas to be considered when designing a weight loss intervention program and evaluating what components to maintain as part of an overall program while attempting to reduce participant burden. First evaluated was whether demographic variables affected outcome in an intervention targeting overweight children. Race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status were not found to have a differential effect on the amount of weight lost or self- efficacy. This suggests that intervention strategies don't always need to be tailored to race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status. Next evaluated was dietary self- monitoring. As found previously among adults and adolescents, preadolescent children who completed journals on a more consistent basis, lost more weight comparatively. Additionally, any self monitoring was beneficial for weight loss when compared to those who did not journal. Finally, we demonstrated that physical activity self-efficacy is an important variable to consider in the planning of exercise programs that are components of weight loss interventions

Food Restriction and Sperm Number in the Water Strider Aquarius remigis.
Male <italic>Aquarius remigis</italic> (Hemiptera: Gerridae), produce giant sperm with an unusual morphology:  unlike most animal sperm, in which the length of the tail far exceeds that of the head, the heads and tails of <italic>A. remigis</italic> sperm are approximately equal in length.  The acrosome of <italic>A. remigis</italic> sperm contains a matrix rich in flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), a riboflavin-containing molecule.   Previous studies have shown that giant sperm are costly to produce, leading to a trade-off between sperm size and number. Furthermore, insects are unable to synthesize riboflavin and must obtain it through their diet; given their FAD-rich sperm, <italic>A. remigis</italic> males likely require large amounts of dietary riboflavin for sperm production.  Thus, given their large, costly, nutrient-rich gametes, I hypothesized that male <italic>A. remigis</italic> would respond to food restriction with a decrease in sperm number. Here, I tested the hypothesis that sperm number, and hence male fertility, is limited by food availability in <italic>A. remigis</italic> with a series of four studies examining (1) sperm numbers and egg fertility in wild males and females in natural populations, (2) the effect of food restriction on sperm number and mating behavior in wild-caught males, (3) the effect of food restriction on sperm number and mating behavior in lab-reared males, and (4) long-term sperm storage in females.I found that males and females in natural populations often contain few or no sperm, and the fitness of both sexes may, at times, be limited by sperm supplies. Food restriction had a drastic effect on sperm numbers in wild males, with fed males containing much more sperm than unfed males. Mating behavior was also subject to the effects of food restriction, with fed males mating more frequently than unfed males. No such effect of food restriction was seen on sperm numbers or mating behavior in males reared in the laboratory with abundant food. Finally, I found that viable sperm can be stored in the female reproductive tract for at least seven weeks, which is even longer than previously known.

Odour Preferences and Discrimination in Captive Ringtail Possums (Pseudocheirus peregrinus)
Olfactory communication has been shown to be important in marsupials and, specifically, in Trichosurus vulpecula and Petaurus breviceps. Despite its commonality, little is known about the communication in the ringtail possum, Pseudocheirus peregrines. Therefore, to investigate olfactory communication in the ringtail possum, two experiments were conducted. The odour preference experiment examined the importance of fur, salivary, faecal and urinary odours in ringtail possum olfactory communication. The latency to approach urinary odours was significantly longer than for any other odours. Males sniffed familiar female urine samples for a significantly shorter duration than any other odour samples. Fur samples were manipulated for longer durations than any other odour samples. The discrimination experiment examined the ability of ringtail possums to discriminate between urine samples, and hence obtain socially significant information from such odour sources. The ringtail possums showed that they were able to discriminate between individuals and between sexes. The possible functions of urine, fur and paracloacal gland secretions are discussed.

Comparison of Prehospital Glucose with or without IV Thiamine
Introduction: Loading of thiamine prior to glucose administration during hypoglycemia to prevent Wernicke’s encephalopathy is routine in the prehospital setting. To date no study has looked at the validity of this therapy.
      Methods: We evaluated a retrospective cohort of 242 patients who received intravenous glucose for hypoglycemia comparing those who received thiamine supplementation versus those who did not. Study endpoints were heart rate, blood pressure, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), reentry into the 911 system, and emergency department (ED) discharge rates.
      Results: There were no significant differences between the thiamine, and without-thiamine groups. All patients were discharged neurologically intact or were alert and oriented when refusing transport to the hospital. None of the 242 patients re-called 911 within the immediate 24-hour period or returned to the ED.
      Conclusion: To our knowledge this is the first study in the literature which evaluated the use of thiamine with glucose to prevent Wernicke’s encephalopathy in the prehospital setting. We found that routine administration of thiamine with glucose did not result in differences in respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, GCS or ED hospital discharge rates. Until further research is done to validate our results emergency medical services leadership should consider whether the routine use of thiamine in the prehospital setting is appropriate for their system.

Gender Differences in Marmosets and Tamarins:  Responses to Food Tasks
The study of behavioural gender differences among Callitrichid primates 
      has been generally neglected. We describe evidence from experimental studies in 
      which adult female tamarins (Saguinus) and marmosets (Callithrix) demonstrate priority 
      of access to food that is spatially and temporarily restricted. Differences in behavioural 
      strategies between both reproductive and non-reproductive females, and males, are 
      consistent with differences between the genera in their feeding ecology and social 
      organisation. They are also functionally plausible. A recent study gives preliminary 
      data to show that, although mated females in family groups of common marmosets 
      demonstrate priority of access to food sources, overall there are differences in 
      responsiveness that may be influenced by factors such as the time of feeding, energy 
      content and preference of food.

Regulation of nitrogen nutrition at the whole tree level: biotic interactions in the rhizosphere of European beech forests
Despite high N requirements for growth and development, many forest trees have developed at sites with low N availability that are characterized by a largely closed ecosystem N cycle. Under such conditions trees have to compete with other organisms for the limited amount of N present. The competitors include the soil microflora, the natural regeneration, other understorey species, as well as competing tree species. In this contribution mechanisms of these competitive interactions are discussed in beech-dominated, deciduous forests that constitute the potential natural vegetation of Central Europe.

The CAFE Standards Worked
Cars manufactured in the United States have become increasingly fuel efficient in the past two decades, and many people attribute that to rising gasoline prices. From 1975 to 1985, following the 1973 oil embargo, the fuel efficiency of new cars increased by more than 60 percent. What's surprising, however, is that fuel efficiency continued to remain high even when gasoline prices declined, even falling below prices in 1970. Why didn't we see a return of the gas guzzlers?

Investigating fatty acid biosynthesis within the algal chloroplast using Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as a model
As finite petroleum reserves run their course and combustion-related CO₂ emissions rise concerns about global warming, humanity is faced with the challenge of finding new sources of energy that are carbon-neutral, renewable and sustainable to meet the growing demand. Photosynthetic organisms convert solar energy and CO₂ directly into metabolic products that can serve as fungible biofuels. Microalgae are particularly attractive as a biodiesel feedstock, as they produce oil in high yields, grow at fast rates in habitats not suitable for conventional agriculture, and do not compete with the food supply. However, oil accumulation occurs under environmental stress, which compromises biomass productivity, and algal fatty acids are not ideal for biodiesel quality. The ability to manipulate algal fatty acid biosynthesis would thus be a significant stride towards developing algae as a biodiesel feedstock. In fatty acid biosynthesis within an algal chloroplast, an acyl carrier protein (ACP) tethers the growing fatty acid as it undergoes iterative cycles of elongation, and a thioesterase (TE) domain catalyzes the release of a mature fatty acid from the ACP. As plant TEs specific for certain chain length fatty acids have altered the fatty acid profile of transgenic plants and bacteria, this has emerged as a promising strategy to modify algal fatty acid content to fashion an optimized biodiesel feedstock. The work outlined in this thesis aims to investigate intermolecular interactions in algal fatty acid biosynthesis to facilitate engineering. A novel strategy was employed in which a chemical probe inspired by the enzymatic activity of the algal TE was synthesized, attached to the algal ACP chemoenzymatically, and used to trap algal ACP-TE interactions in vitro. No protein- protein interactions were detected between plant TEs and the algal ACP in vitro, and thus plant TEs did not elicit the desired phenotype when engineered into the algal chloroplast. Using protein-protein interactions as a means to control product identity may shift the paradigm towards rationally designed engineering approaches to optimize algae as a bioenergy source. Renewable energy outreach and education has been an indispensable facet of this work to generate awareness and instill passion for sustainable energy in our future scientists

[euphausiid, food, water, fish, palp, sea, diet, part, mandible, animal]

Euphausiacea (Crustacea) of the North Pacific
As a part of the Marine Life Research Program of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (a member of the California Coöperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations) an increased effort is being made to describe and evaluate the various organic factors that are important in the biological economy of the sea. In attacking the problem, the most expedient procedure is to study in detail the various components of the plankton, for it is well known that these components in varying degrees of importance provide directly the basic food for the plankton-feeding fishes, such as the sardine, and also directly or indirectly for larger but less abundant pelagic fishes, as well as benthonic life. Among the several groups of zoöplankton organisms that are being studied are the euphausiid shrimp. These highly pelagic crustaceans, popularly known as “krill,” occur in large swarms in all oceans in both neritic and oceanic waters. They are considered second in importance only to the copepods as basic animal food in the sea but often exceed the copepods in mass and numbers, especially at greater depths. The present report deals with the group taxonomically on a wide geographic basis. The chief purpose here is to provide an essential tool with complete descriptions and illustrations to facilitate further study of the biology of the euphausiids and their relation to the pelagic community of the Pacific. Such a study is now under way, and it is believed that application of knowledge of the various species, their geographic ranges, concentrations, and reproductive areas will yield pertinent information relative to the importance of different oceanic currents and water masses in the marine ecology of our coasts. Among the marine animals that are known to feed upon the euphausiids are especially such fish as the herring and sardine, and also the whalebone whales whose diet is, despite their huge size, almost exclusively plankton. A literature too voluminous to review here bears this out for both the fish and mammals. The catch of baleen whales is remarkably closely correlated with the abundance and swarming of euphausiids in the Atlantic and Antarctic waters. Locally, the California gray whale is known to feed at least in part upon Euphausia pacifica, the most common euphausiid off our coast. Similarly, the humpback whales of our coast were found to have fed upon “shrimp.” The place of euphausiids in the diet of the California sardine and other local fishes is presently under investigation in connection with the Marine Life Research program. The euphausiids are food not only to fish and other aquatic animals but to a lesser extent also to sea birds. The euphausiids usually live at depths beyond the range of surface-feeding animals, but during swarming, vast hoards may migrate to the very surface within reach of large flocks of birds. These swarmings may be within restricted areas as in the passages between Passamaquoddy Bay and the Bay of Fundy. Here Meganyctiphanes norvegica and Thysanoëssa spp. rise in the turbulent water within reach of sea gulls and other birds. On the open coast off La Jolla, California, swarms of female Thysanoëssa spinifera that had migrated to the upper water layers were swept ashore and stranded upon the beach. In Australian waters “rafts” of Nyctiphanes australis, covering an acre in extent, may occur at the surface where they are fed upon by the muttonbird. Finally, euphausiids may hold a place directly in the diet of man himself. Japanese fishermen sometimes catch vast numbers of these crustaceans, which periodically swarm in the deep bays of Honshu Island. The niche occupied by the euphausiids in the food chain of the sea requires also a consideration of the food upon which they themselves subsist. Some progress along this line has been made by various workers. Much remains to be done. Einarsson (1945) reviews briefly pertinent literature which brings evidence to show that the diet of euphausiids consists of both diatoms and microcrustaceans, but chiefly of the phytoplankton diatoms. Floating detritus is also an item of diet, but further study is needed in determining the efficiency of the feeding mechanisms in screening out the very finest particulate organic material known to be present in the sea water. The feeding mechanism of the euphausiids consists of a basket formed by the thoracic appendages, the inner margins of which are provided with long plumose bristles or setae. Water is strained through the bristles, and the small organisms and detritus are screened out as the animal swims through the water propelled by the swimming feet (pleopods) on the abdomen. Important also are the mouth parts. The mouth parts are situated immediately in front of the thoracic appendages. From anterior to posterior, they consist of labrum, mandibles (with “teeth” and palps), labia, first maxillae, and second maxillae. There are no maxillipeds differing from the thoracic appendages. The first and second maxillae are small, but they are well provided with many rather short setae and spines which are apparently used mainly in holding or transferring food particles to the labia and mandibles. The active feeding process of euphausiids was not studied but, from consideration of the structure of the feeding mechanisms, it appears that at least in Euphausia pacifica an important nonscreening device is the pair of mandibular palps. These palps are designed to move the food particles from the basket and maxillae into reach of the labia and mandibles and doubtless to hold larger particles against the mandibles during mastication. The end segment of each palp is provided with a row of strong, curved spines along the posterior edge. The palps are rotated somewhat toward the mid-line to show the orientation of the spines. In Nematoscelis difficilis the mandibular palps are much shorter and may therefore serve a more restricted function. In the genus the second pair of thoracic legs are enormously elongated, but it is not clear with what feeding function this modification may be associated. Although much of the food material consists of detrital particles or organisms of very small size, this is only a fraction of the diet. Larger objects such as copepod larvae, and even adults, form a part of the food of Meganyctiphanes norvegica. The well-developed mandibles with chitinized gnathobase attest to this fact. They are each provided with a cutting incisor process and a molar process useful in crushing.

Complete genome sequence of an astrovirus identified in a domestic rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) with gastroenteritis
Abstract
				
				A colony of domestic rabbits in Tennessee, USA, experienced a high-mortality (~90%) outbreak of enterocolitis. The clinical characteristics were one to six days of lethargy, bloating, and diarrhea, followed by death. Heavy intestinal coccidial load was a consistent finding as was mucoid enteropathy with cecal impaction. Preliminary analysis by electron microscopy revealed the presence of virus-like particles in the stool of one of the affected rabbits. Analysis using the Virochip, a viral detection microarray, suggested the presence of an astrovirus, and follow-up PCR and sequence determination revealed a previously uncharacterized member of that family. Metagenomic sequencing enabled the recovery of the complete viral genome, which contains the characteristic attributes of astrovirus genomes. Attempts to propagate the virus in tissue culture have yet to succeed. Although astroviruses cause gastroenteric disease in other mammals, the pathogenicity of this virus and the relationship to this outbreak remains to be determined. This study therefore defines a viral species and a potential rabbit pathogen.

Nutritional Ecology of a Generalist Herbivore <italic>Vanessa cardui</italic> Linnaeus (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) on Variable Larval and Adult Diets
This dissertation research examined whether generalist feeding <italic>Vanessa cardui </italic>larvae display dietary self-selection, what rules of compromise are followed when larvae are constrained to suboptimal diet, how larval and adult nutrition affect butterfly fitness, and whether adults are able to compensate for variations in larval nutrition with differential adult foraging. First, I examined dietary self-selection and rules of compromise for protein and digestible carbohydrate intake by 5th instar <italic>V. cardui</italic> larvae. Larvae regulated nutrient intake to a near equal-ratio protein:carbohydrate in choice trials, consistent with results found for other Lepidoptera. Larvae on no-choice diets had reduced fitness on protein-biased or carbohydrate-biased larval diets relative to equal-ratio, and the rule of compromise exhibited by <italic>V. cardui</italic> is consistent with that expected for a generalist herbivore. Second, I determined whether larval nutrition affects adult foraging behaviors. Females reared on carbohydrate-biased diet were more likely to probe towards nectar mimic containing sugars and amino acids than towards mimic containing sugars alone. Butterflies reared on protein-biased diet consumed more nectar than butterflies reared on carbohydrate-biased diet. Butterflies, however, did not exhibit preference between sugar and sugar plus amino acids solutions, regardless of larval nutrition.Third, I examined the relative importance of larval and adult dietary nutrient intake on <italic>V. cardui</italic> fitness. Adult nutrition played a greater role in realized fitness than larval nutrition, but was mediated by larval dietary history. The most important factor influencing female fitness was adult carbohydrate consumption. Nectar-derived amino acids did not appear to increase fitness, but appeared to negatively affect total egg production when butterflies were reared on equal-ratio larval diet.Lastly, I studied whether <italic>V. cardui</italic> exhibit mate choice based on the levels of proteins/amino acids and carbohydrates on which potential mates fed. Mate choice was not affected by larval diet, but was affected by the adult diet of potential mates. Overall, selecting butterflies were more likely to pair with animals provided sugar and amino acids than those given sugar alone. Those fed protein-biased diet as juveniles and sugars plus amino acids as adults were most preferred, while animals provided carbohydrate-biased diet and sugars were least preferred.

Interdisciplinary Pest Management Potentials of Cover Cropping Systems
Societal demands are increasing for safe crop production systems because of ecological and health risks of pesticides. Cover crops are an alternative to pesticides that may promote crop production. A three-year experiment was conducted to assess the multidisciplinary pest management potential of selected cover crops. The cover crops were planted during the summer and compared with a no-plant summer fallow system as a control treatment. The cropping treatments were assessed for concurrent suppression of weeds, parasitic nematodes, insect pests and their enhancement of beneficial organisms within the subsequent vegetable crop.  The research was conducted at the South Coast Research and Extension Station in Irvine, California. Results indicated that the cover crops suppressed weed population densities and their biomass accumulation. Cover crop weed suppression was stronger against broadleaf weeds than grasses and intensity of suppression increased with increasing years of cover cropping rotations, indicating the buildup effect of the system. The cover crop provided stronger weed suppression when coupled with hand weeding, suggesting the importance of cover crops in an integrated weed management system. The cover crops also reduced the time required for supplemental hand weeding, indicating their potential economic benefits.  While the off-season cover crops did not show any benefit for suppression of parasitic nematodes and insect pests in the subsequent vegetable crop, the system had significantly increased saprophytic nematode populations which play a beneficial role in improving soil nutrient status. The off-season cover crops also enhanced parasitoid populations and insect pest parasitization levels in the subsequent broccoli crop. At the same time, the cover crops preconditioned and improved soil and crop nutrition. Overall, the cover crops had combined effects on weed suppression, higher populations of beneficial organisms, enhanced soil and crop nutrition, and increased height, canopy growth, and leaf production of the vegetable crop. These combined effects resulted in higher productivity and marketable yields of broccoli compared to those grown on a summer fallow plot. Therefore the use of off-season cover-cropping rotations can provide multiple concurrent benefits to the productivity of vegetable crops.

Good Start Out of the Gate: Tobacco Industry Political Influence and Tobacco Policymaking in Kentucky 1936-2012
Executive Summary 
      Kentucky, a leading tobacco producing state in the U.S. and home to Brown and Williamson and Commonwealth Brands tobacco companies, has a significant historic, economic, and social heritage tied to tobacco.  Until 2004 tobacco was grown in all but one county in the state, mostly on small family farms.  The significant tobacco industry presence created a historical resistance to
         tobacco control efforts.  
      To influence policymakers, between 1994 and 2010 the tobacco industry contributed $311,614 to Kentucky political parties and individual candidates running for state-level offices, focusing contributions around pivotal elections, with candidates for governor and key legislative leadership being the largest recipients. Additionally, between 1993 and 2012, the tobacco industry spent
         $9.7 million in lobbying expenditures.   
      In 1988, the first statewide tobacco control coalition focused their initial efforts on youth as a noncontroversial strategy to introduce tobacco control issues in the tobacco growing state. Beginning in 1994 state tobacco control advocates worked with state policymakers and tobacco farmers to create the Coalition for Health and Agricultural Development. The coalition set a
         statewide and national precedent for tobacco control advocates and tobacco farmers working together to address tobacco-related health and economic issues.
      In 1994, the tobacco industry used efforts by tobacco control advocates to reduce youth smoking by passing a state law prohibiting youth access to tobacco products as an effective medium to lobby for the enactment of a weak youth access law that included state preemption to prohibit community-level activity to limit youth access to tobacco products. The 1994 legislation also
         included a provision that required designated smoking areas in government buildings where smoking was restricted. Later, this requirement would dissuade local governments from covering workplaces since government workplaces would be exempt or forced to install expensive ventilation equipment.
      Since 1997, the prevalence of youth tobacco use in Kentucky has declined. In 2011, the youth tobacco use rate was 24.1 percent, a decrease from 26.1 percent in 2009. However, in 2011, the prevalence of youth tobacco use in Kentucky (24.1 percent) was still higher than the national average (19.5 percent) and Kentucky was ranked 1st for the highest youth tobacco use rates. Between
         2001 and 2010 there were increases in smokeless tobacco use among youth and adults, and in cigarette smoking rates among low socio-economic status adults.
      The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement was an important event for tobacco prevention and control in the tobacco growing state. Tobacco farmers in Kentucky had a shift in attitude and were more receptive and willing to work with state tobacco control advocates to use a portion of the state’s Master Settlement Agreement monies for tobacco control programming.
      In 2000, state tobacco control advocates secured 2.5 percent ($5.5 million for the first biennium 2001-2002) of the state’s Master Settlement Agreement monies for tobacco prevention and control programming, with most of the funding going to build policymaking capacity at the local level. The local health department tobacco control programs worked to create awareness about tobacco
         use issues that synergistically worked with state tobacco control advocacy efforts on smoke-free air policies.
      Between 1971 and 2012, the state tobacco excise tax had only been raised twice from 3-cents to 30-cents in 2005 and from 30 cents to 60 cents in 2009. While state tobacco control advocates wanted to increase the tobacco excise tax to reduce youth tobacco use, the state tobacco excise tax increase was used to mitigate significant state budget shortfalls.          
      Between 2000 and 2012, the state program worked with local health department programs and state agencies, and used contracts with the University of Kentucky and University of Louisville to provide technical assistance in achieving the local program goals and objectives. The state program experienced success in reducing exposure to secondhand smoke through local communities
         working to achieve smokefree air.
      In 2004, state tobacco control advocates successfully enacted the first local smoke-free air ordinance in the state in Lexington-Fayette. The tobacco industry unsuccessfully tried to overturn the law through litigation, and by state legislation to preempt local smokefree air policies. 
      State tobacco control advocates used the Smoke-Free Lexington-Fayette campaign as a model to garner public support to protect workers and public health through additional local smoke-free air policies throughout the state. 
      Between 2005 and 2012, state tobacco control advocates, led by the University of Kentucky Center for Smoke-free Policy (KCSP) successfully enacted 35 smokefree policies (22 were comprehensive) to protect 34.1 percent of the state’s population.   
      In 2006, state tobacco control advocates successfully pushed for legislation to allow local governments to prohibit smoking in local government buildings without being required to assign designated smoking areas, which allowed state tobacco control advocates to begin strengthening local smoke-free measures to include all workplaces. Local governments had been reluctant to
         include workplaces in smokefree ordinances since it could not include local government workplaces.  In addition, Governor Fletcher issued an Executive Order to prohibit indoor smoking in state government buildings controlled by the Executive Branch.  For the first time in the history of the state, smoking was prohibited in most state government buildings. 
      In 2010, state tobacco control advocates implemented the Smoke-Free Kentucky campaign and five-year plan to advocate for a statewide smoke-free air law. In 2012, the smokefree air legislation was voted out of the House Health and Welfare Committee, which represented a significant step forward since previous efforts did not pass in committee. 
      Tobacco control advocates should continue to work to protect, strengthen, and pass local smokefree air policies and other tobacco control policies, advocating for the repeal of preemption of local control for youth access, and for increases in tobacco excise taxes.
      State tobacco control advocates can further strengthen their efforts by exposing the tobacco manufacturer ties, through campaign contributions and lobbying expenditures, to legislators who propose to threaten the advances that have been made in tobacco control.
      State tobacco control advocates should continue to seek higher tobacco excise taxes and for increased tobacco control funding for a sustained tobacco prevention media campaign. 
      State tobacco control advocates should build on their successful track record by giving priority to continuing to protect, strengthen, and pass local smokefree air policies and 100% tobacco free schools.
      Recognizing the politically hostile environment in tobacco growing state legislatures, state tobacco control advocates should take a strong public position that state preemption of local smokefree air policies is a “deal breaker” for any state smokefree law and pledge to work to kill any such law, regardless of the other provisions.

Tobacco Use In California 1990-1991
Summary
      This report presents data from a survey of cigarette smoking behaviors and attitudes among Californians conducted between June, 1990 and July, 1991.  The prevalence of current smoking among adults in California was 22.2%, with males (25.5%) smoking more than females (19.1%).  This represents a sharp decline in smoking following the increase in the tobacco excise tax and implementation of a comprehensive tobacco control program by the State of California.  The decline in prevalence is on track for reaching the goal of a 75% reduction in smoking prevalence by the year 1999.
      Black Californians were more likely to be cigarette smokers than other racial or ethnic groups, and Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander women were less likely to be cigarette smokers.  Smoking prevalence was also lower among those who have completed more years of formal education and among those who were over the age of 65 years.
      Current smoking prevalence among adolescents aged 12-17 years was 9.3%; little difference in prevalence rates was found between boys and girls.
      The prevalence of smoking prior to pregnancy among women who had been pregnant in the last 5 years was 16.1%, and 32.8% of those who did smoke quit before the pregnancy reached term.
      Approximately one-half of California smokers made an attempt to quit in the 12 months before the survey.  The rate of quit attempts was higher among Black smokers of both sexes and among Hispanic males.  However, California smokers were unable to translate their high rate of cessation attempts into successful cessation.  Only 11.3% of those who were smokers one year ago were nonsmokers at the time of the survey.  This high rate of failed cessation attempts is most evident for Black males where 60.2% of those who were smoking one year ago attempted to quit, but only 4% were current nonsmokers.
      The status and effectiveness of several of the components of the tobacco control campaign were assessed.  Among adolescents, 72.6% reported receiving at least one class in school directed at tobacco education.
      Among nonsmoking Californians who work indoors, 31.3% reported recent exposure to environmental tobacco smoke at work, but this exposure was substantially lower among the 38.7% of indoor workers who work where there was at least a ban on smoking in the immediate work area.  Exposure was further reduced for those workers who work in jurisdictions that have strong ordinances to limit smoking in the workplace.  Those who worked in worksites that ban smoking in the work area are less likely to be cigarette smokers, and male smokers who worked where there was a ban on smoking in the work area were more likely to be successful when they attempted to quit.  Social pressure not to smoke, as manifested by the reluctance of smokers to smoke when they were the only smoker, was associated with an increased frequency of quit attempts by smokers, particularly female smokers.
      Tobacco advertising, particularly the Camel cigarette advertising campaign using cartoon characters, was differentially recognized by younger adolescents.  The recognition of cigarette brand advertising was closely related to the brand of cigarettes purchased by adolescent smokers, suggesting that tobacco advertising may promote smoking initiation among adolescents.
      Over 60% of adults and two-thirds of adolescents reported exposure to some anti-smoking media message in the 7 days prior to their survey interview.  Those who reported exposure to the television spots funded by the tobacco tax revenues were more likely to support anti-tobacco education in schools.
      Adolescents reported that tobacco products were readily available, even among those aged 12-14.  Small stores were the most common site of purchase of cigarettes for adolescents of all ages, but there was a suggestion that purchases from vending machines were relatively more common among younger adolescents than among older adolescents.
      Only 40.4% of those smokers who saw a physician in the last year were advised to quit on the last visit.  Advice to quit on the last visit appeared to be associated with both an increased interest in quitting and an increased number of quit attempts.
      There was widespread support for taxation to tobacco products.  The support for increasing the tax was lower among smokers, but Hispanic smokers were more supportive of increasing the tax than were California smokers as a whole.  Black and Hispanic smokers were more strongly supportive of efforts to ban advertising and promotion of tobacco products as well as to restrict access of children to tobacco products.  This picture is consistent with a substantial level of concern in the Black and Hispanic communities about the targeting of their communities by the tobacco advertisers.

Discovery and investigation of the thiazole/oxazole modified microcin natural product family
Thiazole/Oxazole Modified Microcins (TOMMs) represent a large, widely distributed family of ribosomally encoded natural products. This family of enzymes selectively modify cysteine, serine and threonine amino acid residues to five-membered heterocyclic rings. A diverse set of bacterial organisms have utilized the TOMM biosynthetic pathway to create a multitude of natural products with a wide range of activities. Chapter II describes how the TOMM family was created using bioinformatic searches to expand the known set of natural product biosynthetic gene clusters from four to over 250, each encoding a different natural product. Included in this new family is streptolysin S (SLS) a virulent toxin produced by human pathogenic bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes. We showed through in vitro analysis that SLS is a heterocycle containing TOMM natural product. In Chapter III we used biochemical studies to identified the precursor peptide residues that were essential for SLS hemolytic activity. From this information we were able to generate artificial precursor peptides that had hemolytic activity upon TOMM posttranslational modification. It was shown that SLS biosynthesis relies on the same substrate binding motif as microcin B17. In Chapter IV a SLS-like TOMM cluster in Clostridium botulinum was characterized. Mass spectrometry was used to identify sites of heterocyclization in SLS as well as in its close relative clostridiolysin S. Chapter V described the generation of an E. coli based bioengineering strategy for reconstituting SLS activity ex vivo, the first example of an active SLS analog being produced in another organism outside of the firmicutes phylum. This represents a method for generating high yields of TOMM natural products in a high throughput manner. In Chapter VI we validated the expression of the unannotated TOMM precursor peptides identified in Chapter II. RT-PCR, gene knockouts and in vitro activity assays were used to demonstrate expression

Two MAP kinases regulate novel aspects of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response
Secreted proteins, plasma membrane proteins, and proteins that reside within the secretory pathway must be folded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which provides an environment that allows the proper folding and assembly of these nascent proteins. In response to environmental and developmental signals, the cellular requirement for the ER's protein folding function can fluctuate. When the protein folding demand exceeds the ER's capacity, this results in the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER, a toxic condition known as ER stress. Currently, the only pathway known to respond to ER stress is the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, which rapidly activates genes that help expand the ER's folding capacity. A genetic screen in yeast suggests that two mitogen- activated protein kinases (MAPKs), Slt2 and Hog1, might also become activated along with the UPR to help cells cope with ER stress. MAPKs function throughout eukaryotic cell biology to initiate cellular changes in response to environmental stimuli. In this dissertation, I show that Slt2 and Hog1 are activated by ER stress, I investigate the mechanism of activation for each kinase, and I define several downstream functions of the MAPKs during ER stress. First, I show that ER stress in budding yeast induces a cytokinesis delay that correlates with alterations in the septin complex, an important regulator of cytokinesis. This cytokinesis delay is accompanied by a delay in ER inheritance. Both may serve to prevent the propagation of ER stress. The cytokinesis delay, septin alterations, and ER inheritance delay all depend upon the MAPK SLT2. Second, I show that Hog1 becomes activated during late-stage ER stress, through a mechanism with UPR- dependent and UPR-independent components. Upon activation, Hog1 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and then later returns to the cytoplasm. In the nucleus, Hog1 activates the transcription of at least one gene, HSP12. Hog1 also regulates the induction of autophagy during ER stress and appears to perform this function from the cytoplasm. Overall, I show that the cellular response to ER stress is much broader than the UPR, involving the activation of additional signaling modules, and affecting a wide range of cellular processes

Environmental and social responsibility in the coffee industry : a case for Oaxaca, Mexico
The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives implemented by large coffee corporations and determine whether their practices could be applied to Oaxaca, Mexico's coffee growing region to improve that region's coffee sector. While Oaxaca has the topographic propensity to grow quality coffee, its success as a reputable coffee growing region has been stagnated. This project indicated that Oaxaca is not prospering in high quality or niche coffee markets due to interrelated issues of inefficiency in the sector, high levels of poverty in coffee growing regions, lack of business training and agronomy education, and inconsistent aid from both state and federal governments. To make up for the region's shortcomings, it is recommended that Oaxaca look to CSR, which in part has been applied through nonprofit organizations' certification schemes such as Fair Trade USA, Rainforest Alliance or UTZ CERTIFIED. This study recommends that Oaxacan farmers first look to systems that focus on farmer training and improving the quality and consistency of their coffee beans. It is then recommended that farmers seek out niche markets and certification schemes that reward farmers with price premiums. By distinguishing their coffee from the conventional coffee market, farmers may "de-commodify" their coffee, making it more valuable and less susceptible to the volatile coffee commodity market. The study also concludes that there is a need for a reform in the sector's auditing practices, and that civil society is a vital component for stimulating increased sales of ethically sourced coffee

Tobacco Use in California 1990: A Preliminary Report Documenting the Decline of Tobacco Use
Summary
      This report presents data on a partial sample of a survey of cigarette smoking behaviors and attitudes among Californians conducted during the summer of 1990.  The prevalence of current smoking among adults in California is 21.2% with males (23.8%) smoking more than females (18.8%).  This represents a sharp decline in smoking following the increase in the tobacco excise tax and implementation of a comprehensive tobacco control program by the State of California, and is on track for reaching the goal of a 75% reduction in smoking prevalence by the year 1999.
      Black Californians are more likely to be cigarette smokers than other racial or ethnic groups,  and Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander women are less likely to be cigarette smokers.  Smoking prevalence is also lower among those who have completed more years of formal education and among those who are over the age of 65 years.
      Current smoking prevalence among adolescents aged 12-17 years is 10.4%; little difference in prevalence rates is found between boys and girls.
      The prevalence of smoking prior to pregnancy among women who have been pregnant in the last 5 years was 15.7%, and 36% quit before the pregnancy reached term.
      Among the counties and regions, there are only modest differences in the observed prevalence of smoking, but there is a somewhat greater observed difference in the fraction of those smokers who have quit in the last 5 years.
      Approximately one-half of California’s smokers made an attempt to quit in the 12 months before the survey, in contrast to one-third of smokers nationally.  The rate of quit attempts was highest among black smokers of both sexes and among Hispanic males.  However, California smokers were unable to translate their high rate of cessation attempts into successful cessation.  Only 11.7% of those who were smokers one year ago are currently nonsmokers.  This high rate of failed cessation attempts is most evident for black males where 72% of those who were smoking one year ago attempted to quit but only 3.6% are currently nonsmokers.
      The hazard of smoking is widely acknowledged; 84% of California smokers agree that smoking harms their own health.  This acknowledgement is, if anything, somewhat stronger among black and Hispanic smokers, suggesting that informational campaigns have been successful but have not translated into successful cessation, particularly for black male smokers.
      There is widespread support for taxation of tobacco products: 49.5% of Californian adults support a further increase in the current tax and only 15.9% want to reduce the tax.  The support for increasing the tax is lower among smokers, but black and Hispanic smokers are substantially more supportive of increasing the tax than are California smokers as a whole.  Black and Hispanic smokers are also more strongly supportive of efforts to ban the advertising and promotion of tobacco products as well as to restrict the access of children to tobacco products.  This picture is consistent with a substantial level of concern in the black and Hispanic communities about the targeting of their communities by tobacco advertisers.

The molecules we eat: food as a medium to communicate science
Abstract
				
				Creative, inquiry-driven approaches in science education help to address the growing need to effectively engage students and promote the public understanding of science. Here we describe an interactive format using food that can be applied both in a course for undergraduate students, as well as in a lecture for the general public. Communicating science through food may also dispel fear of naturally occurring chemicals as well as scientific misconceptions that are propagated by the media.

[stinkwort, weed, california, annual]

Stinkwort is rapidly expanding its range in California
Stinkwort (Dittrichia graveolens) is a Mediterranean native that  has become a weed in areas of Europe as well as in Australia. This  strongly aromatic weed was first reported in California in 1984 in Santa  Clara County, and it had spread to 36 of the 58 California counties by  2012. Stinkwort is not palatable to animals, and can be poisonous to  livestock and cause contact allergic dermatitis in humans. In  California, this weed is found primarily along roadsides. However, the  biology of this annual plant suggests that it could also invade open  riparian areas and overgrazed rangelands. Stinkwort has an unusual life  cycle among annual plants: Unlike most summer or late-season winter  annuals, stinkwort flowers and produces seeds from September to  December. Such basic biological information is critical to developing  timely and effective control strategies for this rapidly expanding weed.

The Cost of Crop Damage Caused by Ozone Air Pollution From Motor Vehicles
The detrimental effects of ambient ozone on crops, even at relatively low concentrations, are well-established (Thompson et al., 1976; Heck and Brandt, 1977; Heck et al., 1982; Environmental Protection Agency, 1984; California Air Resources Board, 1987; Olszyk et al., 1988a, 1988b; Heagle et al., 1986; McCool et al., 1986, Ashmore, 1991).  Ozone enters plant leaves through the stomatal openings in the leaf surface and then produces byproducts that reduce the efficiency of photosynthesis (CARB, 1987).  Research suggests that ozone, either alone or in combination with nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide, may be responsible for up to 90 percent of U.S. crop losses resulting from air pollution (Heck et al., 1982).  In an effort to address this problem, the Clean Air Act and its amendments include air pollution damages to vegetation as one of the criteria by which secondary national ambient air quality standards are evaluated (Adams et al., 1984).
      There is, of course, an economic cost associated with this reduced productivity. In this paper we use a formal model of agricultural production and demand to estimate the cost of crop damage1 due to all anthropogenic ozone air pollution, and to ozone air pollution attributable to motor-vehicle use in the U. S. in 1990.

A proactive smoking cessation intervention with hospitalized smokers : a randomized controlled trial
Smoking interferes with the recovery and healing process for hospitalized patients. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospital Organizations (JCAHO) requires that hospitals offer smoking cessation assistance, which involves brief bedside counseling for patients of certain diagnoses. It is generally recognized that hospitalization creates a "teachable moment" for smoking cessation. In fact, most smokers quit smoking while hospitalized. However, most of them relapse soon after discharge. There is a need to develop intervention programs that can increase the long-term quit rate of these patients post discharge. The present study is a small randomized controlled trial. It compares the usual-care condition, where smokers received bedside counseling from respiratory therapists, to an enhanced treatment condition, which included provision of eight weeks of nicotine patches at discharge plus proactive telephone counseling from a quitline up to two months post discharge. Hospitalized smokers of all diagnoses were included in the study, except those hospitalized for psychiatric reasons and pregnant women. A total of 126 smokers were recruited into the study. The sample size was not powered to find a statistically significant result on the long-term quit rate, but it is large enough to provide a good estimate of effect size for the intervention. Study participants were evaluated at two and six months for their smoking status. At two months 78.0% of the sample was contacted. In an intent-to-treat analysis in which all those not contacted are assumed to be smokers, 26.6% in enhanced-treatment (ET) group and 6.5% in usual-care (UC) group had quit smoking for at least 30 days (OR=5.2, p<0.01). At six months, 57.9% were contacted. An intent-to-treat analysis found 9.4% in ET and 6.4% in UC had quit for at least 180 days (OR=1.5, p=0.74). This study found that an intervention that combined nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and telephone counseling had a significant effect, up to two months. There was substantial relapse between two and six months, but the odds ratio between the two conditions was still respectable. Future studies would include a larger sample size and would also investigate ways to reduce relapse rate in the long term

Seed Packaging and Seed Characteristics in a Raphanus Hybrid-Derived Lineage
Hybridization is accountable for a considerable number of plant species of which some are remarkably good invaders. Interspecific hybridization can promote plant invasiveness by leading to (1) higher reproductive output, (2) higher genetic diversity, and (3) novel traits or genotypes resulting in range expansion. Through descriptive and experimental analyses, the aim of this study is to understand if an invasive hybrid-derived lineage, California wild radish, varies in novel traits such as fruit structure and within-fruit seed characteristics, relative to its two progenitors, the cultivar <italic>Raphanus sativus</italic> and the wild <italic>R. raphanistrum</italic>. I first asked if changes in fruit structural and material properties have important effects on pre-dispersal granivory. Data included fruit morphometrics, biomechanical measurements of the strength necessary to break open the fruit wall, and records of removal after experimentally exposing the fruits to granivores. Combining these data revealed that hybrid fruits differ structurally from fruits of both progenitors, thereby lowering the damage rates by granivores. Second, I asked if pre-dispersal seed predation differs among the three Raphanus lineages and if there are fitness consequences resulting from this. Plants from all three lineages were sown in common gardens, either protected or unprotected from avian granivory experiments. Relative to both progenitors, the hybrid lineage suffered the highest rates of granivory at the unprotected treatments but its seed and fruit production was not depressed by granivory. Finally, I explored how within-fruit seed characteristics may be a feature explaining the competitive superiority of the hybrid-derived lineage. I addressed this topic by directly comparing patterns of within-fruit seed size, paternity, and fitness variables including fecundity and phenology. Within-fruit seed paternity revealed that all three lineages have multiple paternity and that in natural conditions the identity of the pollen donor affects seed weight and final reproductive output. The hybrid-derived lineage had larger peduncular seeds. Taken together, these results indicate that the strength of the fruit wall is a key defense mechanism underlying invasion success in the hybrid-derived lineage.

Food deserts and access to fresh food in low-income San Diego
Government studies and public health literature have long promoted supermarkets as the optimal retail outlet for affordable, healthy food. This emphasis on large, nationwide, corporate-owned stores obscures the ability of other, smaller retail outlets to provide fresh produce in low-income neighborhoods. While, indeed, many urban neighborhoods lack retailers that offer produce for sale, ethnic enclaves offer an alternative image of a fresh food environment within a low-income community. This study looks at the presence and price of fresh produce in three San Diego neighborhoods that are classified as "low- income." The results of this study counter the characterization of small, independent grocery stores as unable or unwilling to offer produce at low prices. Both predominantly-mexicano neighborhoods have a greater number of stores with produce for sale than the non-immigrant neighborhood in Southeast San Diego. Also, the average price of produce in the stores in these immigrant neighborhoods does not differ significantly from prices offered by a discount supermarket in the non-immigrant neighborhood. The persistence of these ethnic enclaves that demand produce and place great importance on the culture of the mercado creates an alternative economic sphere in which small stores are responsive to the demands of neighborhood residents. This provides affordable healthy food to low-income households, allows immigrants to hold on to their own ideas of cuisine, and prevents coerced assimilation to the unhealthy diet of American society

AGRARIAN CHANGE, AGROECOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATION AND THE COFFEE CRISIS IN COSTA RICA
Between 1999 and 2005 the deregulation of the international coffee commodity chain produced both a coffee crisis, characterized by the lowest prices ever for coffee farmers in producing countries, as well as a coffee boom within consuming countries as "the latte revolution" took shape. This research seeks to understand how social, economic and environmental change have unfolded in the producing country of Costa Rica following this coffee crisis. The impacts of two resistance strategies that peasant coffee farmers and their allies have deployed in the face of this crisis are tested: participation in Fair Trade marketing networks and the adoption of agroecological farming practices. Over six years of ethnographic community-based fieldwork, more than 70 agrobiodiversity inventories, archival research, semi-structured interviews, numerous farmer focus groups as well as a randomized survey of more than 100 farm-households were the main methodologies utilized to gather data for this research project.I find that Fair Trade price premiums were inconsequential in providing support for smallholder resistance to the coffee crisis in Costa Rica. I find pivotal, the role played by Costa Rican governmental institutions in a successful agroecological transition that reduced external input costs. This is significant because the process took place amidst the backdrop of "roll-back neoliberalism" characterized by privatization and declining state involvement in the provision of services. With no market, not even a "fair" one, able or willing to provide the training and unique resources these smallholders needed, the state not only stepped in, but was successful according to the results of this study. With innumerable environmental, social and economic spillover effects of this transition process accruing at several scales, the results of this study argue for the creation or redirection of state-led institutions with the power and support to conduct agroecological research and training, especially in the de-technification transitional process to low-external input agriculture.

Evolutionary relationships of ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) uptake porters
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					The ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) functional superfamily includes integral transmembrane exporters that have evolved three times independently, forming three families termed ABC1, ABC2 and ABC3, upon which monophyletic ATPases have been superimposed for energy-coupling purposes e.g., J Membr Biol 231(1):1-10, 2009. The goal of the work reported in this communication was to understand how the integral membrane constituents of ABC uptake transporters with different numbers of predicted or established transmembrane segments (TMSs) evolved. In a few cases, high resolution 3-dimensional structures were available, and in these cases, their structures plus primary sequence analyses allowed us to predict evolutionary pathways of origin.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					All of the 35 currently recognized families of ABC uptake proteins except for one (family 21) were shown to be homologous using quantitative statistical methods. These methods involved using established programs that compare native protein sequences with each other, after having compared each sequence with thousands of its own shuffled sequences, to gain evidence for homology. Topological analyses suggested that these porters contain numbers of TMSs ranging from four or five to twenty. Intragenic duplication events occurred multiple times during the evolution of these porters. They originated from a simple primordial protein containing 3 TMSs which duplicated to 6 TMSs, and then produced porters of the various topologies via insertions, deletions and further duplications. Except for family 21 which proved to be related to ABC1 exporters, they are all related to members of the previously identified ABC2 exporter family. Duplications that occurred in addition to the primordial 3&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;6 duplication included 5&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;10, 6&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;12 and 10&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;20 TMSs. In one case, protein topologies were uncertain as different programs gave discrepant predictions. It could not be concluded with certainty whether a 4 TMS ancestral protein or a 5 TMS ancestral protein duplicated to give an 8 or a 10 TMS protein. Evidence is presented suggesting but not proving that the 2TMS repeat unit in ABC1 porters derived from the two central TMSs of ABC2 porters. These results provide structural information and plausible evolutionary pathways for the appearance of most integral membrane constituents of ABC uptake transport systems.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					Almost all integral membrane uptake porters of the ABC superfamily belong to the ABC2 family, previously established for exporters. Most of these proteins can have 5, 6, 10, 12 or 20 TMSs per polypeptide chain. Evolutionary pathways for their appearance are proposed.

HOT Lanes: An Evolution of Costs, Benefits and Performance
This dissertation compares the effects of HOTLs, congestion toll lanes, GPLs and HOVLs. A deterministic travel-demand model that estimates the comparative travel times under competing investment scenarios is adapted here to consider how tolls influence ridesharing. The results indicate that HOTLs, congestion toll lanes and GPLs provide a greater degree of system-wide delay-reduction benefits than HOVLs in most cases. Furthermore, when maximum mainline peak highway delays are between 20 and 40 minutes, congestion toll lanes provide a greater reduction in overall delays and emissions than GPLs.
      This research provides support for the policy claim that in almost all local urban travel conditions, HOT lanes provide a greater degree of fiscal, consumer welfare, and environmental benefits than all other life-haul urban expressway investments. HOT lanes are the only urban highway facilities capable of withstanding induced growth effects, and preserving congestion-free service after an initial reduction in travel costs. In the few cases in which the delay reduction benefits of toll lanes and GPLs are roughly comparable, the revenue-producing nature of toll roads greatly lowers the comparative social cost of long-term highway maintenance and rehabilitation. Although the HOT lane capital costs are significantly higher than HOV lanes, a 10-mile HOT lane facility can provide up to $20 million in annual revenue (in 2000 dollars). Because HOT lanes preserve congestion-free service in the face of traffic growth, HOT lanes are more environmental beneficial than either HOVLs and GPLs. This research provides support for federal policies that expand the use of tolling on urban interstate highways, especially in non-attainment areas where states are ineligible for new highway construction funds.

ShelfScanner : toward real-time detection of groceries for the visually impaired
We present a study on grocery detection using our object detection system, ShelfScanner, which seeks to allow a visually impaired user to shop at a grocery store without additional human assistance. ShelfScanner allows online detection of items on a shopping list, in video streams in which some or all items could appear simultaneously. To deal with the scale of the object detection task, the system leverages the approximate planarity of grocery store shelves to build a mosaic in real time using an optical flow algorithm. The system is then free to use any object detection algorithm without incurring a loss of data due to processing time. For purposes of speed we use a multiclass naive-Bayes classifier inspired by NIMBLE, which is trained on enhanced SURF descriptors extracted from images in the GroZi-120 dataset. It is then used to compute per-class probability distributions on video keypoints for final classification. Our results suggest ShelfScanner could be useful in cases where high-quality training data is available

Inhalation of Vehicle Emissions in Urban Environments
This dissertation explores the relationship between motor vehicle emissions and the human inhalation intake of these emissions. Motor vehicles are ubiquitous to urban areas throughout the world. In most urban areas, vehicle emission are a significant contributor to air pollution problems. Inhalation of vehicle emissions has been shown to cause a number of adverse health effects. Better understanding of the relationship between emissions and inhalation will aid in designing effective strategies to reduce air pollution health effects. Understanding the emission-to-inhalation relationship is also important for estimating the total health impacts attributable emissions from a specific air pollution source, such as motor vehicles in a specific city.
      Three objectives of his dissertation are (1) to quantify the emission-to-inhalation relationship in a way that is useful to other air quality and health researchers and to policy analysts; (2) to employ a variety of analytic approaches, in order to understand better the relative strengths and weakness of each approach; and (3) to demonstrate that the conclusions one draws from air quality analyses may depend on whether one uses as the figure-of-merit inhalation of air pollution, as is done for analyses in this work, or other common air quality metrics such as mass emission rate, ambient concentrations, or concentration at the location of the maximally exposed individual.
      The methods employed here include several data analysis and modeling approaches. The data analyses incorporate a range of inputs, including results from air dispersion models of varying sophistication, tracer-gas experiments, and “tracers of opportunity” (gases that are emitted primarily by one source or source category). The inhalation model that I develop in Chapter 6 simulates the movement of people through an urban area, tracking the individual or population inhalation rate during simulated activities (e.g., shopping, driving, cooking).
      The specific research topics considered in this work are as follows. In the first portion of this dissertation (Chapters 1 – 5), I generate estimates for a summary inhalation metric, called intake fraction, for vehicle emissions in urban areas. In the second portion (Chapters 6 – 7), I first develop a mobility-based GIS inhalation model for urban air pollution, and then, separately, consider how changes in urban population and land area would influence population inhalation of private passenger emissions.
      Intake fraction is the fraction of emissions from some source that are cumulative inhaled by an exposed population. As an example of how intake fraction values might be used, the health effects attributable to an emissions source or source category can be estimated as the product of the mass emission rate, the intake fraction (mass inhaled per mass emitted), and the toxicity (impact per mass inhaled). Intake fraction values will, in general, vary over time and among source categories, source locations, and pollutants. Intake fraction can be used as a potential basis to rank sources when prioritizing emission control strategies. All else being equal, the public health benefit per amount of emission reduced would be larger for an emission source with a large intake fraction than for a source with a small intake fraction.
      In Chapter 1, I provide background and framing for the research. In Chapter 2, I explore the use of intake fraction. This chapter gives examples of how and why intake fraction varies among sources; discusses how this variability may be exploited to increase the health effectiveness of air pollution policy; and, illustrates types of intake and intake fraction analyses one might carry out, depending on the information available.
      In Chapter 3, I provide an estimate of the intake fraction for nonreactive vehicle emissions in California’s South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB). This estimate incorporates several inputs, including (1) measured ambient concentrations of benzene and carbon monoxide (CO), two pollutants that are primarily emitted by motor vehicles; (2) US Census data indicating population densities throughout the SoCAB; (3) time-activity pattern data indicating the amount of time people spend indoors, outdoors, and inside vehicles; (4) microenvironment factors for benzene and CO, which indicate how concentrations may differ in specific microenvironments as compared to the nearby ambient concentration; and (5) the time-varying population-average breathing rate. The annual average intake fraction for nonreactive gaseous vehicle emissions in the SoCAB is estimated as 48 per million, with an uncertainty of ~33%. This value means that 48 g of emissions are collectively inhaled by the population per million g emitted.
      The SoCAB is an important case study, in part because of its large population size (~15 million people, or 1 in 19 US residents). It is also atypical of US urban areas because of its high population density (~860 person km-2) and because of the typically poor air dispersion owing to relatively frequent low inversion heights. In Chapter 4, I estimate the central tendency and main range for the intake fraction of vehicle emissions in urban areas throughout the US. I employ three independent approaches. First, I use a one-compartment mass-balance model of an urban area to combine meteorological data on wind speed and mixing heights with demographic data on urban population and land area. Second, I use a statistical model that relates observed ambient concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) to motor vehicle emission factors for CO. Third, I evaluate model input and output for the US EPA’s National-scale Air Toxics Assessment (NATA), the EPA’s main nationwide air dispersion and exposure model. These approaches incorporate measurements and models, and range in analytic complexity from straightforward to sophisticated. There is broad consistency among the results that these approaches yield. Combining the results of these three investigations, I estimate that the population-weighted annual-average mean intake fraction for nonreactive gaseous vehicle emissions in US urban areas is ~ 14 per million, with a confidence interval of ~ 50%. This value is about three times lower than the intake fraction value of 48 per million estimated for the SoCAB.
      These annual average intake fraction values (48 per million for the SoCAB and 14 per million for the mean value among US urban areas) represent fleet-wide average values. The intake fraction of emissions from a specific vehicle or class of vehicles will, in general, differ from this fleet-wide average. For example, all else being equal, the intake fraction of nonreactive vehicle emissions will be higher if a vehicle operates and emits pollution near population centers (e.g., neighborhood delivery trucks) than if it operates and emits pollution along rural highways. Another reason why intake fraction may differ among vehicles is “self-pollution,” which occurs when a portion of the emissions from a vehicle migrate to inside that vehicle. Experiments were conducted by others, wherein a tracer gas (SF6) was injected at a known flow rate into the exhaust manifold of a school bus, and at the same time concentrations of SF6 were recorded inside the bus. Six buses, representing a range of vehicle ages, were tested with windows open and closed, along actual school bus routes in the SoCAB. In Chapter 5, I analyze results from these tracer gas experiments to estimate children’s school bus self-pollution intake fraction, i.e., the fraction of a school bus’s emissions that are inhaled by students riding on that bus. The average value across the six buses and all bus runs is 27 per million; values were higher with windows closed rather than open, and for older rather than newer buses. When considering the emission from a specific bus, the mass of pollution collectively inhaled by students on that bus is comparable to, and in many cases greater than, the mass of pollution collectively inhaled by all other residents in an urban area.
      In Chapter 6, I develop a GIS-based inhalation model for the SoCAB, and investigate the importance of mobility on estimated inhalation rates for several air pollutants. This investigation represents a new and promising approach for inhalation intake analyses. The four main inputs to the model are (1) spatially and temporally disaggregated estimates of ambient concentrations of specific air pollutants; (2) geo-coded time-location-activity survey data indicating individuals’ location (latitude and longitude) throughout the day; (3) microenvironment factors, which account for differences between the estimated ambient concentration and the exposure concentration attributable to outdoor pollution in locations such as indoors, outdoors, and in-vehicle; and (4) breathing rates, which vary by age, gender, and activity level. Model output is the estimated inhalation intake rate (μg d-1) for each modeled pollutant and each simulated person-day. Results indicate that mobility influences daily intake rates by less than a factor of two for most individuals. I also explore how inhalation intake rates differ among ethnic and income groups. For the five pollutants considered in this chapter, differences in median intake rate vary by 10 – 60% among the four ethnic groups considered (White, Hispanic, African-American, and Asian/Pacific Islander).
      In Chapter 7, I explore the impact of urban population and land area on inhalation intake of vehicle emissions. Changes in population density can impact emissions, owing to changes in average daily distance traveled per person, and also intake fraction, owing to changes in the proximity between people and emissions. The main research question I consider in this chapter is the following: if increasing population density reduces emissions but increases intake fraction, does per capita inhalation intake of vehicle emissions increase or decrease with increasing population density? The research approach employs a one-compartment mass-balance model as an archetypal representation of a hypothetical urban area. This approach clarifies underlying relationships, aids in elucidating causal connections, and permits the problem to be analytically tractable. I find that the impact of population density on inhalation intake of vehicle emissions depends on how much emissions change in response to a change in population density (the “density-emissions elasticity”). To use infill development (i.e., increase population density) to reduce inhalation of vehicle emissions, urban planners must strive to achieve large magnitude density-emissions elasticity values, so that vehicle emissions are significantly reduced by density increases.
      In Chapter 8, I provide a summary of this dissertation, suggestions for future research, and concluding remarks. Overall, this dissertation presents new information and new ways of thinking about the relationship between vehicle emissions and inhalation of these emissions. The tools developed and results presented may be useful in health risk assessment, in policy and economic analyses such as cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses, in considering the goals and impacts of transportation and land-use planning, and in designing effective intervention strategies to reduce the health effects of atmospheric pollutants. The emerging field of exposure science has developed tools, metrics, and approaches that are ready to be integrated more fully into air quality research and management. I make several specific suggestions are made for future investigations. For example, the diurnal profile of population breathing rate is important for determining daily inhalation intake of air pollution, yet there is little information available from which to estimate this parameter. Previous research has explored the influence of urban population density on distance traveled by private passenger vehicles. Given the importance of diesel emissions to air quality and health, this same parameter should be estimated for diesel vehicles.

Rice University football player Ken Simmons
Caption reads: One of KEN SIMMONS’ (class of 1963) favorite exhortations to anyone seeking advice is – “Whatever you do in life, run all the way across the finish line.” Although Simmons’ sport was football and not track, it is a maxim he followed throughout his very successful athletic, academic and business pursuits. As a three-year varsity letterwinner (1960-1962), Simmons has the distinction of playing in two bowl games in one year – the Cotton Bowl (Jan. 1961) and the Bluebonnet Bowl (Dec. 1961). Although football was a major activity for Simmons at Rice, he also served as Treasurer of Will Rice College and Undergraduate Representative to the “R” Association. He pursued academics as diligently as he pursued the goal line, appearing on the President’s Honor Roll more than once, earning his B.A. degree in economics. A serious student throughout his life, Simmons received his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in American Civilization from the University of Texas, where his field of specialization was the role of the business institution in American society. His dissertation, titled Managed Care: Right Idea, Wrong Rules, rules explores the history of the financing of health care in America. After graduating from Rice, Simmons went to work for the Prudential Insurance Company of America, where he rose rapidly in rank. At age 27, he became the youngest vice president in company history. In 1971, he was chosen to lead the company’s Health Maintenance Organization task force, thereby becoming a pioneer in this country’s revolutionary changes in the financing of health care costs, serving on numerous commissions aimed at broadening access to affordable health care for the American public. He was the first President of PruCare, Prudential’s national HMO company, and founder of PruCare-Houston – the first HMO in Texas. In 1985, Simmons became president, CEO and director of Peak HealthCare. His success there led to his appointment as chairman and CEO of United HealthCare Corporation, a Minnesota-based managed care company. As such, he led the company’s turnaround from the brink of bankruptcy to a market value of $2 billion in 1991 and earned the title of HealthCare Executive of the Year in 1989 by the Wall Street Transcript. In 1994, he faced the new challenge of creating a new managed care company. As chairman and CEO of The MetraHealth Companies, Simmons combined business units, corporate cultures and 25,000 employees of MetLife and Travelers to form the country’s largest managed health care company, ever. As a result of his lifelong desire to teach others, Simmons uses his experiences to mentor new CEO’s in the business until their companies are firmly established. Simmons and his wife Judith, also a Rice graduate, seek opportunities to participate in the Rice community and attend Rice football games whenever they can. Simmons has three children: Sean, Rachel and Seth. Rice is pleased to honor Kennett L. Simmons as the Distinguished “R” winner for 1997. Undoubtedly he will continue to find new finish lines to run all the way across.

Multilevel Determinants of Childhood Obesity
The prevalence of obesity among US children and adolescents has rapidly increased in the past several decades, and the epidemic of childhood obesity is currently a serious public health concern in the United States. This dissertation consists of three studies examining individual- and neighborhood-level determinants of childhood obesity. The study area was Los Angeles County in California. Our first study examined the effects of maternal employment, individual socioeconomic status (SES), and neighborhood SES on childhood obesity. The second study not only investigated the independent effect of neighborhood food environment on childhood obesity, but also examined the mediation and moderation effects of household grocery shopping distance on the relationship between neighborhood food environment and childhood obesity. The third study assessed the comparability of two commercial (i.e., InfoUSA and Dun & Bradstreet) and one government (i.e., Los Angeles County Department of Public Health) food environment databases which can be used to measure neighborhood food environment.Our main findings indicated that maternal part-time employment was associated with increased child's BMI, and children's TV-watching time mediated this relationship. In addition, both individual- and neighborhood-level SES measures were inversely associated with childhood obesity. We also found that children living in neighborhoods with lower density of supermarkets and grocery stores or living in neighborhoods with higher density of convenience stores were more likely to have higher BMI. Findings from our comparison study reported that for the InfoUSA vs. Dun & Bradstreet comparison, similarity of counts was high for supermarkets & grocery stores and convenience stores. For Los Angeles County Department of Public Health vs. Dun & Bradstreet comparison, similarity of counts was high for chain supermarkets, independent grocery stores, meat and fish markets, sweets stores, and bakeries; similarity was low for fast-food stores and liquor stores. Census tract characteristics (i.e., median income, percent minority) were associated with levels of similarity across databases. This dissertation identified that maternal part-time employment, individual and neighborhood SES, and neighborhood food environment may be important determinants of childhood obesity. For the measure of neighborhood food environment, the accuracy of secondary data sources remains a considerable issue and additional validation studies are recommended.

Using occupancy to reduce energy consumption of buildings
Buildings account for 73% of the total electricity consumption in the US. To get an in depth view of where this energy is consumed within buildings, we instrument and monitor the buildings at UCSD to study their power consumption patterns. We observe that the energy consumed is not proportional to the occupancy levels of these buildings, thus indicating energy waste. In order to make the power consumption more proportional to its actual usage, we build an occupancy detection system for the CSE building at UCSD. Using this occupancy information as an input, we duty-cycle the different subsystems of the building to save energy. We show that by careful scheduling of the HVAC system based on the occupancy levels, we can reduce their energy consumption by as much as 40%. Further, we have developed the Smart Energy Meter to monitor and actuate plug loads in the building. This allows us to study the energy consumption patterns on a per device basis. Based upon our smart energy meter, we have developed the Energy Auditor, an analysis engine. It provides feedback to the users and building managers by visualizing the energy consumption data, shows them the opportunity to save energy based on the occupancy patterns and also allows the building managers to actuate the plug loads in case of a demand response event

Navigating changing food environments - Transnational perspectives on dietary behaviours and implications for nutrition counselling.
Abstract United States (US) migrants are often characterised as experiencing unhealthy nutrition transitions. 'Looking-back' into dietary behaviours and the processes that affect dietary changes before migration may improve counselling interventions. We conducted a qualitative study of an indigenous Zapotecan transnational community based in Monterey, California, and Oaxaca, Mexico. Four focus groups and 29 interviews were conducted with transnational participants concerning health beliefs around and dietary differences between the US and Oaxaca. Analysis focused on nutrition-related themes. The four major themes were: (1) the paradox between participants' experience growing up with food insecurity and fond memories of a healthier diet; (2) mothers' current kitchen struggles as they contend with changes in food preferences and time demands, and the role 'care packages' play in alleviating these challenges; (3) positive views about home-grown versus store-bought vegetables; and (4) the role of commercial nutritional supplements and the support they provide. Counselling implications include (1) taking a detailed medical/social history to explore experiences with food insecurity and views on the role of nutrition in maintaining health and (2) exploring patients' struggles with different dietary preferences within their families. Transnational experiences may provide new insights for dietary counselling and patient-centred health communication.

Demand for Electric Vehicles in Hybrid Households: An Exploratory Analysis
Previous studies of the potential market for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) have reached contradictory conclusions. What they share are untested or implausible assumptions about consumer response to new transportation technology. We frame the BEV purchase decision in terms of a household's entire stock of vehicles, car purchase behavior and travel behavior. Within this framework, households which own both electric vehicles and gasoline vehicles are called "hybrid households". Because nearly all consumers are unfamiliar with the characteristics of BEVs, we designed an interactive interview based on week-long travel diaries, which we call Purchase Intentions and Range Estimation Games (PIREG) to explore hypothetical hybrid household vehicle use. Our primary finding is that consumers' perceived driving range needs are substantially lower than previous hypothetical stated preference studies conclude. We find evidence of a viable market for BEVs with 60 to 100 miles driving range.

Exposure Assessment of Pesticides and the Effect of Combinations of Pesticides on Parkinson's Disease
Due to the heavy and expanding agricultural use of neurotoxic pesticides suspected to affect dopaminergic neurons, it is imperative to closely examine the role of pesticides in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). We recruited 357 incident PD cases and 752 population-based controls from 2000-2010 in the Central Valley of California and collected demographic, covariate, as well as residential and occupational address information.  We utilized a geographic information system (GIS)-based exposure assessment tool to estimate historical ambient exposure to agricultural pesticides at residential and occupational addresses.Combined exposure to ziram, maneb, and paraquat at workplaces increased risk of PD three-fold and combined exposure to ziram and paraquat, excluding maneb exposure, was associated with an 80% increase in risk. Risk estimates for ambient workplace exposure were greater than exposures at residences and were especially high for younger onset PD patients and when exposed in both locations.  We estimated a greater than two-fold increase in risk of developing PD for participants exposed to organophosphates, organochlorines, dithiocarbamates, and paraquat individually after adjusting for covariates.  However after adjusting for other pesticides, only ambient exposure to organophosphates remained strongly associated, suggesting that pesticides from other classes have a high degree of co-exposure and may require combined exposure to affect PD risk. Longer duration of exposure and co-exposure to a large number of pesticides within the same year were both associated with strong increases in PD risk.Ambient exposure to each organophosphate separately increased the risk of developing PD. However, it is difficult to estimate the risk associated with an individual pesticide due to the likelihood that participants were exposed to combinations of these pesticides rather than any one single pesticide. Combinations of organophosphates with mitochondrial disrupting properties exhibited larger risk increases and exposure-response patterns were observed with exposure to an increasing number of these chemicals.Taken together, our results provide support that ambient co-exposure to pesticides contributes to the etiology of PD.

Differeneces in Brain Responses Between Lean and Obese Women to a Sweetened Drink
Background: Ingestion of sweet food is driven by central reward circuits and restrained by interoceptive satiety signals. Obesity is in part related to an upregulation of these reward mechanisms in association with a downregulation of vagally mediated satiety mechanisms.  The specific influence of sucrose intake on central affective and reward circuitry, and differences in these influences in the obese population is incompletely understood.Hypotheses: 1) Similar brain regions are engaged by the stimulation of sweet taste receptors by sucrose and by non-nutrient sweeteners.  2) During visual food related cues, obese subjects show greater brain responses specifically to sucrose compared to lean controls.Methods: In a two-day, double blind, crossover design, 10 obese and 10 lean healthy females received either a sucrose or a non-nutrient sweetened beverage prior to viewing agreeable food or neutral images.  BOLD signal was measured using a 1.5Tesla MRI scanner. Results: Viewing food images after ingestion of either the sucrose or the non-nutrient drink was associated with engagement of similar brain regions, including the amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, Obese differed from lean subjects in both behavioral and brain responses: While obese subjects rated both beverages as less tasteful and satisfying, they showed greater brain responses. Obese subjects also showed engagement of an additional brain network (including anterior insular and anterior cingulate cortices, hippocampus, amygdala), and this was only seen after sucrose ingestion.Conclusion:  Obese subjects had a reduced behavioral hedonic response yet a greater engagement of affective brain networks in response to food images, particularly after sucrose ingestion. These findings suggests that in obese subjects lingual and gut derived signaling generate less central hedonic effects than recalling memories of food experiences in response to visual cues, analogous to response patterns implicated in food addiction.

Hunger and Food Insecurity among Patients Presenting to an Urban Emergency Department
Introduction: To determine the prevalence of hunger and food insecurity among patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) over 3 consecutive years.
      
         Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of patients presenting to the ED at Hennepin County Medical Center, and urban, Level I trauma center. We prospectively screened adult (age >18) patients presenting to the ED during randomized daily 8-hour periods between June 1 and August 31, 2007 and 2008, and randomized every-other-day periods between June 1 and August 31, 2009. We excluded patients with high acuity complaints, altered mental status, prisoners, those who did not speak Spanish or English, or those considered to be vulnerable. Consenting participants completed a brief demographic survey. The main outcome measures included age, gender, ethnicity, employment, housing status, insurance, access to food, and having to make choices between buying food and buying medicine. All responses were self reported.
      
         Results: 26,211 patients presented during the study; 15,732 (60%) were eligible, 8,044 (51%) were enrolled, and 7,852 (98%) were included in the analysis. The rate of patients reporting hunger significantly increased over the 3-year period 20.3% in 2007, 27.8% in 2008, and 38.3% in 2009 (P < 0.001). The rate of patients reporting ever having to choose between food and medicine also increased 20.0% in 2007, 18.5% in 2008, and 22.6% in 2009 (P = 0.006).
      
         Conclusion: A significant proportion of our ED patients experience food insecurity and hunger. Hunger and food insecurity have become more prevalent among patients seen in this urban county ED over the past 3 years. Emergency physicians should be aware of the increasing number of patients who must choose between obtaining food and their prescribed medications, and should consider the contribution of hunger and food insecurity to the development of health conditions for which ED treatment is sought.

Goethe in Naples: a Morphology of Ordered Chaos
This paper examines J. W. Goethe's morphological description of Naples from a spatial perspective involving the intersection of phenomenology, geology, geography, and culture. This analysis is based on Goethe's legendary travelogue Journey to Italy 1786-1788 and aims at extricating problems inherent in the description of a complex space, such as a city. This study takes as its point of departure Goethe's theorization of the Primal Plant and his reflections on Homer, which inform his morphology in significant ways. Naples is the concrete object of this analysis of the urban space, but the observation included in this essay can be applied to other cities, particularly in the context of the Mediterranean.

Characteristics of translocation and remobilization of zinc absorbed from different stages into grain in dense rice genotype using a stable isotope tracing technique
Zinc (Zn) is an essential micronutrient for plant and human, and over 40% of children in the world are suffering from Zn malnutrition. Zinc deficiency in human is mainly caused from low Zn concentration and bioavailability in foods or edible parts of crop plants. Biofortification appears to be a most sustainable and cost-effective approach to solve human micronutrient malnutrition. Zinc deficiency is a widespread problem in rice, causing decreased crop yields and nutritional quality. Increasing Zn density in rice grain is important for improving crop yield and human nutrition. Large genotypic differences in Zn concentration in rice grains have been observed, however, the mechanisms of Zn dense acumulation in rice grain is not fully understood. In this paper, 68Zn stable isotope tracing technique was used to compare the translocation of 68Zn absorbed at different growth stages to grain and Zn remobilization between Zn-dense and Zn-indense rice genotype. The results showed that the Zn-dense rice genotype (IR68144) had greater translocation of 68Zn absorbed during early (from seedling to tillering stage) and late (from grain filling to harvest stage)growth stages, as compared with the indense genotype (IR64). More than half of Zn distributed in grains was translocated from those absorbed by rice plant before anthesis, accounting for 63% and 52% of the total for IR68144 and IR64, respectively. Even after grain filling, plenty of Zn could be transported into grains, with a two fold higher distribution rate to brown rice for IR68144 than for IR64. The Zn-indense rice genotype IR64 contained more 68Zn in roots whereas the Zn-dense rice genotype IR68144 contained more 68Zn in stems, leaves, and grains when 68Zn was supplied at all stages. The remobilization of 68Zn within the plant varied greatly between the two genotypes. When stopping 68Zn supplying at tillering stage, we found that more 68Zn was retranslocated into the new growing leaves and tillers, and more 68Zn was exported from the full-expanded leaf in the dense genotype than in the indense genotype. When stopping 68Zn supply at Anthesis stage, it was observed that more 68Zn was retranslocated into the growing grain, and more 68Zn remobilized from stem and flag leaf in IR68144 than in IR64. The retranslocation of 68Zn from the flag leaf to grain was found to be twice greater in IR68144 than in IR64 when applying 68Zn on the flag leaf either at booting stage or anthesis stage. These results indicated that the Zn-density in rice grain is closely associated with the ability of Zn translocation from “the source” to “the sink” at both early and late growth stages and phloem mobility of Zn, especially from stem to grain.

WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic 2011: Warning about the dangers of tobacco
The number of people now protected by tobacco control measures is growing at a remarkable pace. The progress made on adopting measures that reduce the demand for tobacco is a sign of the increasing impact of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which continues to be one of the most rapidly embraced, measurably successful treaties in United Nations history.This report, the third periodic country-level examination of the global tobacco epidemic, identifies the countries that have taken effective tobacco control measures that save lives. These countries can be held up as models of action for the many countries that need to do more to protect their people from the harms of tobacco use. Tobacco continues to kill nearly 6 million people each year, including more than 600 000 non-smokers who die from exposure to tobacco smoke. Up to half of the world s 1 billion smokers will eventually die of a tobacco-related disease. However, we have the power to change these circumstances.The focus of this report is on warning people about the harms of tobacco use. People have an inherent right to receive this information, and countries have an obligation to provide it. The two main types of warnings are examined: health warning labels on tobacco packages and national anti-tobacco mass media campaigns. Large and graphic warning labels and hard-hitting mass media campaigns have proven effective in reducing tobacco use and encouraging people to quit. This report presents for the first time detailed national-level data collected on a global basis for anti-tobacco mass media campaigns.

Animal Cognition in Relation to Farm Animal Welfare:  The Need for a Different Approach
Reviewing various ideas about animal cognition, including the radically different approach developed by Maturana and Varela (1987), brings to light serious concerns about  the ability of the current science of cognitive ethology to address issues of animal welfare or to provide useful interpretations of animal thinking and awareness. The proposition that farm animal welfare will be properly assessed only when much more is known about the cognitive abilities of the animals concerned is critically discussed. This principle is supported, but the current means of achieving it are questioned.  It is argued that a broader scientific basis is needed to enhance a cognitive ethology  that is merely an additive combination of behavioural observation and information-processing models of cognition.

Research on sexual and condom use behaviors in the Botswana Defence Force
Background : Studies show inconsistent condom use is relatively common among military personnel. In an effort to increase condom use among soldiers, an intervention was implemented to examine the effects of condom scent and wrapper graphics on usage in the Botswana Defence Force (BDF). Current condom use behaviors and correlates of lower condom use were characterized, and differences in reporting behaviors from a retrospective survey and a prospective diary were also examined. Methods : From October 2010-April 2011, 211 sexually-active male BDF soldiers, aged 18-30, participated in the study. Participants at four military bases received condoms in a plain blue or camouflage wrapper, either scented or unscented. A baseline survey collected demographics and HIV risk behaviors. Pre- and post-intervention behaviors were measured with two diaries each. A retrospective survey was administered immediately after the post- intervention diaries, which queried participants about behaviors as reported in those diaries. Several participants were also randomly selected to participate in focus group sessions which included discussions about condoms, condom use, and reporting of sexual behaviors. Results : Only 51% of participants reported always using condoms at baseline. Lower condom use was associated with excessive alcohol use, reported trust for a sexual partner, and the perception that condoms make sex less enjoyable. Scented condoms and condoms packaged in a camouflage wrapper were found to increase condom use rates in the BDF. Most sexual behaviors reported in the survey and diary were similar, with the exception of behaviors associated with having a regular partner, reports of exchanging material goods for sex with a casual partner, and reports of some retrospective condom use categories. Conclusions : HIV interventions aimed at increasing condom use in the BDF should address alcohol abuse, beliefs about condoms, and issues of trust. The BDF should consider providing scented condoms and condoms packaged in a camouflage wrapper, coupled with messages of correct and consistent condom use, which may help increase usage. Results suggest that retrospective surveys are useful for measuring recent sexual behaviors, although prospective diaries may be more reliable in collecting routine and sensitive sexual practices in the BDF

A Critical Analysis of Technological Innovation and Economic Development in Southern California's Urban Water Reuse And Recycling Industry
Southern California's urbanization was accomplished through the technologically-aided harvesting of faraway water sources. Today this is too expensive, environmentally damaging, and politically unpopular. Southern California utilities have begun shifting to a strategy of conservation and the development of local sources such as groundwater, desalination, or recycled water. Progressive local water agencies have built advanced water reuse infrastructure projects like Orange County Water District's (OCWD) Groundwater Replenishment System (GWRS), the world's largest and most technologically advanced indirect potable reuse project. At the same time, the region has been mired in a prolonged multiyear economic downturn, leading many observers to advocate economic development through nurturing environmentally sensitive "clean tech" industries. This thesis investigates the Southern California water industry and, specifically, the regional innovation system that has generated major breakthroughs in water reuse technology and infrastructure that has come about due to OCWD's--and others'--early investment in reuse research. Using an analytical framework derived from economic agglomeration scholarship, innovation systems literature, and an international case study analysis of the water technology innovation systems of Israel, Singapore, Netherlands, and Australia, this study employs qualitative interviews, industry analysis, and a case study of the GWRS project to investigate the regional water industry. It finds a strong local industry--often led by a forward looking state government--with auspicious growth prospects, but with significant local impediments including overly fragmented markets and consumers, hidden price subsidies, confusing legal institutions, agencies with misaligned incentives, lackluster private industry regional promotion, and unproductive interagency competition. Today other regions throughout the world, even neighboring Northern California, are rapidly growing their water technology expertise--occasionally at the expense of Southern California. More effective regional governance and better private sector cooperation would further strengthen the region's already robust industry, accelerate the local creation of technological innovation, and manage limited regional water supplies more effectively.

The Ideal Source of Local Public Revenue
Free or underpriced curb parking creates a classic commons problem. Studies have found that between 8% and 74% of cars in congested traffic were cruising in search of curb parking, and that the average time to find a curb space ranged between 3 and 14 min. Cities can eliminate the economic incentive to cruise by charging market-clearing prices for curb parking spaces. Market-priced curb parking can yield between 5% and 8% of the total land rent in a city, and in some neighborhoods can yield more revenue than the property tax.

The Food System and a Role for Ecological Ethics
This paper analyzes the contemporary food system using ethical philosophy, in hopes that this may help elucidate how to move forward in righting a system that leaves a wake of hunger, obesity, and environmental degradation.  I have chosen to focus on the work of Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess, concentrating on his ecological ethics because of the way in which agriculture represents the meeting of, and blurring between, the human and the natural realms.  My research first involved a survey of popular and academic works on the contemporary food system, focusing on broader analyses of political-economy, human and environmental impacts, and historical development.  My research also involved a survey of Arne Naess’s work, from his earlier writings and articulation of Deep Ecology in the middle of the 20th century until his death in 2009.  My research found that the main obstacle to building a more just food system is not a lack of ethical clarity, but rather the structural barriers of the capitalist economic system.  I argue that ecological ethics must be a catalyst for systematic change, and that the possibility of the immediate realization of an ecological ethos is quite limited within the current political-economic system.

Using Embryonic Stem Cells as a Novel Model to Compare the Toxicological Effects of Harm Reduction and Conventional Cigarette Smoke on Early Embryo Development
Embryonic stem cells are derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) of blastocysts. Before implantation, cells in the ICM undergo multiple divisions, and after implantation, the entire ICM develops into the embryo. Here, we are interested in the effects of environmental toxicants, such as cigarette smoke, on blastocysts during pre-implantation development.  Our lab used mouse and human embryonic stem cells (mESC, hESC) as a pre-implantation model to examine the effects of mainstream (MS) or sidestream (SS) smoke from conventional (Marlboro Red) and harm reduction (Advance Lights, Quest, and Marlboro Lights) cigarettes on early development. Harm reduction tobacco products, contain genetically modified tobacco to produce lower nicotine concentration or are equipped with advanced filters designed to remove carcinogens.  These products are often advertised as safer with fewer toxins.  In our mESC study, stem cells were cultured in suspension with cigarette smoke solutions and allowed to attach over 24 hours.  All brands tested inhibited mESC attachment, survival, and proliferation, and surprisingly, harm reduction cigarette smoke was more potent than conventional smoke (Lin et al., 2009). To further investigate the effects of cigarette products on human embryos, hESC colonies were treated with conventional and harm reduction cigarette smoke solutions for 48 hours.  To overcome technical challenges with the hESC system, BioStation technology combined with video bioinformatics tools was used to develop assays based time-lapse video data of dynamic cellular processes (Lin, et al., 2010). This technology was used to quantify hESC colony attachment and growth in various smoke treatments. Data demonstrated that non-cytotoxic doses of conventional and harm reduction cigarette SS smoke impaired hESC colony attachment and growth significantly, but MS smoke did not. Moreover, hESC were more sensitive in most assays than mESC.  Most significantly, for both species in all assays, SS smoke from harm reduction cigarettes was more potent than SS smoke from a conventional brand. This study clearly demonstrates the need to monitor harm reduction products carefully and to evaluate both MS and SS smoke emitted from them.

Hunger and Food Insecurity among Patients Presenting to an Urban Emergency Department
Introduction:To determine the prevalence of hunger and food insecurity among patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) over 3 consecutive years.
      Methods:This was a cross-sectional study of patients presenting to the ED at Hennepin County Medical Center, and urban, Level I trauma center. We prospectively screened adult (age >18) patients presenting to the ED during randomized daily 8-hour periods between June 1 and August 31, 2007 and 2008, and randomized every-other-day periods between June 1 and August 31, 2009. We excluded patients with high acuity complaints, altered mental status, prisoners, those who did not speak Spanish or English, or those considered to be vulnerable. Consenting participants completed a brief demographic survey. The main outcome measures included age, gender, ethnicity, employment, housing status, insurance, access to food, and having to make choices between buying food and buying medicine. All responses were self reported.
      Results:26,211 patients presented during the study; 15,732 (60%) were eligible, 8,044 (51%) were enrolled, and 7,852 (98%) were included in the analysis. The rate of patients reporting hunger significantly increased over the 3-year period 20.3% in 2007, 27.8% in 2008, and 38.3% in 2009 (p<0.001). The rate of patients reporting ever having to choose between food and medicine also increased 20.0% in 2007, 18.5% in 2008, and 22.6% in 2009 (p=0.006).
      Conclusion:A significant proportion of our ED patients experience food insecurity and hunger. Hunger and food insecurity have become more prevalent among patients seen in this urban county ED over the past 3 years. Emergency physicians should be aware of the increasing number of patients who must choose between obtaining food and their prescribed medications, and should consider the contribution of hunger and food insecurity to the development of health conditions for which ED treatment is sought.

Study of the thermochemistry for oxygen production for a solar sulfur-ammonia
The purpose of this study was to investigate the oxygen sub-cycle of a solar- thermochemical water-splitting cycle for hydrogen production. The study focuses on the thermal decomposition of molten salts in a sulfur-ammonia cycle, which evolves ammonia and SO₃ in two reactors. The molten salts proposed are a mixture of (NH₄)₂SO₄, K₂SO₄, K₂S₂O7, Na₂SO₄, and Na₂S₂O7. For this cycle to work, the salts must remain liquid with low viscosity for pumping, and ammonia and SO₃ must be released separately. Therefore, melting temperatures and the viscosity of various salt mixtures were measured. Thermogravimetric, differential thermal (TG/DTA), residual gas (RGA), and chemical analyses were employed to study the salt decomposition. The mixtures of K₂SO₄+4K₂S₂O7+Na₂SO₄+ 4Na₂S₂O7 and K₂SO₄+ 9K₂S₂O7+Na₂SO₄+ 9Na₂S₂O7 with melting temperatures 343±11°C and 332±7.8°C, respectively, would be appropriate for the streams between the reactors. The TG/ DTA showed that (NH₄)₂SO₄+2K₂SO₄+8K₂S₂O7 decomposition resulted in separate ammonia (269°C) and SO₃ release (373°C). The RGA data for (NH₄)₂SO₄+K₂SO₄+4K₂S₂O7+Na₂SO₄+ 4Na₂S₂O7 decomposition suggested that 25°C separated the end of ammonia (475°C) and the start of SO₃ release (500°C). This was confirmed by monitoring the pH of a solution through which the evolved gas was bubbled. The mass balance experiment showed that, when held at 475°C for 60 minutes, 21% of the ammonia expected to be evolved was released. The addition of 10g of water to 2g of salt mixtures resulted in 58% of the ammonia expected being released. The viscosity of K₂SO₄+4K₂S₂O7+Na₂SO₄+4Na₂S₂O7 and K₂SO₄+9K₂S₂O7+Na₂SO₄+9Na₂S₂O7 ranged from 2.6cP to 9.3cP between 393°C and 510°C, which means that they could be pumped

Evaluation of a Fresh Fruit Distribution Program in an Ethnically Diverse San Francisco High School
Objectives. We evaluated the effects of a Department of Education Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) on food consumption habits in an inner-city, San Francisco high school. Methods. One intervention high school received a California state grant from the Department of Education to distribute fruit biweekly from fall 2008 to spring 2010 and coordinate associated nutrition education. Students completed 1793 surveys at the intervention school and 778 surveys at a comparison school that assessed fruit, vegetable, fast food and soda consumption habits. Pearson's chi-squared tests were used to compare consumption of foods. Results. At the end of the intervention period, the percentage of students consuming soft drinks once or more per day was significantly lower in the intervention versus comparison school (3.1% versus 8.9%, p = 0.01). Consumption of candy once or more per week was also lower in the intervention versus the comparison school in fall 2009 (55.7% versus 64.0%, p = 0.01). No significant changes in fruit and vegetable consumption were observed in the intervention or comparison schools.

Erythrocyte Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency mutation identified in multiple breeds of domestic cats
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Erythrocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency (PK deficiency) is an inherited hemolytic anemia that has been documented in the Abyssinian and Somali breeds as well as random bred domestic shorthair cats. The disease results from mutations in PKLR, the gene encoding the regulatory glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK). Multiple isozymes are produced by tissue-specific differential processing of PKLR mRNA. Perturbation of PK decreases erythrocyte longevity resulting in anemia. Additional signs include: severe lethargy, weakness, weight loss, jaundice, and abdominal enlargement. In domestic cats, PK deficiency has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance with high variability in onset and severity of clinical symptoms.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					Sequence analysis of PKLR revealed an intron 5 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position 304 concordant with the disease phenotype in Abyssinian and Somali cats. Located 53 nucleotides upstream of the exon 6 splice site, cats with this SNP produce liver and blood processed mRNA with a 13 bp deletion at the 3&#8217; end of exon 5. The frame-shift mutation creates a stop codon at amino acid position 248 in exon 6. The frequency of the intronic SNP in 14,179 American and European cats representing 38 breeds, 76 western random bred cats and 111 cats of unknown breed is 6.31% and 9.35% when restricted to the 15 groups carrying the concordant SNP.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					PK testing is recommended for Bengals, Egyptian Maus, La Perms, Maine Coon cats, Norwegian Forest cats, Savannahs, Siberians, and Singapuras, in addition to Abyssinians and Somalis as well an any new breeds using the afore mentioned breeds in out crossing or development programs.

Trichloroethene Removal From Waste Gases in Anaerobic Biotrickling Filters  Through Reductive Dechlorination
Trichloroethene (TCE) is a persistent soil and groundwater pollutant that is known to be toxic to humans. Ex situ treatment is currently considered the most viable option for remediation of TCE contaminated sites. Among ex situ techniques, soil vapor extraction (SVE) and dual-phase extraction (DPE) with air sparging are more attractive since they result in rapid remediation of sites. However, waste gas streams laden with TCE are thus generated, and these require treatment. While traditionally this has been done using incineration or adsorption onto activated carbon, in this dissertation it is proposed that treatment of waste gases containing TCE can be carried out in anaerobic biological reactors, after displacement of oxygen during SVE or DPE with nitrogen. These anaerobic bioreactors rely on the metabolism of novel microorganisms from the Dehalococcoides genus that reductively dechlorinate TCE all the way to non-toxic ethene via cis-1,2,-dichloroethene (cis-DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC), in combination with oxidation of hydrogen.For providing the proof of concept of anaerobic TCE waste gas treatment, a lab-scale anaerobic biotrickling filter inoculated with a mixed culture containing Dehalococcoides spp. that harbor the TceA and VcrA reductive dehalogenases was setup and monitored for performance. A biotrickling filter configuration was chosen since it gives an easy means of providing lactate as an indirect source of hydrogen to Dehalococcoides spp. immobilized on the bed packing through its fermentation. TCE elimination capacities (EC) higher than those reported for aerobic gas-phase bioreactors treating TCE were observed. The distribution of the intermediates of TCE dechlorination was significantly affected by the recirculating liquid pH, with near neutral pHs resulting in the maximum conversion of removed TCE to ethene (>60% at loadings of 3 gTCE mbed-3 h-1). Because complete conversion to ethene was not observed, a detailed modeling study followed focusing on the determination of biokinetic constants for the dechlorination of TCE, cis-DCE and VC as well as any inhibition that may exist between these compounds. Dechlorination data from experiments with differential reactor operation with single compounds only were fitted to the model to determine biokinetic constants. Experiments with multiple compounds were used to determine inhibition between various compounds. It was found that the Michaelis-Menten constants for all compounds were higher than when grown typically in suspended cultures (i.e. lower enzyme affinity). It was also observed that TCE competitively inhibits the dechlorination of cis-DCE, and also has an effect on the dechlorination of VC, suggesting that some modification to the process culture could alter the distribution of the intermediates. To test the hypothesis that addition of a strain containing a different reductive dehalogenase (BvcA, responsible for dechlorination of cis-DCE and VC) could result in better conversion of TCE to ethene, a biotrickling filter inoculated with the original culture used and operating at high loads (8-9 gTCE mbed-3 h-1), was bioaugmented with Dehalococcoides sp. strain BAV1 that contains the BvcA enzyme. It was found that conversion of TCE to ethene was improved significantly (from <10% of removed TCE to 45%) after bioaugmentation. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and reverse transcript qPCR analysis revealed that not only strain BAV1 was able to grow, but that the expression of bvcA genes was also very high. Finally, the rate-limiting step after long-term operation of the biotrickling filters was evaluated after it was found that there was a rapid decrease in the reactor efficacy following excessive biomass growth. It was found that mass transfer limitations as a result of decrease in specific surface area of the packing from excessive biomass growth existed. Depending on the gas and the liquid flow rates, this limitation was either at the gas or the liquid films. Mass transfer limitations were confirmed by omission of the recirculating liquid, which resulted in higher ECs, suggesting that after significant biomass build-up, careful considered of possible mass transfer limitations is warranted. Overall, the present study provides the foundations for a possible new technique for remediation of TCE contaminated sites.

Outdoor advertising, obesity, and soda consumption: a cross-sectional study
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Recent research has shown that neighborhood characteristics are associated with obesity prevalence. While food advertising in periodicals and television has been linked to overweight and obesity, it is unknown whether outdoor advertising is related to obesity.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					To test the association between outdoor food advertising and obesity, we analyzed telephone survey data on adults, aged 18&#8211;98, collected from 220 census tracts in Los Angeles and Louisiana. We linked self-reported information on BMI and soda consumption with a database of directly observed outdoor advertisements.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					The higher the percentage of outdoor advertisements promoting food or non-alcoholic beverages within a census tract, the greater the odds of obesity among its residents, controlling for age, race and educational status. For every 10% increase in food advertising, there was a 1.05 (95% CI 1.003 - 1.093, p&lt;0.03) greater odds of being overweight or obese, controlling for other factors. Given these predictions, compared to an individual living in an area with no food ads, those living in areas in which 30% of ads were for food would have a 2.6% increase in the probability of being obese.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					There is a relationship between the percentage of outdoor food advertising and overweight/obesity.

Examining contextual settings to explain gender differences in cigarette and alcohol use among Asian immigrants : work, hospitality venues, and household settings
Among Asian immigrants to the U.S., less acculturated males but more acculturated females report higher present and predicted future rates of smoking. These findings were based on cross-sectional data. Our longitudinal study among Koreans in California (CA) tested the hypothesis that increased acculturation to the CA environment would increase social acceptability to smoke among females but simultaneously apply social pressure against smoking among males. Our findings revealed that increased acculturation was not statistically related to uptake in household smoking bans or changes to smoking and quitting rates. However, increased years in CA significantly increased implementation of complete household smoking bans among both genders, significantly reduced smoking and increased quitting among Korean males and positively increased smoking, but not significantly in multivariate analyses, among Korean females. Conclusions drawn from these and other studies suggest the need to study the specific social contingencies that are operating and how these differ between the genders to produce the divergent trajectories of smoking prevalence. This dissertation will examine three separate, contextual settings that may influence smoking prevalence and exposure among Asian immigrants in California. The three settings include the work environment, the hospitality venues of restaurant and bars, and the dynamic household and employment contingencies. Data were gathered from different funding sources, at different time points and include different Asian immigrants. However, data collection methodologies were similar across all studies. Telephone calls were conducted with adults in California who had an Asian surname. The first dataset was collected in 2001-2003 and resulted in a representative sample of 2,830 Koreans in California age 18 and older. This sample was re- interviewed in 2005-2006 and 2007-200913. During the 2005- 2006 wave, a second representative sample (n=2,085) of Koreans was collected in parallel to the first sample and was also re-interviewed in 2007-2009. In 2010, a new study was funded to generate two new representative samples of adults age 21 and over in California who immigrated from either Korea or China/Taiwan. Data collection is currently in progress with 1,739 interviews completed to date

Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and sodium-rich foods are increasingly becoming commonplace in the diets of American children and adolescents. Aside from the well-characterized health outcomes such as obesity and diabetes, these foods pose direct risks in terms of increasing the likelihood of dental caries, elevated uric acid, and hypertension in children and adolescents as well as displacing foods necessary to healthy growth and development. The following two-part review examines consumption of sweetened beverages and sodium-rich foods in relationship to associations with immediate and long-term health effects, describes population subgroups that are especially susceptible, and proposes policy and individual-level prevention strategies.

Growth and Stewardship: Frank Zwart's Four Decades at UC Santa Cruz
Francis Frank M. Zwart III arrived at the University of California, Santa Cruz as a student at Cowell College in 1967, when the campus was a mere two years old and the students were “walking across planks where pipe trenches were still open.” Zwart graduated in mathematics from UCSC and boarded a train east to study architecture at Princeton University, where he matriculated in 1976. After graduation, Zwart worked with architectural firms in Princeton, Los Angeles, Santa Monica, Aptos, California, Philadelphia, and Carmel before returning to UC Santa Cruz in 1985 as a staff architect and project manager. Thus he commenced a long and distinguished career at UCSC that spanned the tenures of seven UCSC chancellors. Zwart became Campus Architect in 1988 and directed UCSC’s Office of Physical Planning & Construction (PP&C) until his retirement in April 2010. From 1999 until 2010 he also held the title of Associate Vice Chancellor for Physical Planning & Construction. This 420-page oral history is the result of nine recorded interviews and documents Zwart’s experience during over four decades at UC Santa Cruz—from his years as an undergraduate during the late 1960s, when the campus gained national attention as a prestigious and visionary experiment in public higher education, to his career as Campus Architect during UCSC’s expansion into a major research university.

Towards an understanding of phosphate &#948;<super>18</super>O in the bones and scales of small pelagic fish
Oxygen isotope ratios of fish biominerals reflect environmental growth conditions - specifically, the temperature and &#948;<super>18</super>O values of water.  In Holocene ocean sediments, phosphate &#948;<super>18</super>O (&#948;<super>18</super>O<sub>P</sub>) values of small pelagic fish bones and scales can be coupled with abundance data to study connections between past climate and population dynamics.  This requires the detection of decadal scale climate variability via precise isotope measurements.  To accomplish this, isotope data is best corrected by multiple regression methods that facilitate both instrumental monitoring and correction model optimization.  Our measurements of &#948;<super>18</super>O values from bones, scales, and otoliths indicated that all three materials provide similar information about growth conditions, provided that each material's unique allometry is considered.  For sardines cultured at controlled temperatures, &#948;<super>18</super>O<sub>P</sub> values of scales were consistent with the fractionation equation proposed by Longinelli and Nuti (1973).  These results support the use of &#948;<super>18</super>O<sub>P</sub> to investigate the paleoecology of small pelagic fish.

Accumulation and Metabolism of Halogenated Compounds in Sea Turtles
All sea turtle populations face the risk of extinction.  Of the threats to sea turtles, the effects of environmental chemicals are the least understood. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are toxic, persistent, ubiquitous, anthropogenic halogenated organic contaminants (HOCs).  While anthropogenic HOCs are notorious for their toxicity, exposure to naturally produced HOCs, many of which exist in the marine environment, may also cause adverse effects.  The purpose of this dissertation was to gain insight into possible impacts of HOCs on the health of sea turtle populations by assessing biotransformation enzymes, as well as the accumulation and metabolism of HOCs in several species of sea turtles- loggerhead (<italic>Caretta caretta</italic>), green (<italic>Chelonia mydas</italic>), olive ridley (<italic>Lepidochelys olivacea</italic>), and hawksbill (<italic>Eretmochelys imbricata</italic>). The results showed that sea turtle livers possess the biotransformation enzymes cytochrome P450 (CYP) and glutathione S-transferase (GST).  Western blots revealed CYP2- and CYP3-like proteins, but do not CYP1A-like proteins.  Spectrophotometric assays indicated that sea turtles showed similar GST kinetic parameters, but inter- and intra-species variation in activities towards GST class-specific substrates.  PCBs accumulated in the livers of sea turtles, with levels ranging from 5-25 ng/g, as measured by gas chromatography with electron capture detection. In vitro incubations of sea turtle liver microsomes with 2,2',5,5'-tetrachlorinated biphenyl (PCB 52) indicated the formation a hydroxylated metabolite by liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy, while incubations with 3,3'4,4'-tetrachlorinated biphenyl (PCB 77) did not reveal metabolites. Taken together, these results supported a model in which rates of hepatic biotransformation may determine elimination and relative concentrations of PCBs in reptilian tissues.Hawksbill sea turtles feed primarily on marine sponges, which produce natural HOCs, such as 4,5-dibromopyrrole-2-carboxylic acid (DBPC), as deterrents against predation. The lack of detectable in vitro metabolism of DBPC by hawksbill sea turtles, as measured by liquid chromatography with radioactivity detection, indicated that biotransformation may not be the primary mechanism of tolerance to natural dietary. Kinetic analysis of spectrophotmetric assays indicated non-substrate binding of DBPC by GST, which suggested potential protection from sponge HOCs via GST transport or sequestration. The information in this dissertation provides critical knowledge to connect toxic effects of HOCs to sea turtle population decline.

Aspects of the Biology and the Effects of Traditional and Non-Traditional Insecticides on Citrus Thrips and Avocado Thrips with the Objective of Improving Integrated Pest Management
Citrus thrips, <italic>Scirtothrips citri</italic> (Moulton), is a plant-feeding pest most widely recognized for damage caused to citrus and mango fruits.  Citrus thrips have also become a significant pest in California's blueberries.  Avocado thrips, <italic>Scirtothrips perseae</italic> Nakahara, is a pest of avocados (<italic>Persea americana</italic> Mill. Lauraceae) in California.  Pesticides are often used to manage these two species of thrips and therefore, the likelihood of resistance development is high.  There is increasing pressure in the United States to move away from broad-spectrum insecticides and focus on alternative methods of control, e.g., genetically modified crop plants expressing Bt (<italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic>) toxins, use of biorational insecticides such as toxic Bt protein sprays and entomopathogens (such as various strains of <italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic> Balsamo, and other agents).  Integrated pest management programs are essential for any agricultural commodity.  The goal of the work described here is to add to the foundation of knowledge to improve the integrated pest management of citrus thrips and avocado thrips.  The research conducted for this disseration 1) examined alternatives to traditional insecticides (Bt protein sprays and several strains of <italic>B. bassiana</italic>) to control both avocado and citrus thrips in the laboratory and resulted in no efficacy of the Bts tested but one strain of fungus, the commercially available strain was able to infect citrus thrips at field obtainable levels, 2) tested the commercially available strain in different formulations and water regimes against citrus thrips in blueberry fields which resulted in some control but not enough to strongly recommend this as an alternative to traditional pesticides, 3) evaluated the impact of some of the insecticides registered for avocado thrips management on the beneficial native predaceous mite <italic>Euseius hibisci</italic> Chant in avocado orchards and found that each of the pesticides harmed the mite but at varying levels and durations, 4) assessed citrus thrips oviposition on blueberry varieties with choice and no-choice tests and it was determined that citrus thrips likely oviposit to differing degrees in some plants over others, and finally 5) determined that citrus thrips in the Americas was actually a complex of species that were nearly morphologically identical but molecularly quite distinct.

Taste is Within: Decorative Material Culture at Home in Los Angeles and Lima, Peru
Influential scholars such as Pierre Bourdieu theorize that, because people practice unyielding habitus, members of the same class strata have similar taste and consume art objects reflective of this. In this dissertation, I address the relationships between art that is on display in the homes of 48 families (representing their taste preferences) and a range of economic and social variables. The sample consists of contemporary middle-class households - 32 in Los Angeles, California, and 16 in Lima, Peru. Methodologically, I employ quantitative and qualitative techniques inspired by sociocultural and ethnoarchaeological anthropology. I test several subsets of hypotheses involving such factors as quantity and placement of objects in the homes, socioeconomic status, marital satisfaction, gendered and age-based preference, and socialization of children toward that preference. I also explore the meanings family members ascribe to these artifacts. Photographic and videographic data-gathering methods allow me to examine all of the decorative objects displayed in the houses' most publicly visible spaces. I use cultural consensus modeling, including semantic analyses of open-ended interviews and a new visual preference-ranking technique, to determine congruence between people's tastes. Among the patterns emerging from the analyses, even non-utilitarian household objects reflect homeowners' cultural capital, but class, and the cultural capital upon which it partially depends, is but one variable contributing to people's relationship with their household aesthetic. Some people who self-identify as middle-class consume art that some would consider "fine;" others do not. I posit that taste does not correlate with class as class is traditionally construed. Self-identified middle-class Angelenos and Limeños are not fixed in a habituated aesthetic based on such factors as income or power. Rather, they select from options that are increasing in availability with the rapid global flow of objects and ideas.

Multi-criteria comparison of fuel policies: Renewable fuel mandate, fuel emission-standards, and fuel carbon tax
We develop a two-region partial equilibrium model of the global market for liquid fuels to analyze different fuel policies based on multiple criteria, including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, expenditure of fuel imports, and the impact on fuel consumers and producers. We find that while ethanol policies may lower gasoline price in the home region, they increase the price of other oil products. A carbon tax increases prices of all fuels. For current sources of ethanol, reduction in GHG emissions due to the substitution of gasoline with ethanol in domestic markets may be dominated by the increase the global emissions because of price effects. Policy makers' preference for ethanol mandates reveals a desire to lower the cost of gasoline and to support the domestic biofuel sector while the selection of an emission-standard reveals a desire to reduce GHG emissions and minimize the impact on fuel consumers.

The United States
Nearly 18 per cent of US GNP is spent on transportation, with about one-half of that amount accounted for by cars and related equipment and infrastructure. This is down slightly from its 20 per cent GNP share held over most of the period following the Second World War, a reduction that has been attributed principally to recent economic deregulation of the for-hire industries. Transportation also constitutes a major part of business investments, representing about 13 per cent of total expenditure on new plant and equipment. In addition, transportation is a major consumer of other industries' products, accounting for some 70 per cent of the rubber, 64 per cent of the petroleum, and a quarter of the steel and cement produced (TPA, 1988; see also Deakin and Garrison, 1986).
      Trends in mileage since 1982 have been mixed. Airways have grown to some 381,084 miles; highways have also increased, more slowly, to 714,255 miles in the federal-aid classifications. Intercity bus routes have been cut back sharply, while urban transit services have been trimmed in some areas but expanded elsewhere for little net change. Petroleum pipeline mileage decreased somewhat, and inland waterway mileages have grown only marginally. The rail system lost another 17,000 miles, bringing its mileage to less than two-thirds of that in 1945 (TPA).

Jim Pepper and the Evolution of Environmental Studies at UC Santa Cruz: An Oral History
Recruited by the visionary geographer Richard Dick Cooley to join the new environmental studies program at UCSC, Pepper arrived in Santa Cruz in 1972. This oral history is part of the Regional History Project's VERIP series with professors who retired in the early 1990s. In these two interviews conducted by former Regional History director Randall Jarrell and current director Irene Reti, Jim Pepper describes UCSC's environmental studies program as one that “had both a theoretical dimension to it and an applied dimension, a program . . . that integrated theory and practice.” Pepper brought to this nascent department his practical experience and background as a professional landscape architect and planner, as well as his probing interest in the philosophical and ethical questions at the heart of environmental issues. Between 1972 and his retirement in 1994, Jim Pepper helped to build a flagship program in environmental studies at UCSC. Outside of academia, Jim Pepper has enjoyed a 45-year distinguished career in environmental planning, site planning, and urban design. His projects included the formulation of an earthquake recovery plan for downtown Santa Cruz after the Loma Prieta Earthquake of 1989.

Development of an invasively monitored porcine model of acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure
Abstract
Background
The development of effective therapies for acute liver failure (ALF) is limited by our knowledge of the pathophysiology of this condition, and the lack of suitable large animal models of acetaminophen toxicity. Our aim was to develop a reproducible invasively-monitored porcine model of acetaminophen-induced ALF.

Method
35kg pigs were maintained under general anaesthesia and invasively monitored. Control pigs received a saline infusion, whereas ALF pigs received acetaminophen intravenously for 12 hours to maintain blood concentrations between 200-300 mg/l. Animals surviving 28 hours were euthanased.

Results
Cytochrome p450 levels in phenobarbital pre-treated animals were significantly higher than non pre-treated animals (300 vs 100 pmol/mg protein). Control pigs (n = 4) survived 28-hour anaesthesia without incident. Of nine pigs that received acetaminophen, four survived 20 hours and two survived 28 hours. Injured animals developed hypotension (mean arterial pressure; 40.8 +/- 5.9 vs 59 +/- 2.0 mmHg), increased cardiac output (7.26 +/- 1.86 vs 3.30 +/- 0.40 l/min) and decreased systemic vascular resistance (8.48 +/- 2.75 vs 16.2 +/- 1.76 mPa/s/m3). Dyspnoea developed as liver injury progressed and the increased pulmonary vascular resistance (636 +/- 95 vs 301 +/- 26.9 mPa/s/m3) observed may reflect the development of respiratory distress syndrome.
Liver damage was confirmed by deterioration in pH (7.23 +/- 0.05 vs 7.45 +/- 0.02) and prothrombin time (36 +/- 2 vs 8.9 +/- 0.3 seconds) compared with controls. Factor V and VII levels were reduced to 9.3 and 15.5% of starting values in injured animals. A marked increase in serum AST (471.5 +/- 210 vs 42 +/- 8.14) coincided with a marked reduction in serum albumin (11.5 +/- 1.71 vs 25 +/- 1 g/dL) in injured animals. Animals displayed evidence of renal impairment; mean creatinine levels 280.2 +/- 36.5 vs 131.6 +/- 9.33 &#956;mol/l. Liver histology revealed evidence of severe centrilobular necrosis with coagulative necrosis. Marked renal tubular necrosis was also seen. Methaemoglobin levels did not rise &gt;5%. Intracranial hypertension was not seen (ICP monitoring), but there was biochemical evidence of encephalopathy by the reduction of Fischer's ratio from 5.6 +/- 1.1 to 0.45 +/- 0.06.

Conclusion
We have developed a reproducible large animal model of acetaminophen-induced liver failure, which allows in-depth investigation of the pathophysiological basis of this condition. Furthermore, this represents an important large animal model for testing artificial liver support systems.

Characterization of Quantitative Loci for Morphological and Anatomical Root Traits on the Short Arm of Chromosome 1 of Rye in Bread Wheat
Bread wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) is the second most cultivated cereal crop after rice. Many present day bread wheats carry a centric rye-wheat translocation 1RS.1BL in place of chromosome 1B. The increased grain yield of translocation lines is positively associated with root biomass. To map loci controlling root characteristics, homoeologous recombinants of 1RS with 1BS were used to generate an integrated genetic map comprised of 20 phenotypic and molecular markers, with an average spacing of 2.5 cM. To identify the chromosomal region associated with rooting ability, root phenotypic data were subjected to Quade analysis to compare genotypes. The distal 15% of the rye 1RS arm may carry QTL for greater rooting ability in bread wheat.To identify QTL for individual root traits, a phenotyping experiment was conducted involving recombinants from each marker interval of the 1RS-1BS genetic map. An empirical Bayes method was applied to estimate additive and epistatic effects for all possible marker pairs simultaneously in a single model. This method has an advantage for QTL analysis in minimizing the error variance and detecting interaction effects between loci with no main effect. Four common regions were identified to involve a total of 15 QTL effects, six additive and nine epistatic, for different root traits in 1RS wheat. Three of four regions were localized in the distal 15% of the 1RS arm. The effect of different dosages (0 to 4) of the 1RS translocation on root morphology and anatomy in bread wheat was determined. The F1 hybrid with single dose of 1RS and 1AS arms showed heterosis for root and shoot biomass. Root biomass was positively associated with increase in dosage of 1RS. This study also provided evidence of the presence of gene(s) influencing root anatomical traits. The central metaxylem vessel diameter was negatively associated with increasing 1RS dosage. Wheat genotypes with higher number of 1RS translocation arms may have inherent morphological and anatomical advantage over normal bread wheat to survive under stress conditions.

Cultura cittadina e lessico di origine francese e provenzale a Napoli in epoca angioina (1266-1442)
Following the methodological perspective of Bruno Migliorini, this paper intends to show the interplay between cultural history ("storia esterna") and linguistic history ("storia interna") during the Neapolitan Angevin period (1266-1442).  The paper focus on some words borrowed from French and Provençal that appeared in the most important literary texts of the Angevin period: the Neapolitan Letter of Giovanni Boccaccio and the Libro de la destuctione de Troya. These words demonstrate how deep the linguistic influence of the Angevins was on local language. Through analysis of the type of diffusion of French words, it is evident that these words spread in the local language via everyday spoken comunication. In fact these loan words reflect the phonetic adaptation to Neapolitan and a significant variety of forms. The great proliferation of some French suffixes, such us the suffix -anza, indicates that French loan words were not only read and written but also used in everyday conversation. Therefore, using French words, Boccaccio intended to describe a lexical cliché of the Neapolitan manner of speaking.

As one of more than 400 ushers to work Rice football games in the 50’s, Straub immediately took to the Rice philosophy and manner. In 46 years of working as an usher at Rice football, he missed a total of three games. In addition, he has worked Rice men’s basketball and baseball games and designed Rice football program covers for 14 seasons. Born in Camden, New Jersey in 1918, Straub began working for Sun Oil in 1938 while attending night school at Temple University. When his country called him to service in 1941, Straub entered the Air Force. In 1945, Straub married Anne Lehde on New Year’s Day and, later that year, left the armed forces as a captain. He graduated from Temple in 1949 and moved to Houston with his two kids and wife, who was expecting her third child, in October of 1950. From that time on, Straub became a fixture and tireless supporter of the Rice athletic department. In addition to working for Tenneco, he used his talents and time to better Rice athletics. Over the past 46 years, he has produced drawings for T-shirts, signs, banners and plaques and has completed Rice’s all-America certificates with artistic hand. His love for the school also filtered down to his children, who also worked at Rice football games. And, in 1967, his son Steve entered Rice as a freshman and athlete on the Rice track team. In 1973, Steve was hired as assistant track coach under current athletic director Bobby May and also served as associate stadium manager. Steve was promoted to head track coach in 1980 and held that position until 1994. Through the good times and bad, Charles Straub felt himself lucky to have the Rice athletic department as an extended family, but it was indeed Rice University which was the most fortunate to have Charles Straub as one of its sons. Therefore, it is the pleasure of the Rice athletic department to bestow upon Mr. Charles Straub the title of Honorary “R” Person.

Ecosystem-scale Selenium Model for the San Francisco Bay-Delta Regional Ecosystem Restoration Implementation Plan
Environmental restoration, regulatory protections, and competing interests for water are changing the balance of selenium (Se) discharges to the San Francisco Bay–Delta Estuary (Bay–Delta). The model for Se described here as part of the Delta Regional Ecosystem Restoration Implementation Plan (DRERIP) draws both from the current state of knowledge of the Bay–Delta and of environmental Se science. It is an ecosystem-scale methodology that is a conceptual and quantitative tool to (1) evaluate implications of Se contamination; (2) better understand protection for fish and aquatic-dependent wildlife; and (3) help evaluate future restoration actions. The model builds from five basic principles that determine ecological risks from Se in aquatic environments: (1) dissolved Se transformation to particulate material Se, which is partly driven by the chemical species of dissolved Se, sets dynamics at the base of the food web; (2) diet drives bioavailability of Se to animals; (3) bioaccumulation differs widely among invertebrates, but not necessarily among fish; (4) ecological risks differ among food webs and predator species; and (5) risk for each predator is driven by a combination of exposures via their specific food web and the species’ inherent sensitivity to Se toxicity. Spatially and temporally matched data sets across media (i.e., water, suspended particulate material, prey, and predator) are needed for initiating modeling and for providing ecologically consistent predictions. The methodology, applied site-specifically to the Bay–Delta, includes use of (1) salinity-specific partitioning factors based on empirical estuary data to quantify the effects of dissolved speciation and phase transformation; (2) species-specific dietary biodynamics to quantify foodweb bioaccumulation; and (3) habitat use and life-cycle data for Bay–Delta predator species to illustrate exposure. Model outcomes show that the north Bay–Delta functions as an efficient biomagnifier of Se in benthic food webs, with the greatest risks to predaceous benthivores occurring under low flow conditions. Improving the characterization of ecological risks from Se in the Bay–Delta will require modernization of the Se database and continuing integration of biogeochemical, ecological, and hydrological dynamics into the model.

The ecology of mosquitoes in an irrigated vegetable farm in Kumasi, Ghana: abundance, productivity and survivorship
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Irrigated vegetable farms within the city of Kumasi, Ghana, create hotspots for the breeding of malaria vectors, which could lead to high transmission of malaria. This study investigated the abundance and productivity of mosquitoes in an irrigated vegetable farm in Kumasi, Ghana.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					Adult mosquito productivity was estimated five days in a week in different irrigated scheme types (dug-out wells, furrows and footprints) for 12 weeks using emergence traps. Larval sampling was done five days a week to estimate the abundance of larvae from the different irrigated schemes types.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					Mosquito breeding in the irrigated vegetable field was confined to dug-out wells, furrows and human footprints. Mosquito productivity (m2/week) was highest in the dugout wells followed by the human footprints and the least was in the furrows (11.23, 5.07 and 4.34 An. gambiae/m2/week). Larval abundance for the late instars (3rd, 4th and pupae) also followed the same trend, with the dug-out wells having the highest larval abundance followed by the human footprints and then the furrows (13.24, 6.81, 5.87 larvae/week). Mosquito productivity and abundance was negatively correlated with rainfall (R2 = 0.209; P&lt; 0.01).
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					
					This study showed that adult and larval mosquito abundance and larval survival were high in the irrigated fields in the irrigated vegetable farm. This therefore, contributed significantly to adult mosquito populations and hence malaria transmission in the city.

Commuting, Congestion and Pollution: The Employer-Paid Parking Connection
Employer-paid parking is a form of matching grant whereby an employer offers to pay the cost of parking if employees are wiling to pay all the other costs of driving to work. In this paper we estimate how employer-paid parking increases the number of vehicle miles travelled to work, the energy consumed by commuting, and total spending on parking and automobile commuting. We then attribute the ubiquity of employer-paid parking to the anomalous federal and state income exemption of employer-paid parking subsidies, and propose a tax policy that will encourage employers to offer their employees the option to choose a cash travel allowance in lieu of a parking subsidy. Finally, we estimate the benefits of cashing out parking subsides, and argue that cashing out parking subsidies is a fair, efficient, and simple first step to improve transportation pricing.
      One way to illustrate how parking subsidies strongly influence commuters' travel costs is to compare the average employer-paid parking subsidy to a hypothetical congestion toll. For commuters who receive employer-paid parking in downtown Los Angeles,, the average employer-paid parking subsidy is equivalent to 11 cents per mile travelled to and from work. Thus, imposing a congestion toll of 11 cents per vehicle mile travelled would raise the cost of driving to the Los Angeles CBD by only as much as employer-paid parking already lowers it.

[pump, biofuel, production]

Engineering microbial biofuel tolerance and export using efflux pumps
Many compounds being considered as candidates for advanced biofuels are toxic to microorganisms. This introduces an undesirable trade-off when engineering metabolic pathways for biofuel production because the engineered microbes must balance production against survival. Cellular export systems, such as efflux pumps, provide a direct mechanism for reducing biofuel toxicity. To identify novel biofuel pumps, we used bioinformatics to generate a list of all efflux pumps from sequenced bacterial genomes and prioritized a subset of targets for cloning. The resulting library of 43 pumps was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, where we tested it against seven representative biofuels. By using a competitive growth assay, we efficiently distinguished pumps that improved survival. For two of the fuels (n-butanol and isopentanol), none of the pumps improved tolerance. For all other fuels, we identified pumps that restored growth in the presence of biofuel. We then tested a beneficial pump directly in a production strain and demonstrated that it improved biofuel yields.

Travel Distance and Market Size in Food Retailing
This paper deals with the process of change in urban systems, specifically the changes in the relationships between urban transportation and food retail distribution activities. The dynamic properties of food retailing and transportation systems are identified by tracing location patterns of food stores in Seattle, Washington. Increases in travel demand due to food shopping trips are estimated based on changes in spatial arrangement of food retail activities over the past 50 years. The study suggests that improved transportation services permitted spatial competition of food stores by increasing store size and scope, which in turn influenced the changes in travel patterns for food shopping. Larger stores mean more traffic on principal arterials since higher level stores require higher level services. As stores became larger and larger, store locations grew increasingly farther apart, requiring consumers to travel longer distances for food shopping. As competition heightened, the stores were more uniformly distributed.

Review of "The Table Comes First: family, France, and the Meaning of Food" by Adam Gopnik
AbstractScholars of flavour and food preferences have shown us that a surprisingly difficult question to answer is, &quot;why do you eat what you eat?&quot; In &quot;The Table Comes First: Family, France, and the Meaning of Food,&quot; Adam Gopnik attempts to address this and a similarly vexing question, &quot;why do we care so much about our food?&quot; by tracing the roots of what happens at the dinner table. Written with both everyday eaters and scholars of food in mind, Gopnik interweaves ideas about the development and meanings of taste with the historical and social circumstances around which we make choices about food and evaluate flavors.

Environmental justice implications of arsenic contamination in California¿s San Joaquin Valley: a cross-sectional, cluster-design examining exposure and compliance in community drinking water systems
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Few studies of environmental justice examine inequities in drinking water contamination. Those studies that have done so usually analyze either disparities in exposure/harm or inequitable implementation of environmental policies. The US EPA&#8217;s 2001 Revised Arsenic Rule, which tightened the drinking water standard for arsenic from 50 &#956;g/L to 10 &#956;g/L, offers an opportunity to analyze both aspects of environmental justice.
				
				
					
						Methods
					We hypothesized that Community Water Systems (CWSs) serving a higher proportion of minority residents or residents of lower socioeconomic status (SES) have higher drinking water arsenic levels and higher odds of non-compliance with the revised standard. Using water quality sampling data for arsenic and maximum contaminant level (MCL) violation data for 464 CWSs actively operating from 2005&#8211;2007 in California&#8217;s San Joaquin Valley we ran bivariate tests and linear regression models.
				
				
					
						Results
					Higher home ownership rate was associated with lower arsenic levels (&#223;-coefficient= &#8722;0.27 &#956;g As/L, 95% (CI), -0.5, -0.05). This relationship was stronger in smaller systems (&#223;-coefficient= &#8722;0.43, CI, -0.84, -0.03). CWSs with higher rates of homeownership had lower odds of receiving an MCL violation (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.16, 0.67); those serving higher percentages of minorities had higher odds (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2, 5.4) of an MCL violation.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					We found that higher arsenic levels and higher odds of receiving an MCL violation were most common in CWSs serving predominantly socio-economically disadvantaged communities. Our findings suggest that communities with greater proportions of low SES residents not only face disproportionate arsenic exposures, but unequal MCL compliance challenges.

Buffers between grazing sheep and leafy crops augment food safety
The presence of livestock in or near fresh-market vegetable fields has raised concerns about the potential for contaminating produce with pathogenic bacteria. To develop buffer zones for grazing near production of leafy greens, we assessed the prevalence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella species in  sheep that were grazed on alfalfa fields during the winter in California’s Imperial Valley. We found E. coli O157:H7 in 1.8% of fecal samples and 0.4% of soil samples, and Salmonella in 0.8% of fecal samples and 0.4% of soil samples. Our results indicate that sheep grazing on alfalfa in the Imperial Valley have a low prevalence of these pathogens in their feces and that these bacteria are rarely found in soil from fields with grazing sheep. The California Leafy Green Products Handler Marketing Agreement guideline of 30 feet between grazing lands or domestic animals and the crop edge is adequate to minimize potential contamination of nearby crops.

Children eat their school lunch too quickly: an exploratory study of the effect on food intake
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Speed of eating, an important aspect of eating behaviour, has recently been related to loss of control of food intake and obesity. Very little time is allocated for lunch at school and thus children may consume food more quickly and food intake may therefore be affected. Study 1 measured the time spent eating lunch in a large group of students eating together for school meals. Study 2 measured the speed of eating and the amount of food eaten in individual school children during normal school lunches and then examined the effect of experimentally increasing or decreasing the speed of eating on total food intake.
				
				
					
						Methods
					The time spent eating lunch was measured with a stop watch in 100 children in secondary school. A more detailed study of eating behaviour was then undertaken in 30 secondary school children (18 girls). The amount of food eaten at lunch was recorded by a hidden scale when the children ate amongst their peers and by a scale connected to a computer when they ate individually. When eating individually, feedback on how quickly to eat was visible on the computer screen. The speed of eating could therefore be increased or decreased experimentally using this visual feedback and the total amount of food eaten measured.
				
				
					
						Results
					In general, the children spent very little time eating their lunch. The 100 children in Study 1 spent on average (SD) just 7 (0.8) minutes eating lunch. The girls in Study 2 consumed their lunch in 5.6 (1.2) minutes and the boys ate theirs in only 6.8 (1.3) minutes. Eating with peers markedly distorted the amount of food eaten for lunch; only two girls and one boy maintained their food intake at the level observed when the children ate individually without external influences (258 (38) g in girls and 289 (73) g in boys). Nine girls ate on average 33% less food and seven girls ate 23% more food whilst the remaining boys ate 26% more food. The average speed of eating during school lunches amongst groups increased to 183 (53)% in the girls and to 166 (47)% in the boys compared to the speed of eating in the unrestricted condition. These apparent changes in food intake during school lunches could be replicated by experimentally increasing the speed of eating when the children were eating individually.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					If insufficient time is allocated for consuming school lunches, compensatory increased speed of eating puts children at risk of losing control over food intake and in many cases over-eating. Public health initiatives to increase the time available for school meals might prove a relatively easy way to reduce excess food intake at school and enable children to eat more healthily.

Essays in behavioral economics : evidence from the field
This dissertation analyzes economic behavior in three different field settings. Chapter 1 examines how students in a university dining program allocated spending of their meal points over time, given a known expiration date, fixed prices, and uniform initial endowment of meal points. I find aggregate retail sales nearly tripled their volume during the two weeks prior to the expiration date. This suggests that a more efficient spending plan may have been available for many students ex-ante. Analysis of individual student spending profiles shows a sizable fraction of students learned how to spend their meal points more smoothly towards the end of the year. The results support existing evidence from lifecycle savings and consumption literatures that individuals often delay paying attention to intertemporal planning problems. Chapter 2 examines the quitting decisions of slot machine gamblers using a casino dataset, asking whether the relationship between quitting decisions and winnings can be most easily reconciled using neoclassical expected utility theory or a Prospect Theory value function. Quitting decisions were highly concentrated near the monetary break-even point, consistent with Prospect Theory. Disproportionate quitting at a reference point persists conditional upon average wager size and number of bets taken, as measured by excess kurtosis. In addition, winnings distributions are positively skewed - implying that people are more likely to quit with winnings above the reference point than below it, and providing support for diminishing sensitivity of the value function's gains and loss segments. Chapter 3 analyzes contract choices of customers of an online layaway contractor. Participants paid a non-refundable price premium for monthly payments to be automatically deducted from their checking accounts towards the purchase of a retail item. Unlike traditional layaway, neither the price nor the availability of the item ordered was guaranteed, suggesting a key motivation for participating was as a savings commitment device. Customers selected greater monthly savings commitments for entertainment and leisure items, compared to more necessary household items. The result is robust to customer-specific effects, price of the item, outstanding layaway obligations, and the expected month of delivery

High-Throughput Molecular Identification of Fish Eggs and Larvae
Ichthyoplankton surveys can reveal the location, timing and intensity of spawning activity for many fish species and are widely used to assess fisheries resources. However, the utility of these surveys is limited by the fact that many eggs and larvae cannot be identified to the species level using morphology alone. This project was motivated by the hypothesis that fish eggs and larvae can be more accurately identified by species specific DNA sequences than by morphology alone.

Upriver and Downriver: A Gradient of Tobacco Intensification Along the Klamath River, California and Oregon
This paper identifies the types of locations where coyote tobacco (Nicotiana attenuataj has been found along the Upper Klamath River and demonstrates how that information illuminates the regional ethnographic record of Native American tobacco use and culture. Locations where coyote tobacco has appeared within the Upper Klamath River vicinity were documented during a fourteen-year period. These data are supplemented by observations from the surrounding region. The aggregate of these observations suggests that coyote tobacco is an ancient, widespread, and potentially common species over a large portion of the landscape within the Cascade Mountain section of the Upper Klamath River watershed. This information, when combined with ethnographic, biogeographic, and experimental data for another tobacco species, Indian tobacco (Nicotiana quadrivalvis), helps to reconstruct a regional history of the horticultural intensification of tobacco by indigenous peoples living along the Klamath River Several lines of evidence indicate the Shasta Indians were intermediate in the transition from less intensive to more intensive methods for procuring tobacco. The evidence also indicates the Eastern and Western Shasta relied on different species of tobacco.

Flavour-Meal Size Conditioning in the Rat (rattus noregicus) Failure to Confirm Some Earlier Findings
A series of experiments was carried out in order to explore further the possibility that hungry rats, both mature and weanling, might learn to associate flavours with different sizes of meals made from the same diet. The general procedure used involved providing rats with either a large meal (e.g. 5 gm). usually consisting of wet mash with an added flavour such as anise, or a small meal (e.g. 1 gm) of the same diet with a second flavour such as vanilla added, on alternate days. Following a number of such discrimination training days, subjects were given a two-jar extinction choice test to assess their relative preferences for the two flavours. It was originally anticipated that rats would come to prefer the flavour associated with the larger meal (i.e., conditioned appetite), because the larger meal provided more calories. However, this result was never obtained. When a significant preference was acquired, this was for the flavour of the small meal instead, (i.e. conditioned satiety). The conditioned effects not only extinguished very rapidly but were also rather elusive at times. It is thought that the observed conditioned satiety effects were probably due to flavour-calorie rather than flavour-flavour associations.

Behavioral Adjustments of Cuckoo Nestlings (Cuculus Canorus) to Foster Parents
The behavior and adjustments of a cuckoo nestling developing in a redstart nest were studied. High acoustic sensitivity was found in the range of non-species-typical components of the sonic feeding complex of the host species. The general tendency of avian hearing development, accelerated formation of low-frequency range, also plays an important role in the biology of the parasite species. A constantly increased level of feeding motivation along with the high acoustic sensitivity are basic for the 100% responsiveness to arrivals of adults with food. Vocalization matching, that is, a coincidence of the frequency band limits and of the intensity of vocalization of a cuckoo chick and redstart brood ensures the equal frequency of feedings. The coincidence of sequence and timing of the periods of nest life of cuckoo and redstart young that were determined with respect to the change of the modality stimulating feeding behavior increases the feeding competition abilities of a cuckoo nestling in the case of forced coexistence with the young of the host species.

As a sophomore in 1984, she and her partner, Susan Rudd, were named all-SWC in doubles after winning the conference title. Yang also finished the season ranked number 33 in the country in singles. Her junior and senior years were more of the same as the fiery righty won two more SWC singles titles, another doubles title (1986), was named SWC co-player of the year in 1985 and player of the year in 1986. A member of the 1985 Junior Federation and Maureen Connolly Cup teams as well, she was named to the SWC all-decade (1982-92) women’s team in 1992. Her career singles record at Rice of 147-36 landed her a spot on the Rice “100 Club.” Yang, just the third athlete to receive the honor, was the first to reach the 100-win mark with her singles play alone. Yang’s abilities did not stop with the hardcourt, however. She was the ITCA scholar-athlete of the year in 1986 and went on to continue her academic career on an ITCA post-graduate scholarship. After graduating from Kellogg in 1992, Yang became an account executive in the area of marketing of tennis footwear and apparel for Reebok International, LTD. The daughter of former major league baseball standout Wilbur Wood, Wendy married her husband Jong Yang in 1990.

Imaging the Angevin Patron Saint: Mary Magdalen in the Pipino Chapel in Naples
In 1279, the Angevin prince, Charles of Salerno, the future Charles II of Naples, discovered the body of Mary Magdalen in Provence. This inextricably linked the Angevins to the Magdalen, whom they adopted as patron saint of their dynasty. A dynasty uniquely aware of the political benefits of personal relationships with saints, the Angevins enthusiastically promoted the Magdalen’s cult. Significantly, it was in Naples, in 1295—the year the Pope authenticated the body discovered by Charles—that the earliest fresco cycle depicting the Magdalen’s life appeared. Over the subsequent half-century, two additional Magdalen cycles were commissioned in Naples. This efflorescence of Magdalen imagery in Angevin territory was directly tied to Angevin promotion of her cult. The Pipino Chapel in San Pietro a Maiella was the final Magdalen cycle painted in late medieval Naples, and presents the most iconographically sophisticated example of the Angevin impact on Neapolitan Magdalen imagery. By closely examining the Pipino Chapel in the context of Angevin promotion of the Magdalen cult, new meanings for the cycle are revealed, illustrating how the chapel’s unknown patron deployed imagery depicting the life of the Angevin patron saint to propagandize for the dynasty and declare allegiance to it.

Keeping the Doctor Away: Experimental Evidence on Investment in Preventative Health Products
Household investment in preventative health products in developing countries is typically low even though the returns to such products are high. In this paper, we experimentally estimate demand curves for health products and test whether (1) information about health risk, (2) cash liquidity, (3) peer effects, and (4) intra-household differences in preferences affect demand. In our main experiment in Kenya involving children’s shoes - critical for preventing hookworm infection - price is by far the most important predictor of purchase. Providing liquidity and targeting women also increased demand. Information had no effect even though we find that genuine learning occurred. We find no peer effects even though people discussed the product purchase decision extensively. We find similar results for price and information in three smaller studies in Guatemala, India, and Uganda in experiments involving soap and multivitamins.

The Perils of Consumption and the Gift Economy as the Solution Daniel Miller’s Consumption and Its Consequences
Miller is an anthropologist who has done much work on people’s connections to consumer objects. This has put him at odds with the view that modern consumerism is driven by false needs. His latest book also acknowledges the impact of consumption on the environment. Miller argues there is no chance of reigning in consumption with campaigns for moral reform. He favours regulation by a so-called neutral science. Whether this is any more politically palatable than moral reform is debatable. Miller does not sufficiently emphasize the role of alienated labour. Within the political framework he favours, alienated labour is inevitable. However, the gift economy could alleviate pressures for consumption by abolishing alienated labour. Miller’s ethnographies appear to show that every consumed product is much wanted. The critique of market failures expains the problems with this conclusion. A complete replacement of the market with the gift economy could be the best option for avoiding problems with consumption.

Mr. Stagnaro's father, a native of Genoa, Italy, arrived in Santa Cruz in 1874 and began commercial fishing. Toward the end of the century he brought his family and relatives to Santa Cruz, and they in turn encouraged others to come; eventually sixty Genovese families comprised the Santa Cruz fishing fleet. His son, Malio, headed the C. Stagnaro Fishing Corporation's various operations (two restaurants, deep-sea fishing trips, and an excursion boat) and was widely regarded as the "mayor" of the wharf. In this volume, Mr. Stagnaro discussed the arrival of the Genovese; the Italian life in Santa Cruz; the operations of the old fishing fleet; early methods for wholesaling and retailing fish; the changes in the tourist industry from 1900 to the present; the effects in Santa Cruz of Prohibition, the Depression, and World War II; the new Santa Cruz Yacht Harbor; and the post-war development of the family corporation.

Spectroscopic Analyses of the Biofuels-Critical Phytochemical Coniferyl Alcohol and Its Enzyme-Catalyzed Oxidation Products
Lignin composition (monolignol types of coniferyl, sinapyl or p-coumaryl alcohol) is causally related to biomass recalcitrance. We describe multiwavelength (220, 228, 240, 250, 260, 290, 295, 300, 310 or 320 nm) absorption spectroscopy of coniferyl alcohol and its laccase- or peroxidase-catalyzed products during real time kinetic, pseudo-kinetic and endpoint analyses, in optical turn on or turn off modes, under acidic or basic conditions. Reactions in microwell plates and 100 mu L volumes demonstrated assay miniaturization and high throughput screening capabilities. Bathochromic and hypsochromic shifts along with hyperchromicity or hypochromicity accompanied enzymatic oxidations by laccase or peroxidase. The limits of detection and quantitation of coniferyl alcohol averaged 2.4 and 7.1 mu M respectively, with linear trend lines over 3 to 4 orders of magnitude. Coniferyl alcohol oxidation was evident within 10 minutes or with 0.01 mu g/mL laccase and 2 minutes or 0.001 mu g/mL peroxidase. Detection limit improved to 1.0 mu M coniferyl alcohol with Km of 978.7 +/- 150.7 mu M when examined at 260 nm following 30 minutes oxidation with 1.0 mu g/mL laccase. Our assays utilized the intrinsic spectroscopic properties of coniferyl alcohol or its oxidation products for enabling detection, without requiring chemical synthesis or modification of the substrate or product(s). These studies facilitate lignin compositional analyses and augment pretreatment strategies for reducing biomass recalcitrance.

[diesel, truck, emission, heavy-duty, weekend]

A Fuel-Based Inventory for Heavy-Duty Diesel Truck Emissions
A fuel-based method for estimating heavy-duty diesel truck emissions is described.  In this method, emission factors are normalized to fuel consumption; vehicle activity is measured by the amount of diesel fuel consumed. For the San Francisco Bay Area during summer 1996, heavy-duty diesel trucks were estimated to emit 100⋅103 kg/day of NOx and 6.4⋅103 kg/day of exhaust PM.  These values were 2.1 and 1.8 times, respectively, the corresponding values predicted by California’s motor vehicle emission inventory model, MVEI 7G.  Significant decreases in diesel truck activity and emissions, 70-80% below typical weekday levels, were observed in the Bay Area on weekends.  Reductions in diesel NOx and black carbon (BC) particle emissions on weekends may contribute to higher ambient ozone concentrations and higher OC/BC ratios observed on weekends. Heavy-duty truck traffic peaks on weekdays during the middle of the day and falls off before the afternoon rush hour.  Therefore, the diurnal pattern of heavy-duty truck travel may contribute to increases in ambient OC/BC ratios observed during late afternoon hours.

Dynamic predictive clothing insulation models based on outdoor air and indoor operative temperatures
Clothing affects people’s perception of the thermal environment. Two dynamic predictive models of clothing insulation were developed based on 6,333 selected observations of the 23,475 available in ASHRAE RP-884 and RP-921 databases. The observations were used to statistically analyze the influence of 20 variables on clothing insulation.
       
      The results show that the median clothing insulation is 0.59 clo (0.50 clo (n=3,384) in summer and 0.69 clo (n=2,949) in winter). The median winter clothing insulation value is significantly smaller than the value suggested in the international standards (1.0 clo). The California data (n= 2,950) shows that occupants dress equally in naturally and mechanically conditioned buildings and all the data has female and male dressing with quite similar clothing insulation levels. Clothing insulation is correlated with outdoor air (r = 0.45) and indoor operative (r=0.3) temperatures, and relative humidity (r=0.26) An index to predict the presence of a dress code is developed.
       
      Two multivariable linear mixed models were developed. In the first one clothing is a function of outdoor air temperature measured at 6 o’clock, and the second one adds the influence of indoor operative temperature. The models were able to predict 19 and 22% of the total variance, respectively. Climate variables explain only a small part of human clothing behavior; nonetheless, the predictive models allow more precise thermal comfort calculation, energy simulation, HVAC sizing and building operation than previous practice of keeping the clothing insulation values equal to 0.5 in the cooling season and 1 in the heating season.

Dancing Africa in Bahia : dance, embodied authenticity and the consumption of "Africa" in Bahia, Brazil
In Brazil, images and ideas of Africa have been historically linked to the northeastern state of Bahia, more specifically with the former colonial capital and port city of Salvador. While the city boasts a dense population of people of African or mixed African and European descent, a powerful way that Bahia's blackness has historically been confirmed and perpetuated has been through the continued reproduction of symbols of Africa, both stigmatized and valorized. An essential and insightful medium through which this Bahian Africa can be seen clearly in Salvador is through the city's dance culture. This master's thesis analyzes the way imagined African symbols have been consumed, appropriated, and authenticated through particular embodied dance forms in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. This imagined Africa, while both feared and adored, has been effectively re-imagined, consumed, and performed many times in Bahia. This consumption of imagined symbols--both traditional and local, as well as exotic and African--has and continues to solidify stereotypes of Africa as a symbolic form loaded with complex and often contradictory notions of authenticity, one that can be seen as a powerful simulacrum with a life of its own, potentially devoid of any true origin

Is Methanol the Transportation Fuel of the Future?
A solution to growing petroleum imports and continuing urban air-pollution problems is the use of clean-burning nonpetroleum fuels in motor vehicles. Methanol is widely viewed as the most attractive candidate for transportation fuel of the future. We examine how methanol gained this preeminent position by analyzing the historical interplay of economic interests, technical judgments, and ideology and then show that the preference for methanol is not the only conclusion to be drawn from the available evidence. An equally good choice may be natural gas.

Physiological Underpinnings of High Voluntary Exercise in Selectively Bred Mice: Effects of Western Diet
Obesity is a growing health problem worldwide, particularly within the United States.  The percent of both overweight and obese Americans (~2/3 combined as of surveys completed in 1999-2004) has continued to increase over the past two decades.  Exercise is a cornerstone for the treatment of obesity, and understanding the regulation of energy balance in response to exercise is essential for the prevention of obesity and the metabolic syndrome.	Using lines of house mice that have been selectively bred for high voluntary wheel running (high runner HR) and their non-selected control lines, I have characterized changes in both ability to exercise and propensity to exercise, both of which, at least in humans, can independently impact mortality rates.  The increased endurance capacity observed in the four replicate high runner lines of mice provides evidence of a genetic correlation between the ability and propensity for aerobic exercise.  However, this genetic advantage does not appear to confer resistance to diet-induced obesity or key components of the metabolic syndrome.  But the elevated running behavior of HR mice does reduce susceptibility to diet induced obesity.  In an 8-wek study, I found that circulating blood lipids are not affected by wheel running in either high runner or control mice, but gain of fat mass is greatly reduced by wheel access, even when animals are eating a Western diet, high in fat and with added sucrose.           I also found an unprecedented genotype-by-environment interaction.  High runner mice showed a remarkable increase in wheel running when given Western diet, whereas wheel running of control mice was unaffected.  Based on results from skeletal muscle enzyme assays, molecular levels of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, the increase in running is likely related more to central nervous system fatigue or motivation rather than the availability of lipid substrates as an energy source. 	In conclusion, my research provides further evidence of important genetic differences between the high runner lines of mice and their non-selected controls, further elucidating how athletic performance evolves.  My results also demonstrate the importance of genotype-by-environmental interactions, which are likely to account for a substantial fraction of the differences among individuals for many complex phenotypes, including energy balance, obesity, and voluntary exercise.  Understanding these interactions will likely prove essential for stopping and reversing the current trends in human obesity and many other complex human diseases.

The Effect of Solar Ovens on Fuel Use, Emissions, and Health: Results from a Randomized Controlled Trial
Emissions from burning biomass fuels cause approximately 2 million premature deaths every year and contribute to deforestation. Due to complex cooking patterns and significant behavior change associated with many clean cookstoves, laboratory results are often far better than those from the field. We ran a phased randomized controlled trial in rural Senegal to test the effects of a solar oven-the Hotpot- on women cook’s carbon monoxide inhalation, fuel use, time spent collecting fuel, and usage. We find low usage rates of the Hotpot- 19% after six months, marginal effects on fuel consumption, and no effects on time spent collecting fuel, carbon monoxide exposure, or time spent next to the cook fire. Despite the mismatch of the Hotpot with local cooking practices and large family sizes, the population is well suited for an improved stove intervention as cooks and their accompanying children are exposed to dangerous levels of emissions from the cookfire- 130% of the WHO daily recommended level of CO emissions. A key result from our program is stove designers- both of solar and other improved biomass cookstoves- should reassess product design to produce stoves that are affordable, durable, consistent with current cooking practices (for example, contains two burners) and are large enough to accommodate multigenerational and/or polygamous households with limited incomes and no electricity. Additional key lessons for future research include the importance of researching best practice in marketing strategies to the rural poor, designing a more complete kitchen solution to include optimal kitchen design, and finding solutions to increase the wider households’ willingness to pay for a product which primarily benefits women and children. This evaluation was a policy success because its results halted the proposed nationwide rollout of the solar oven, thus avoiding mass distribution of a stove which cannot reduce Indoor Air Pollution or generate a sizeable decrease in fuel use for the population.

Suitability of a Constructed Treatment Wetland as Conservation Habitat and the Impact of the Arroyo Chub (<italic>Gila orcutti</italic>) on the Invertebrate Community and  Mosquito Oviposition
The arroyo chub, <italics>Gila orcutti</italics>, is native to the watersheds of southern California and has been proposed as a replacement for the non-native western mosquitofish, <italics>Gambusia affinis</italics>, as a biological control agent for mosquitoes in sensitive watersheds throughout the region.  Because mosquito-eating fish are not strictly larvivorous, they also have the potential to impact non-target organisms in systems where they are introduced. The impact of arroyo chub stocking density on the invertebrate community, and the suitability of a riverine constructed wetland as conservation habitat for the arroyo chub population, in the Santa Ana River were evaluated at the Prado Wetlands in Riverside County, California.  Invertebrate abundance and community structure did not differ significantly among three stocking densities (0, 1.5 and 6 kg/ha) during a five-week study in cage mesocosms. Approximately 16 months after stocking <italics>G. orcutti</italics> into a 0.9-ha wetland, nearly 3,700 fish were collected; however, no arroyo chubs were recovered.  All of the fish collected were invasive species in the Santa Ana River system and piscivory by non-native species most likely caused the extirpation of the arroyo chubs in the wetland.The ovipositional responses of female <italics>Culex tarsalis</italics> to semiochemicals produced by aquatic organisms in three aquatic guilds (predaceous insects, algivorous fish and predatory/larvivorous fish) were examined in laboratory choice assays.  Previous binary choice trials have shown that female mosquitoes avoid laying eggs on water that contains fish exudates and will instead choose to oviposit on water without kairomones released by fish.  <italics>Culex tarsalis</italics> was not deterred from ovipositing in cups containing semiochemicals from invertebrate predators and algivorous fish, but was deterred from ovipositing in cups containing arroyo chub semiochemicals.

GPS precipitable water measurements used in the analysis of California and Nevada climate
Precipitable water (integrated water vapor) can be obtained from zenith travel-time delays of Global Positioning System (GPS) signals, if the atmospheric pressure and temperature at the site are known. There have been large numbers of GPS receivers deployed for geophysics research programs, but unfortunately most of these receivers do not have co-located barometers and thermometers. In this paper archived zenith delays are combined with estimates of GPS site station pressure and temperature from the North American Regional Reanalysis, in order to generate a seven year record of precipitable water at more than 500 sites. The precipitable water values calculated using this method have been found to be in good agreement with GPS precipitable water values from stations with barometers, as well as with radiosonde measurements of precipitable water. Precipitable water has a wide variation across the region, from just a few millimeters in the driest conditions to over 50 mm during strong episodes of the North American Monsoon. The spatial and temporal variations of precipitable water are examined, including the annual and diurnal cycles. Strong annual cycles are seen at almost all sites, and diurnal cycles are also present, increasing away from bodies of water and toward the south, where they reach more than 10% of the daily mean. Precipitable water is found to follow a lognormal distribution at all sites in the region, with some stations showing a small bimodal characteristic due to the influence of the North American Monsoon. An index is proposed that measures the bimodality and hence the "monsooniness" of a site. The elevation dependence of the precipitable water is examined and found to have an exponential decrease which is quite tightly followed in the fall, winter and spring, but more loosely in the summer. It has a greater scale height than has previously been measured elsewhere, ranging from 2.4 km in the winter to 3.1 km in the summer. The landward penetration of water vapor associated with atmospheric river events is examined using several elevation independent parameters and the influence of the atmospheric rivers is seen to be greatest in the northern coastal areas

Constructed Wetlands as a Mitigation Strategy to Reduce  Pesticide Loads in Agricultural Tailwater
Pyrethroid and organophosphate pesticides have been found in numerous waterways throughout the United States.  Monitoring studies within the San Diego Creek watershed in Orange County, California, confirmed that runoff from agricultural fields are a primary contributor to pesticide loads within these waterways.  As a mitigation option for non-point pesticide pollution, constructed wetlands were investigated in this study to reduce pesticide loading in agricultural tailwaters.  Multiple wetlands located along the San Joaquin River in the Stanilaus County were observed over two consecutive irrigation seasons.  The wetlands were found to be very effective at reducing pyrethroid concentrations (52 - 100%) and moderately effective at reducing chlorpyrifos concentrations (52 - 61%) under two flow regimes, with loads reduced by 95 - 100% in the outgoing water.  Vertical transport of pyrethroids was found to be negligible, and less than 10% of chlorpyrifos was found to leach below 16 cm in the wetland floors.  A significant increase in removal efficiencies between seasons within one portion of the wetland was observed, and was attributed to a dramatic increase in vegetation and decreased flow rates.  Pyrethroids overwhelmingly sorbed to suspended solids greater than 0.7 µm (62 - 93%), with resulting apparent partitioning coefficients (Kd a) ranging from 1.9 E104 to 3.1 E 105.  The freely dissolved concentrations of permethrin represented approximately 26 - 39% of its total mass in water samples with a decreasing trend in concentrations toward the outlet, signaling a decrease in the bioavailable fraction in the outgoing flow.  Pesticide concentrations mimicked organic carbon content of the deposited sediment particle fractions.  The highest concentrations were associated with larger particles comprised of aggregates of organic and decomposed plant material, which are less susceptible to sedimentation.  This observation helps explain why the sediment basin was not effective at removing pesticides from the tailwater.  Effective wetland lengths (L1/2) necessary to reduce pesticide concentrations by 50% were estimated to be less than 100 m for cyhalothrin, cypermethrin and permethrin under low flow (0.03 m3s-1), but reaching 267 m under high flow conditions (0.07 m-3 s-1).  The degradation studies indicate that the pesticides have the potential for persisting within the wetland system between irrigation seasons.    While the half-lives of lambda-cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, esfenvalerate, and permethrin were less than 1 yr (r2 > 0.48) under anaerobic conditions, no detectable dissipation occurred for most pesticides in situ during the dry season.  Bifenthrin was found to be relatively stable in all sediments, indicating its potential for prolonged persistence within the wetland systems.  The results from this study indicate that constructed wetlands may act as a sink for most pyrethroids, and the removal is achieved through sedimentation and sediment trapping by vegetation and gravity.  However, accumulation of pesticides over time, and the associated environmental risks of the accumulated pesticide residues, should be further understood if constructed wetlands are to be widely used as a management practice.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms in CETP, SLC46A1, SLC19A1, CD36, BCMO1, APOA5, and ABCA1 are significant predictors of plasma HDL in healthy adults
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					In a marker-trait association study we estimated the statistical significance of 65 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 23 candidate genes on HDL levels of two independent Caucasian populations. Each population consisted of men and women and their HDL levels were adjusted for gender and body weight. We used a linear regression model. Selected genes corresponded to folate metabolism, vitamins B-12, A, and E, and cholesterol pathways or lipid metabolism.
				
				
					
						Methods
					Extracted DNA from both the Sacramento and Beltsville populations was analyzed using an allele discrimination assay with a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry platform. The adjusted phenotype, y, was HDL levels adjusted for gender and body weight only statistical analyses were performed using the genotype association and regression modules from the SNP Variation Suite v7.
				
				
					
						Results
					Statistically significant SNP (where P values were adjusted for false discovery rate) included: CETP (rs7499892 and rs5882); SLC46A1 (rs37514694; rs739439); SLC19A1 (rs3788199); CD36 (rs3211956); BCMO1 (rs6564851), APOA5 (rs662799), and ABCA1 (rs4149267). Many prior association trends of the SNP with HDL were replicated in our cross-validation study. Significantly, the association of SNP in folate transporters (SLC46A1 rs37514694 and rs739439; SLC19A1 rs3788199) with HDL was identified in our study.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Given recent literature on the role of niacin in the biogenesis of HDL, focus on status and metabolism of B-vitamins and metabolites of eccentric cleavage of &#946;-carotene with lipid metabolism is exciting for future study.

Perception of Species-specific Vocalizations by Isolate-reared Buegerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus)
Budgerigars were trained with operant conditioning procedures to discriminate among sets of calls from several species in a Same-Different task. Response latencies from this task were analyzed in several ways including multidimensional scaling (MDS) and cluster analysis. The pattern of response latencies from budgerigars reared in a large group of conspecifics was compared to that of budgerigars reared in acoustic and social isolation. Results show that budgerigars with previous experience with species-specific vocalizations and isolate-reared birds who had never heard such sounds can both discriminate among the categories of species-specific vocal signals. But, results from  MDS and cluster analysis also show that rearing budgerigars in isolation has subtle effects on the perception of these categories of vocal signals.

Integrated analysis of microRNA expression and mRNA transcriptome in lungs of avian influenza virus infected broilers
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Avian influenza virus (AIV) outbreaks are worldwide threats to both poultry and humans. Our previous study suggested microRNAs (miRNAs) play significant roles in the regulation of host response to AIV infection in layer chickens. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis if genetic background play essential role in the miRNA regulation of AIV infection in chickens and if miRNAs that were differentially expressed in layer with AIV infection would be modulated the same way in broiler chickens. Furthermore, by integrating with parallel mRNA expression profiling, potential molecular mechanisms of host response to AIV infection can be further exploited.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					Total RNA isolated from the lungs of non-infected and low pathogenic H5N3 infected broilers at four days post-infection were used for both miRNA deep sequencing and mRNA microarray analyses. A total of 2.6 M and 3.3 M filtered high quality reads were obtained from infected and non-infected chickens by Solexa GA-I Sequencer, respectively. A total of 271 miRNAs in miRBase 16.0 were identified and one potential novel miRNA was discovered. There were 121 miRNAs differentially expressed at the 5% false discovery rate by Fisher&#8217;s exact test. More miRNAs were highly expressed in infected lungs (108) than in non-infected lungs (13), which was opposite to the findings in layer chickens. This result suggested that a different regulatory mechanism of host response to AIV infection mediated by miRNAs might exist in broiler chickens. Analysis using the chicken 44 K Agilent microarray indicated that 508 mRNAs (347 down-regulated) were differentially expressed following AIV infection.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					A comprehensive analysis combining both miRNA and targeted mRNA gene expression suggests that gga-miR-34a, 122&#8211;1, 122&#8211;2, 146a, 155, 206, 1719, 1594, 1599 and 451, and MX1, IL-8, IRF-7, TNFRS19 are strong candidate miRNAs or genes involved in regulating the host response to AIV infection in the lungs of broiler chickens. Further miRNA or gene specific knock-down assay is warranted to elucidate underlying mechanism of AIV infection regulation in the chicken.

The Target Market for Methanol Fuel
A survey of vehicle owners was conducted in New York State and California to explore the potential target market for methanol in the household sector. Data were collected on revealed and reported premium gasoline purchase behavior and willingness to pay for cleaner fuels and more power. We found that drivers are willing to pay slightly more for cleaner fuels than for more power, although we do not interpret this to mean that when confronted at a fuel pump with two choices, one fuel cleaner but more expensive than the other, a motorist would select the more expensive cleaner-burning fuel. We found that income is not an important variable in predicting the purchase of cleaner fuels and that female drivers and Californians are willing to spend more on cleaner fuels than are male drivers and New Yorkers, respectively. Current premium gasoline users are willing to pay more for additional power and cleaner fuels than are regular gasoline users, indicating that premium gasoline users are likely to be initial buyers of methanol fuel and methanol-powered vehicles.

Conservative Nutrition: The Industrial Food Supply and Its Critics, 1915-1985
Nutritional thinking has undergone several drastic shifts in the past century.  Within two decades of the discovery of vitamins in the 1910s, nutrition experts had begun to argue that much of the ill health in the industrial West was caused by the consumption of too many nutritionally impoverished "processed foods"--highly refined cereals, sugars, and fats--and too few vitamin- and mineral-rich "protective foods"--dairy products, eggs, organs, meat, and fresh fruits and vegetables.  But between the 1950s and the 1980s, a growing number of nutrition authorities started branding many of these very same foods as artery-clogging killers.   The key to avoiding atherosclerosis and other "diseases of civilization," these experts told the public, was to restrict animal fat consumption and eat more carbohydrates.  Yet recently, the low-fat, high-carbohydrate message has come under increasing scientific scrutiny.  Nutritional thinking, it appears, is poised for another about-face.Some scholars have come to the conclusion that authoritative dietary advice keeps changing because nutrition science is inherently too uncertain to permit theories about the nature of the ideal diet to be definitively proved or disproved.  Others have gone even further and claimed that the nutrient-centered approach to food that has defined the field since its origins over a century ago is at fault.  This dissertation challenges these interpretations.  It argues that scientific knowledge of the relationship between food and health, in fact, increased in depth and coherence between the 1910s and 1980s, when official dietary advice was going though its seemingly greatest period of flux.  During that time, researchers working in a wide range of fields accumulated a vast amount of scientific evidence against the consumption of the highly processed "industrial foods" and in favor of what nutritionists used to call the "protective foods."  But this body of evidence failed to cohere into unified perspective, and as a result there were constant shifts in what health authorities considered the ideal diet.

The evolving profile of alternative tobacco use in California
Tobacco control programs, smoking bans, and taxes have been utilized to reduce cigarette smoking in the United States. Found in all tobacco products, nicotine is highly addictive, and many anti-smoking laws can be subverted with other tobacco products. Additionally, many researchers are promoting the use of potentially reduced- exposure products (PREPs) for harm reduction to cigarette smokers. The purpose of this dissertation was to study the use of alternative tobacco products in California, including smokeless tobacco (both traditional products and PREPs), cigars, and hookah. Some data are drawn from the California Tobacco Surveys (CTS), which are large, population-based random-digit-dial telephone surveys that collect representative statewide data on tobacco-related behaviors. Analysis of the 1990-2008 CTS was conducted to estimate prevalence and trends of cigar, smokeless tobacco, and hookah use in California adults as well as PREP use among current adult smokers. The remaining data were from a cross-sectional survey of high school students conducted to estimate hookah-use patterns and risk factors among this highly susceptible population. From the 2008 CTS, male cigar current-use was 7.8% and female ever-use was 7.0%, the highest recorded levels since the inception of the CTS in 1990. Ever-use of hookah was 11.2% among males and 2.8% among females. Hookah use has increased by more than 40% since 2005 and is highly prevalent among young adults. Among California smokers, hypothetical cigarette replacement receptiveness was 10.3% for health reasons and 15.2% for convenience reasons. Use of actual PREPs was also low (Snus, 2.2%; Ariva, 1.5%; other PREPs, 4.1%). From the high school survey, hookah use (ever-use, 26.1%; previous month, 10.9%; current, 10.3%) was higher than adult use from the CTS. Subjects believed hookah is more socially acceptable and safer than other tobacco products. Users were more likely than non-users to report a hookah lounge in their community. Current users were more likely than former users to have recently smoked a cigarette, report a hookah lounge in their community, and believe hookah is more socially acceptable than cigarettes. The use of alternative tobacco products is not decreasing in California. Specifically, the use of hookah is concerning, as both adolescents and young adults are smoking hookah at a higher rate than other products. Hookah-specific interventions and the legality of h̀ookah lounges' represent opportunities for immediate action

Optimal Intercity Transportation Services with Heterogeneous Demand and Variable Fuel Price
In this thesis we examine how fuel price variation affects the optimal mix of services in intercity transportation. Towards this end, we make two main contributions. The first is the development of an analytic total logistics cost model of intercity transportation, which is sensitive to fuel price and incorporates multiple classes of vehicles serving passengers with differentiated values of time. The second is an empirical investigation of the cost relationship between fuel price and operating cost for intercity transportation vehicles. The analytic total logistics cost models are combined with the empirical models to gain insights into the impact of fuel price on optimal service mixes in representative corridors.
      We consider a scheduled intercity transportation corridor on which different classes of intercity transportation vehicles serve passengers with differentiated values of time. In determining optimal service mix, we consider a central planner choosing the vehicles and service frequencies that provide the minimum total logistics cost for an intercity transportation corridor. The total logistics cost is the sum of the two main intercity transportation cost components: vehicle operator cost and passenger cost. In considering operating and passenger costs together, we balance cost efficiency and level of service of alternative vehicles with different cost structures and service attributes.
      In developing the total logistics cost model, we seek both analytic insights and numerical examples. To keep the model analytically tractable while at the same time incorporating multiple objectives, including fuel cost, operating cost, schedule delay, and line-haul time, we incorporate the continuum approximation method from logistics. In employing the continuum approximation, discrete variables are considered continuous, leading to analytic functions from which we can evaluate qualitatively the relationships among fuel price, service level, and comparative vehicle cost. An investigation of the analytic model suggests that, while a fuel price increase would increase costs for any corridor, the rate of cost increase for a corridor served by a mix of vehicle technologies diminishes more rapidly with fuel price. We also find that an increase in fuel price causes vehicles to become more differentiated with respect to the value of time of the passengers they serve. In other words, under high fuel prices the total logistics cost can be minimized by effectively segregating passengers on different types of vehicles according to their values of time.
      We complement the analytic findings with an empirical investigation of the cost relationship between fuel price and operating cost for different classes of intercity transportation vehicles. We perform this analysis for a subset of intercity transportation vehicles for which data is readily available: jet and turboprop aircraft. In developing a translog operating cost model for jet aircraft, we estimate a flexible functional form that provides a detailed representation of the empirical relationship between fuel cost and operating cost, allowing for substitution, scale, aircraft age, and other effects – including interactions – to be captured. The function reveals that as fuel price increases, airlines will take steps to use fuel more efficiently by leveraging other inputs; however, the potential for this supplier input substitution for fuel is rather modest. This finding reinforces the formulation of the analytic total logistics cost model, in which the only actions available to a central planner to reduce costs are changing technologies and service frequencies. It also proves that empirical models with simpler functional forms are able to accurately predict operating costs, despite the lack of variable interactions. Using linear empirical operating cost models, we estimate operating cost and total logistics costs for intercity transportation corridors served by single vehicle fleets of three different aircraft classes. We find that a specific turboprop aircraft model, with a relatively low fuel consumption rate, provides intercity transportation service with the minimum operating cost compared with a jet with smaller seating capacity over all fuel prices considered and medium-capacity jets for some fuel prices. However, this is no longer the case when total logistics cost is considered, due to the lower quality of passenger service turboprops provide. At a given intercity transportation corridor distance, the fuel price for which the total logistics cost per passenger is equal across turboprops and low-capacity jets is in the fuel price range experienced from 2004 and expected through 2020. For this fuel price range, the total logistics cost per passenger for the medium-capacity jet is generally lower than the turboprop and always lower the lowcapacity jet. This suggests that a mix of services between intercity transportation vehicles could minimize cost for this range of fuel price.
      To investigate the possibility of mixing services to reduce costs further, we combine the analytic total logistics cost model with the empirical models. In addition to a jet and turboprop aircraft model, we build a high speed rail cost model and consider high speed rail as an additional intercity transportation technology. We find the minimum cost vehicle combination to be sensitive to fuel price in a small transition zone within which the cost ordering of vehicle combinations changes significantly, whereas outside this zone the orderings are stable. As the transition area is in the range of fuel prices forecasted between the years 2010-2035, the results indicate fuel price changes between 2010 and 2035 may dramatically alter the most cost-effective ways to provide intercity passenger transport. We find that high speed rail is a part of a mixed vehicle service that can reduce total logistics cost, suggesting that an integrated air and rail strategy could be an effective tool to manage costs and fuel consumption for an intercity transportation system.

Eradication of bovine tuberculosis at a herd-level in Madrid, Spain: study of within-herd transmission dynamics over a 12 year period
AbstractBackgroundEradication of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) through the application of test-and-cull programs is a declared goal of developed countries in which the disease is still endemic. Here, longitudinal data from more than 1,700 cattle herds tested during a 12&#8201;year-period in the eradication program in the region of Madrid, Spain, were analyzed to quantify the within-herd transmission coefficient (&#946;) depending on the herd-type (beef/dairy/bullfighting). In addition, the probability to recover the officially bTB free (OTF) status in infected herds depending on the type of herd and the diagnostic strategy implemented was assessed using Cox proportional hazard models.ResultsOverall, dairy herds showed higher &#946; (median 4.7) than beef or bullfighting herds (2.3 and 2.2 respectively). Introduction of interferon-gamma (IFN-&#947;) as an ancillary test produced an apparent increase in the &#946; coefficient regardless of production type, likely due to an increase in diagnostic sensitivity. Time to recover OTF status was also significantly lower in dairy herds, and length of bTB episodes was significantly reduced when the IFN-&#947; was implemented to manage the outbreak.ConclusionsOur results suggest that bTB spreads more rapidly in dairy herds compared to other herd types, a likely cause being management and demographic-related factors. However, outbreaks in dairy herds can be controlled more rapidly than in typically extensive herd types. Finally, IFN-&#947; proved its usefulness to rapidly eradicate bTB at a herd-level.

Acquistion of Pine Cone Stripping Behaviour in Black Rats (Rattus rattus)
Black rats (Rattus rattus) have begun occupying a new habitat in recent years —the Jerusalem pine (Pinus halepensis) forests in Israel. In this, otherwise almost sterile habitat, the sole source of nourishment for the rats is the pine seems that can only be extracted from the cones through a complex feeding technique. Adult black rats unfamiliar with the technique (termed "naive") were unable to attain it either through trial and error or through observational learning when housed with experienced rats (termed "strippers"). In contrast, black rat pups raised by stripper mothers did learn the pine cone opening behaviour. In addition to the presence of a stripper model, however, the clues of the pine seeds themselves, as well as partially open cones, may also play a role in the acquisition of the technique. The state of the cone itself, when encountered by the rat pups, may be an important factor. Three groups of experimental animals were used: 25 pups born to naive mothers and reared on rat chow without exposure to either stripping mothers or partially opened cones; 25 pups born to naive mothers and exposed to pine cones in various stages of opening; 55 pups born to stripper mothers and exposed both to pine cones and to the presence of their mothers actively involved in stripping the cones and feeding on the seeds. We found that pine cone stripping behaviour is learned through two stages of a local enhancement effect: First, the pups are directed to the pine cones as a food resource, and then to the cone's proximal end as a starting point. The development of the stripping technique is acquired individually, with accumulating experience.

Luke P. Cikuth was born in Yugoslavia in 1873 and came to the United States in 1890. After spending several years at various odd jobs, he started an apple packing and shipping business which soon became one of Watsonville's largest packing companies. Cikuth describes his business operations and the apple industry as a whole, covering not only the packing and shipping of apples, but also the problems and techniques involved in growing apples, and the role of the various auxiliary apple industries such as the cider works, vinegar works, apple dryers, and cold storage facilities. He also discusses other agricultural crops that are, or have been, important in the Pajaro Valley and the ethnic groups that have been associated with some of these crops. In the concluding chapter of the manuscript Mr. Cikuth describes the town of Watsonville as it appeared to him in the 1890s.

THE EFFECT OF LITOPENAEUS STYLIROSTRIS AQUACULTURE ON MACROALGAE GROWTH IN OPUNOHU BAY, MOOREA, FRENCH POLYNESIA
Aquaculture has many effects on the surrounding landscape. In Mo’orea, the only aquaculture operation is a shrimp farm in Opunohu Bay. To test the effect of shrimp farm runoff into the bay, a macroalgae field survey was conducted at different distances from the Opunohu River, where the effluent outlets. Algae cover was used to indicate nutrient concentration. I found that there is no significant relationship between distance from the shrimp farm outlet and algae cover. The red algae Acanthophora spicifera is a cultivated human food source and also a highly invasive species in Hawaii. It is found in Opunohu Bay. To test the effect of shrimp farm runoff on the growth rate of A. spicifera, I grew the algae in a laboratory setting in shrimp farm water and in ocean water. I found there to be no significant difference between the growth rates in the two water mediums. Additionally, I found that algae cover increases as distance from shore increases, and that algae prefers rock substrate over sand substrate.

Social determinants of iron supplementation among women of reproductive age:  A systematic review of qualitative data
Iron supplementation for women of reproductive age is a main intervention as part of an interdisciplinary strategy recommended for the control and prevention of iron deficiency and the treatment of mild-to-moderate iron deficiency anemia. This systematic review reports the findings from a meta-synthesis of qualitative data concerning the experiences and perceptions of iron supplementation among women of reproductive age and health service providers worldwide. Qualitative systematic review methods were used to conduct a search of published literature, define inclusion and exclusion criteria, appraise quality of studies, and extract data on the use of iron supplementation among women of reproductive age. Coding, thematic analysis, reciprocal translation, and line of argument synthesis were used to synthesize data. Twelve studies spanning seventeen countries met inclusion criteria and were included in analysis. Seven domains emerged from the review: cultural norms and societal values including explanatory models and medical pluralism; political and socio-economic circumstances; education and communication; social organization and social relationships; health care access and supplement supply; food and nutrition availability; and adherence. In addition, sixteen sub-domains are highlighted. Connecting review findings to a conceptual framework of social determinants of health highlights salient issues that policy makers must consider when adapting global iron supplementation recommendations to the local context.

Artificial Cellulosomes and Arsenic Cleanup: From Single Cell Programming to Synthetic Yeast Consortium
As our society marches toward a more technologically-inclined and industrialized future, energy and environmental sustainability are two of the most challenging problems we face today. With the aid of recent advances in recombinant molecular technology, metabolic engineering has been employed on a variety of host organisms to improve biosorption and biocatalytic capabilities. This has shown immense promise and has become an attractive tool for bioremediation and biofuel production. In regards to these challenges, this dissertation focuses on the use of metabolic engineering for biofuel production and arsenic remediation.     The first objective of this dissertation was to create an efficient and inexpensive whole-cell biocatalyst in an effort to produce economically compatible and sustainable biofuels, such as cellulosic ethanol. The approach used was via surface display of versatile cellulolytic enzyme complexes, namely cellulosomes, on the historical ethanol producer Saccharomyces cerevisiae for simultaneous and synergistic saccharification and fermentation of cellulose to ethanol. The feasibility of assembling cellulosome structures on yeast cell surfaces was first demonstrated by incubating the miniscaffoldin displayed yeasts with the Escherichia coli cell lysates containing three cellulolytic enzymes that were necessary for hydrolyzing cellulose into glucose. The functionally-assembled minicelluosomes retained the synergism for cellulose hydrolysis, resulting in a higher ethanol production level when compared to that obtained from a free cellulase system.     To create a microorganism suitable for a more cost-effective process, called consolidated bioprocessing (CBP), a synthetic consortium capable of displaying mini-cellulosomes on the cell surface via intercellular complementation was subsequently created. In this case, the minicellulosomes were assembled in vivo on yeast surfaces for direct ethanol production and cell growth from cellulose. To tackle the relatively modest ethanol production of the yeast consortium, a designer cellulosme based on the unique feature of the anchoring -adaptor scaffoldin strategy to amplify the number of enzymatic subunits was created. The increased rate in ethanol production indicated that enzyme proximity was crucial to cellulosomal synergy.     To further extend the metabolic engineering strategy toward environmental sustainability, engineered S. cerevisiae strains expressing cysteine desulfhydrase and/or AtPCS were created for enhanced accumulation of arsenic as an efficient biosorbent for environment cleanup.

Lifting the Champlain Sea: A CAS Record of the Transition to Modern Lake Champlain
Between about 9 and 13 ky bp, the isostatically depressed area of the Champlain, Ottawa and St Lawrence valleys were engulfed by the Atlantic Ocean. The resulting Champlain Sea had two distinct sources of water: fresh water sourced from large proglacial lakes fed by the collapsing Laurentide Ice Sheet and North Atlantic marine waters sourced via the contemporaneous eustatic rise. This study focuses on the most recent transition from the Champlain Sea (CS) to modern Lake Champlain when the fluxes between the two water sources were in a state of transition. Carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS) offers proxy evidence for the &#948;34S of ancient waters, a key piece in our interpretation of both flux dynamics and primary redox conditions within the basin. Previous research into CAS has shown that sulfate can be structurally substituted into authigenic and biogenic carbonates. Following wide ranging efforts to calibrate and validate this proxy, it has been demonstrated that the isotopic composition commonly reflects the ambient waters at the time of carbonate precipitation. Because of relatively low rates of bacterial sulfate reduction, the &#948;34S of CAS in the restricted CS can be used to approximate salinity relationships over the interval of interest. These data suggest the Champlain Sea was subject to four flood events from Lake Agassiz dropping salinity (measured in Practical Salinity Units) throughout the lifetime of the marine incursion. Splits taken from the CAS solution yield Mg, Fe, & Sr concentrations; unique to each water source, these data reflect the marine to lacustrine change in aqueous metals and identify the source of the proglacial flood source as Lake Agassiz. Due to the low concentrations of both CAS and calcium carbonate in our samples, we are in a unique position to assess the lower limits of the CAS proxys utility in studies of marine to lacustrine transitions. By capturing the transition from the Champlain Sea to Lake Champlain I detail the dynamics of this evolution as both unrelenting isostatic rebounding and diminishing flood sizes repeatedly lowered the salinity (PSU) of the CS. Moreover, low pyrite and iron monosulfide concentrations within the sediments reveal that aqueous sulfate must have been delivered back into the North Atlantic.

REGULATION OF LIPID METABOLISM AND MILK LIPID CONTENT IN NORTHERN ELEPHANT SEALS
Animals that fast depend on mobilizing lipid stores to power metabolism. Northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) incorporate extended fasting into several life history stages: post weaning development, molting, breeding and lactation. The mobilization and subsequent utilization of lipid stores could have consequences for the current and future survival and reproduction. Despite the importance of lipid metabolism to elephant seals little is known about the regulation of lipid mobilization and the physiological drivers of milk lipid content. This thesis focused on three aspects of lipid reserve rationing in adult female elephant seals. Chapter 1 investigated the mobilization of specific fatty acids from blubber and the partitioning of fatty acids between maternal metabolism and milk synthesis in northern elephant seals. In Chapter 2 I examined the hormonal regulation of lipid mobilization and milk lipid content and in Chapter 3 I investigated the activity of lipolytic enzymes and their relationship to milk lipid content. To examine these topics, fatty acid signatures were compared between the blubber and milk in early and late lactation. Additionally, lipid metabolites and milk lipid content were assessed in relationship to circulating levels of growth hormone, cortisol and insulin. Milk lipid content was also assessed relative to the activity of two lipolytic enzymes in theblubber, hormone sensitive lipase and adipose triglyceride lipase. Results indicate that elephant seals mobilize specific fatty acids in a similar fashion to many other mammals and birds. Additionally, the milk is enriched in long chain monounsaturated fatty acids in late lactation. Mass and adiposity were significant (p<0.05) predictors of milk lipid content. Other important predictors of milk lipid content were circulating non-esterified fatty acid and triglyceride levels, cortisol and insulin. Unexpectedly I found that growth hormone was uncoupled from both circulating lipid metabolite concentrations and milk lipid content. Hormone sensitive lipase was found to be negligible in northern elephant seal blubber, another unexpected result. Adipose triglyceride lipase protein content was higher in late lactation relative to early lactation, but activity levels were stable across lactation and unrelated to milk lipid content.        Molting seals regulate lipolysis differently than lactating seals, with insulin mediating an even greater release of lipid stores in lactating females, to facilitate availability for milk production. There was a more positive relationship between triglycerides and milk lipid content than expected, but there was strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that milk lipid content is regulated at the level of mobilization of milk precursors from lipid stores. Contrary to previous hypotheses, hormone sensitive lipase was not the primary lipolytic enzyme and adipose triglyceride lipase assumed a more prominent role in lipid mobilization. Additionally, the specific regulation of these enzymes may differ among age classes and species. Despite their phenomenal lipid mobilization ability, mechanisms of thelipid mobilization of specific fatty acids are conserved among northern elephant seals and other mammals. Conversely, the hormonal and enzymatic regulation of lipid mobilization exhibit differences between elephant seals and other mammals.

Measurements of Diesel Truck Traffic Associated with Goods Movement
Direct video measurements of surface street truck traffic at eleven intersections and line segments in communities adjacent to southern California ports document that volumes of port-related trucks often reach 400-600 per hour for several hours, immediately upwind of ‘sensitive’ land uses such as schools, open-field parks and residences. The diurnal fluctuation of trucks on surface streets varies by intersection, local conditions, and passenger car commute patterns. Our data provide new insights into the geographic distribution and intensity of truck traffic associated with the increase in goods movement, and are essential for reliably modeling pollutant exposures in port-adjacent communities.

Parental feeding practices in Mexican American families: initial test of an expanded measure
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Although obesity rates are high among Latino children, relatively few studies of parental feeding practices have examined Latino families as a separate group. Culturally-based approaches to measurement development can begin to identify parental feeding practices in specific cultural groups. This study used qualitative and quantitative methods to develop and test the Parental Feeding Practices (PFP) Questionnaire for use with Mexican American parents. Items reflected both parent&#8217;s use of control over child eating and child-centered feeding practices.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					In the qualitative phase of the research, 35 Latino parents participated in focus groups. Items for the PFP were developed from focus group discussions, as well as adapted from existing parent feeding practice measures. Cognitive interviews were conducted with 37 adults to evaluate items. In the quantitative phase, mothers and fathers of 174 Mexican American children ages 8&#8211;10 completed the PFP and provided demographic information. Anthropometric measures were obtained on family members.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					Confirmatory factor analyses identified four parental feeding practice dimensions: positive involvement in child eating, pressure to eat, use of food to control behavior, and restriction of amount of food. Factorial invariance modeling suggested equivalent factor meaning and item response scaling across mothers and fathers. Mothers and fathers differed somewhat in their use of feeding practices. All four feeding practices were related to child body mass index (BMI) percentiles, for one or both parents. Mothers reporting more positive involvement had children with lower BMI percentiles. Parents using more pressure to eat had children with lower BMI percentiles, while parents using more restriction had children with higher BMI percentiles. Fathers using food to control behavior had children with lower BMI percentiles.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					Results indicate good initial validity and reliability for the PFP. It can be used to increase understanding of parental feeding practices, children&#8217;s eating, and obesity among Mexican Americans, a population at high risk of obesity.

Cancer and non-cancer health effects from food contaminant exposures for children and adults  in California: a risk assessment
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					In the absence of current cumulative dietary exposure assessments, this analysis was conducted to estimate exposure to multiple dietary contaminants for children, who are more vulnerable to toxic exposure  than adults.
				
				
					
						Methods
					We estimated exposure to multiple food contaminants based on dietary data from preschool-age children (2&#8211;4 years, n=207), school-age children (5&#8211;7 years, n=157), parents of young children (n=446), and older adults (n=149). We compared exposure estimates for eleven toxic compounds (acrylamide, arsenic, lead, mercury, chlorpyrifos, permethrin, endosulfan, dieldrin, chlordane, DDE, and dioxin) based on self-reported food frequency data by age group. To determine if cancer and non-cancer benchmark levels were exceeded, chemical levels in food were derived from publicly available databases including the Total Diet Study.
				
				
					
						Results
					Cancer benchmark levels were exceeded by all children (100%) for arsenic, dieldrin, DDE, and dioxins. Non-cancer benchmarks were exceeded by &gt;95% of preschool-age children for acrylamide and by 10% of preschool-age children for mercury. Preschool-age children had significantly higher estimated intakes of 6 of  11 compounds compared to school-age children (p&lt;0.0001 to p=0.02). Based on self-reported dietary data, the greatest exposure to pesticides from foods included in this analysis were tomatoes, peaches, apples, peppers, grapes, lettuce, broccoli, strawberries, spinach, dairy, pears, green beans, and celery.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Dietary strategies to reduce exposure to toxic compounds for which cancer and non-cancer benchmarks are exceeded by children vary by compound. These strategies include consuming organically produced dairy and selected fruits and vegetables to reduce pesticide intake, consuming less animal foods (meat, dairy,  and fish) to reduce intake of persistent organic pollutants and metals, and consuming lower quantities of chips, cereal, crackers, and other processed carbohydrate foods to reduce acrylamide intake.

Pre-Screen Loss and Fish Facility Efficiency for Delta Smelt at the South Delta's State Water Project, California
Water exports have been implicated in the decline of fish populations in the upper San Francisco Estuary, California. We evaluated the relation between delta smelt salvage at the John E. Skinner Delta Fish Protective Facility (SFF) and underlying entrainment losses at the State Water Project (SWP, south Delta). We used cultured delta smelt in mark–recapture experiments in February and March 2009 (adults) and June 2009 (juveniles) to estimate: (1) the percent of fish recaptured at the SFF of the total released at the entrance of the SFF (fish facility efficiency), (2) the percent of fish recaptured at the SFF of the total released in Clifton Court Forebay (CCF), a reservoir for SWP exports, and (3) the fish losses in CCF and before the SFF (pre-screen loss). Mean fish facility efficiency was lower in successive releases: February (53.2%), March (44.0%) and June (24.0%). The mean percent recapture of fish released at the CCF entrance was also lower over time: February (3.01%); March (0.41%) and June (0.03%). Correspondingly higher mean pre-screen losses occurred over time: February (94.3%); March (99.1%) and June (99.9%). We concluded that: (1) entrainment losses of delta smelt could be higher at times, compared to other species previously studied at the SWP; (2) pre-screen loss was the largest source of mortality for delta smelt; (3) increased release distance from the SFF and residence time in CCF—and decreased exports—resulted in a lower percentage of recaptured fish at the SFF; and (4) salvage of delta smelt at the SWP does not seem to be a consistent index of entrainment.

Odors, Volatiles and Approach-Avoidance Behavior of the Domestic CHick (Gallus Gallus Domesticus)
Ouraim was to determine whether the characteristics of an olfactorycue influenced the experience-dependent approach behavior observed in domestic chicks and to look at the effects of these odors on behavior in the home-cage. Chicks were reared individually with tubes containing an odor suspended in the home-cage. At day 4 post-hatching they were tested in a runway with visually identical test stimuli suspended at either end; one of these contained the familiar odor and the other was unscented. Chicks reared with the odor of nesting-litter approached the familiar stimulus in preference to the unscented stimulus. Chicks reared with a garlic odor did not demonstrate a preference for either stimulus. A specific preference for the odor f nesting-litter was demonstrated by altering the visual, but not olfactory, cues of the stimuli. Thus, exposure to nesting-litter establishes a preference for this odor, but exposure to garlic odor has no such effect. The same chicks were given a  choice test between nesting-litter and garlic on day 9 post-hatching. Only those chicks reared with garlic-scented stimuli demonstrated a preference; they approached the nesting-litter-scented stimulus. The response of chicks to the presentation of olfactory stimuli within the familiar rearing environment was also assessed. When odors were presented, chicks reared with an unscented stimulus demonstrated a decrease in pecking frequency and increased attention to the testing stimulus, indicated by pecks directed at the testing stimulus and circling activity. Thus, young chicks can detect odors (nesting-litter and garlic odor) and form an association with certain odors (nesting-litter and not garlic odor). The odor of nesting-litter may serve to keep the chick in the proximity of the nest during early post-hatching life.

Dairy employees in the San Joaquin Valley are staying longer in their jobs. Our study in 2009 showed that the average length of employment has increased 250% since 1953 and 40% since 1984. However, tenures among non-Hispanic employees were twice as long as among Hispanic employees, suggesting there are opportunities to further increase workforce stability. The reasons why workers leave dairies are mostly the same as they were 30 and 60 years ago.

Uncovering new regulators of Arabidopsis thaliana fruit morphogenesis
The story of the network of genes that controls fruit patterning in Arabidopsis is still unfolding, and here we have seen familiar players take on different parts and we have identified new regulators that may play important roles. Arabidopsis fruit are patterned into three major regions: the valves, the replum, and the valve margin. Previous studies have shown that the FRUITFULL (FUL) and REPLUMLESS (RPL) genes are responsible for patterning the valve and replum, respectively. To identify new regulators, we screened for mutants that showed rescued replum development in the sensitized rpl ful double mutant background. We identified one suppressor (m33) that likely identifies a new fruit patterning gene as well as another suppressor (m413) that corresponds to the well-known floral homeotic gene APETALA2 (AP2). Although previous studies have characterized the role of AP2 during flower development and its regulation by miR172, little is known about its function during fruit morphogenesis. Here we used promoter-GUS fusions to analyze the expression patterns of the five miR172 genes in reproductive and vegetative tissues and found that miR172 may be controlling AP2 activity in these tissues. In addition, we found that FUL may be an upstream regulator of miR172 in the fruit. These studies have allowed us to incorporate the role for miR172 into current models of fruit patterning. Although the final chapter to this story has yet to be written, our studies have added new insights that will undoubtedly contribute to the long-term goal of understanding the complex network of gene interactions that underlies fruit morphogenesis

Sacramento River Steelhead: Hatchery vs. Natural Smolt Outmigration
The Sacramento River steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is a threatened species whose numbers are supplemented by the release of captive-bred juveniles. Each year, the Coleman National Fish Hatchery alone produces 600,000 yearling steelhead smolts and releases them into Battle Creek, a tributary of the upper Sacramento River. Smolts are young, silver trout (or salmon) that are ready to migrate to sea for the first time. The hatchery operations are mitigation for loss of natural steelhead in their historic spawning grounds. Coleman is one of several hatcheries in the Sacramento River basin that cultures steel- head for mitigation purposes.

Prevalence and co-use of marijuana among young adult cigarette smokers: An anonymous online national survey
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					There is elevated prevalence of marijuana use among young adults who use tobacco, but little is known about the extent of co-use generated from surveys conducted online. The purpose of the present study was to examine past-month marijuana use and the co-use of marijuana and tobacco in a convenience sample of young adult smokers with national US coverage.
				
				
					
						Methods
					Young adults age 18 to 25 who had smoked at least one cigarette in the past 30&#8201;days were recruited online between 4/1/09 and 12/31/10 to participate in an online survey on tobacco use. We examined past 30&#8201;day marijuana use, frequency of marijuana use, and proportion of days co-using tobacco and marijuana by demographic characteristics and daily smoking status.
				
				
					
						Results
					Of 3512 eligible and valid survey responses, 1808 (51.5%) smokers completed the survey. More than half (53%, n&#8201;=&#8201;960) of the sample reported past-month marijuana use and reported a median use of 18 out of the past 30&#8201;days (interquartile range IR&#8201;=&#8201;4, 30). Co-use of tobacco and marijuana occurred on nearly half (median&#8201;=&#8201;45.5%; IR&#8201;=&#8201;13.1, 90.3) of the days on which either substance was used and was more frequent among Caucasians, respondents living in the Northeast or in rural areas, in nonstudents versus students, and in daily versus nondaily smokers. Residence in a state with legalized medical marijuana was unrelated to co-use or even the prevalence of marijuana use in this sample. Age and household income also were unrelated to co-use of tobacco and marijuana.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					These results indicate a higher prevalence of marijuana use and co-use of tobacco in young adult smokers than is reported in nationally representative surveys. Cessation treatments for young adult smokers should consider broadening intervention targets to include marijuana.

The Study of Animal Behaviour in India: Origin and Current Status
Recorded observations on animal behaviour in India date back to ancient times. Behaviour of various animals was observed and described in ancient Indian classics. Many species of animals have been described as 'Vahanas,' that is, animals ridden by various Hindu deities. The sculptures and drawings of a number of deities also include these mounts with their characteristic behavioural patterns. However, scientific investigations on animal behaviour is a recently developed branch of biological science in India, initiated in the late 1950's. Systematic ethological research on various species of Indian animals was begun only in early 1970's, after the formation of the Ethological Society of India. At present a variety of topics such as foraging and feeding behaviour, habitat selection, social and reproductive behaviour, chronobiology, chemical communication signals and neurobehaviour are being investigated by Indian ethologists, who are mainly zoologists, and a few psychologists. A wide range of species from lower metazoa to higher vertebrates are observed by ethologists in India. An analysis of the development of ethology in India indicates that the progress of this discipline as a major field of research and teaching in India is satisfactory. Further, if the present trend is maintained, ethology should develop as a major discipline of animal research in India by the year 2000.

Social Influences on the Food Preferences of House Mice (Mus Musculus)
In a series of studies undertaken to determine the conditions under which naive house mice (observers) develop preferences for foods eaten by recently-fed conspecifics (demonstrators), we found that observer mice exhibited enhanced preference for a food following interaction with either a healthy or an ill recently-fed demonstrator that had eaten that food. We also found that house mice developed an enhanced preference for a food after exposure to an anesthetized conspecific demonstrator powdered with that food, but not after exposure to a cotton-batting, conspecific-sized surrogate powdered with the same food. Results of other studies have indicated that, for both rats and mice, the presence in a food of carbon disulfide (a substance found on the breath of rats) increases preference for a carbon-disulfide-contaminated food. taken together, the parallels between Norway rats and house mice in social learning processes suggest homologous rather than analogous systems of communication about distant foods in these two murid rodents.

Short-Run Subsidies and Long-Run Adoption of New Health Products: Evidence from a Field Experiment
Short-run, targeted subsidies for health products are common in poor countries. How do they affect long-run adoption? Standard economic theory predicts that they may increase long-run adoption through experience and social learning effects. Those effects will be muted, however, if subsidized products are unused or misused. Subsidies have also been argued to generate “entitlement effects”: people may refuse to pay for products that were once free. A field experiment was designed to estimate the relative importance of these competing effects. We find that, for a health product with high private returns (an antimalarial bednet), positive experience and social learning effects largely dominate.

Movement patterns, habitat preferences, and fisheries biology of the common thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus) in the Southern California Bight
The common thresher shark Alopias vulpinus) is a pelagic species that constitutes the largest commercial shark fishery in California waters. Despite its commercial value, little is known of thresher shark biology, nor is there adequate data on which to base fishery management decisions. This dissertation entails four studies dealing with the biology and fisheries interactions of common thresher shark in the Southern California Bight (SCB). Chapter 1 examines the movement patterns of adult and subadult thresher sharks using acoustic telemetry. These larger threshers preferentially inhabit waters offshore of the continental shelf, inhabit shallow waters nocturnally, and may make extensive vertical excursions by day that are suggestive of foraging. In Chapter 2, movement patterns of larger threshers are further examined over extended time periods through the use of archival tagging. Archival data show that in addition to exhibiting diel periodicity in movement patterns, threshers undergo distinct modes of daytime depth distribution for extended periods that are interpreted as relating to regional difference in abundance of surface oriented prey and prey in deeper water. Chapter 3 investigates the habitat utilized by juvenile threshers and shows that they preferentially inhabit waters over the SCB continental shelf as a nursery area. Chapter 4 describes the artisanal fishery for threshers and other elasmobranchs along the Pacific coast of Baja California Norte, Mexico. It was found that 44 artisanal fishing camps are located in the region, of which at least 26 target elasmobranchs. In addition, the detailed species, size, and sex composition of elasmobranchs captured at the Laguna Manuela fishing camp is reported. Finally, Chapter 5 provides a synoptic view of the contributions made by this dissertation towards the current status of knowledge regarding thresher shark life history, ecology, and fisheries biology

The export of carbon mediated by mesopelagic fishes in the northeast Pacific Ocean
Mesopelagic fishes are under-studied in relation to their importance in pelagic ecosystems. Traditional sampling methods (trawls and acoustic surveys) are biased, yet synergistic, and it has become clear in recent decades with the increased use of acoustic methods that the biomass of mesopelagic fishes is larger than thought from net sampling. For this research, I investigated the importance of mesopelagic fishes to the biogeochemical flux of carbon in the northeast Pacific Ocean. Calculation of the fluxes mediated by mesopelagic fishes requires an estimate of their abundance, and to this end I developed a new technique using combined trawl and acoustic data. The interpretation of acoustic data requires knowledge regarding the acoustic properties of fishes, and thus I made basic measurements on over 70 species of mesopelagic fishes. My results indicated that two of the major determinants of the acoustic reflectivity of a fish, body density and swimbladder inflation, vary both between and within species. Mesopelagic fishes were less dense than epipelagic fishes, and those that did not have inflated swimbladders as adults had decreased body density with increased length. Acoustic models of captured mesopelagic fishes were used with inverse modeling of multi-frequency acoustic data to estimate the capture efficiency of the Matsuda-Oozeki-Hu trawl (MOHT). Capture efficiency of the MOHT was estimated to be 14% for mesopelagic fishes. Trawl data, corrected for efficiency of capture, were used to estimate mesopelagic fish biomass at 77 stations in the northeast Pacific Ocean. The export of carbon out of the epipelagic ocean mediated by those fishes ("fish export") was estimated using individual-based metabolic modeling and extrapolated over the study area. Fish export was estimated to be 17% of total carbon export, estimated from satellite data, in the study area. Fish export varied spatially in both magnitude and relative importance. Although overall fish export increased with total export, its fraction of the total export decreased. Fish export exceeded 40% of the total carbon export in the oligotrophic North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Because subtropical gyres comprise over half of the surface area of the global ocean, mesopelagic fishes are of global biogeochemical importance

Understanding the Disparities in Cervical Cancer Screening for Economically Disadvantaged Women
Background:  Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 22% of all deaths among women.  Despite the importance of the Pap test in preventing and detecting cervical cancer, screening rates among poor women remain low.  The pathways linking poverty with lower Pap test use remain unclear.  The screening disparity for this low-cost test suggests that poor women may face other transaction costs, opportunity costs and barriers in accessing Pap tests that are not faced by women living above poverty.  Data/Methods: The data set merged the 2005 California Health Interview Survey, 2000 Census, and safety net clinic data.  I examine elements of the patient-provider interaction (racial/ethnic discrimination) and healthcare system (distance to the nearest safety net clinic) as possible mediators between individual-level poverty and Pap tests.  I then examine the role of individual-level poverty in moderating the association between discrimination and Pap test use and safety net distance and Pap test use.  I also examine whether the neighborhood-level poverty moderates the association between individual-level poverty and Pap tests, discrimination and Pap tests, and distance and Pap tests.  The sample included women, 18-64, with a physician visit in the previous 5 years and no history of cervical cancer.  Mediation was tested using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) and a weighted product-of-coefficients test.  Moderation was tested using GEE and including interaction terms.  Results:  Poor women were significantly less likely to report a timely Pap test, had significantly higher odds of reporting discrimination, and were more likely to reside closer to a safety net clinic.  Discrimination did not predict Pap tests and was not a mediator between individual-level poverty and Pap tests.  Safety net distance predicted Pap tests and was a mediator between individual-level poverty and Pap tests.  Neither individual-level poverty nor neighborhood-level poverty modified the proposed relationships with Pap test use.    Conclusion:  Racial/ethnic discrimination did not explain disparities in Pap tests.  Proximity to a safety net clinic was shown to be protective against disparities and may play a role in addressing disparities in screening.  Individual-level poverty and neighborhood-level poverty did not influence the role of proposed mediators in predicting Pap tests.
