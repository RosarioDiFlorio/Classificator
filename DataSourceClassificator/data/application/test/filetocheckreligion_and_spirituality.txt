Ignorance and Moral Responsibility: A Quality of Will Approach
My central aim in the dissertation is to defend an account of the epistemic condition of moral responsibility that distinguishes culpable ignorance from non-culpable ignorance.  The view that I defend is that ignorance is culpable just when an agent flouts or ignores moral reasons that underlie her epistemic norms or obligations.  This view is a quality-of-will theory of moral responsibility that emphasizes the agent’s reasons-responsiveness.  It holds that only relevant epistemic obligations are those that require acts of investigation or reflection.  
	In the dissertation, I examine extant theories of culpable ignorance and suggest that they all fall short in some important respect.  Then, I propose and defend an account in which epistemic norms play a leading role.  I analyze the nature of epistemic norms and their normativity, and I argue that agents who ignore or flout actional investigative norms and then act on subsequent false beliefs are connected to the wrongness of their action in a way that establishes their blameworthiness.  I also argue that epistemic norms that require agents to hold certain beliefs or make certain inferences are not relevant to culpable ignorance.  Finally, I explore the implications of my view for certain interesting cases of moral ignorance.  I discuss ignorance that results from an agent’s social or historical circumstances, ignorance that stems from pure moral deference, and ignorance that is explained by epistemic difficulty of getting certain moral facts right.  
	There are two striking outcomes of my research.  The first is that reflection on the epistemic condition shows that one cannot think deeply about moral responsibility without also engaging issues in epistemology relating to the nature and normativity of belief, and issues in normative ethics relating to what our moral obligations actually are.  The second striking outcome is that bringing these rather disparate topics together, as I attempted to do, reveals that much of our ignorance is actually non-culpable, and that many of our beliefs about the blameworthiness of ignorant agents are unwarranted.

Tolerance as a Moral and Political Virtue
This dissertation defends the virtue of tolerance against two types of critics.  First, it defends tolerance against critics who claim that it is not a virtue at all.  Second, it defends tolerance against critics who claim that we should dispense with "merely" tolerating others in favor of a more welcoming approach to difference.  I agree that in many cases, we should celebrate diversity rather than simply put up with it.  Moreover, we ought not to tolerate certain behaviors, such as murder or racial discrimination.  Nevertheless, in many cases, we ought to view other people's behavior as the kind of thing that we ought to disapprove of, but not act against.  That is, we ought to tolerate others' behavior.In support of this claim, I argue that there is a hidden cost to attempts to leave tolerance behind.  Without tolerance, people cannot engage in social cooperation despite serious moral disagreements.  We may be able to create a society that allows difference.  However, without tolerance, we cannot have a society that permits serious moral disagreement.  Having made this argument, I go on to discuss ways that we can ensure that our moral and political principles leave room for tolerance.  In particular, I discuss ways that we can enable people to respect each other's freedom, while still taking their moral disagreements seriously.

Making the Bible Belt: Preachers, Prohibition, and the Politicization of Southern Religion, 1877-1918
H.L. Mencken coined “the Bible Belt” in the 1920s to capture the peculiar alliance of religion and regional life in the American South. But the reality Mencken described was only the closing chapter of a long historical process. Like the label itself, the Bible Belt was something new, and everything new must be made. This dissertation is the history of its making. 

Over the course of several decades, and in the face of bitter resistance, a complex but shared commitment to expanding religious authority transformed southern evangelicals’ inward-looking restraints into an aggressive, self-assertive, and unapologetic political activism. Late-nineteenth-century religious leaders overcame crippling spiritual anxieties and tamed a freewheeling religious world by capturing denominations, expanding memberships, constructing hierarchies, and purging rivals. Clerics then confronted a popular anticlericalism through the politics of prohibition. To sustain their public efforts, they cultivated a broad movement organized around the assumption that religion should influence public life. Religious leaders fostered a new religious brand of history, discovered new public dimensions for their faith, and redefined religion’s proper role in the world. Clerics churned notions of history, race, gender, and religion into a popular political movement and, with prohibition as their weapon, defeated a powerful anticlerical tradition and injected themselves into the political life of the early-twentieth-century South.

By exploring the controversies surrounding religious support for prohibition in Texas, this dissertation recasts the politicization of southern religion, reveals the limits of nineteenth-century southern religious authority, hints at the historical origins of the religious right, and explores a compelling and transformative moment in American history.

Tourism, Religion and Religiosity: A Holy Mess
<p>Although religion and religiosity are well-known factors for influencing behaviour in different social settings, there is very limited research that explores the links between them and visitation patterns of tourists. In this study tourists' visitation patterns to a heritage site of religious significance (the Wailing Wall, Israel) are explored. Differences are found between tourists based on their religious affiliation and religiosity. The findings also reveal that the tourists' religiosity has different effects on those with different religious affiliations. It is argued that the actual relationships between a tourist's religion and strength of religious belief need to be understood in relation to the site visited, the tourist's perception of it and the meaning he or she attaches to it. The implications for tourism management and the theoretical investigation of heritage tourism are discussed. </p>

[moral, anxiety, judgment, fact, objectivity]

Rethinking the objectivity of ethics
Commonsense says that morality is objective. But skeptics deny that the normativity and fallibility that characterize this objectivity really exist. I disagree. I develop an account of moral facts that vindicates the objectivity of ethics. Moreover, I do this without relying on either the strong foundational claims of realism and constructivism, or the revisionary logic of expressivism. Instead, I build from a moral psychology that is modest and familiar--one that focuses on the distinctive, but well-known, anxiety that is provoked when we make a moral judgment. Drawing on empirical work, I argue that this anxiety is a universal feature of our social-psychological lives, one we've developed to promote social cohesion. Moral anxiety does this by altering our orientation to others: we become more sensitive to the consequences that our actions can have, and so tend to avoid them if we find that they are not justified. I argue further that this picture of the role that moral anxiety serves points to a broadly teleological account of moral facts: moral facts are the upshot of a validation procedure that alleviates moral anxiety in a manner consistent with the function that it serves. I then develop an account of the form of validity that is constitutive of moral facts. I argue that because moral anxiety is provoked by unease about the legitimacy of one's moral judgment, it will be properly alleviated only if that judgment (i) is not based on false non-moral beliefs, and (ii) uses principles that correctly assess the situations of those affected by the conflict in question. I argue that what counts as p̀roperly assessing the situation of the affected parties' is subjectively fixed in the sense that it is the upshot of what one would defend, on reflection and when pressed, given a motivation to resolve moral conflict in a manner that preserves social cohesion. Despite its subjective nature, my proposal captures the objectivity of ethics: fallibility is possible since the judgments we actually make can come apart from those that we would defend; normativity is explained by the sensitizing effects of moral anxiety

Religious Affiliation, Internalized Homophobia, and Mental Health in Lesbians, Gay Men, and Bisexuals
Latino and Black lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) men and women are more religious than their White counterparts. This greater religiosity was true by every measure, including likelihood to attend religious services, engage in prayer, and identify a religious affiliation. Attending religious services in non-affirming settings compared to attending in affirming settings or not attending at all was linked in the study with higher levels of internalized homophobia.

Moral Beauty and Moral Taste From Shaftesbury to Hume
My dissertation is a historical study which attempts to recover the classical synthesis of aesthetics and ethics as expressed in the concepts of moral beauty and moral taste.  I begin by observing how the ancients saw goodness and beauty as one concept such that moral goodness was conceived as an intrinsically attractive ideal.  Next I show how, at the start of the modern era, Thomas Hobbes and John Locke shifted the basis of moral motivation from internal attractiveness to the external constraints of law, thus eliminating moral beauty from their accounts.  I then trace the emergence of the modern moral taste view in the Cambridge Platonists (viz., Benjamin Whichcote, Henry More, and Ralph Cudworth) and the Third Earl of Shaftesbury and argue that Francis Hutcheson's moral sense theory diverged from this tradition in important ways.  Here I draw a distinction within early modern sentimentalist views between moral taste theories (which build motivation into moral judgment) and moral sense theories (which do not).  Finally I show that David Hume followed Shaftesbury's moral taste theory more closely than he followed Hutcheson's moral sense theory. I conclude that Hume's account is superior to Hutcheson's insofar as the analogy with aesthetic taste emphasizes the importance of tradition, community, and intersubjective conversation whereas the analogy with sense perception appeals only to an ahistorical essentialism.  Moreover Hume's account is superior to Shaftesbury's insofar as Hume's version of the moral taste doctrine is based on a naturalized account of moral beauty which does not rely on natural teleology and is therefore more accessible to us today than ancient Greek accounts.

The core mysteries : Pierre Bayle's philosophical fideism
This dissertation develops an original interpretation of the relationship between reason and religious belief in the work of Pierre Bayle, a seventeenth-century skeptic, that I call "philosophical fideism." The underdetermined, and often paradoxical, nature of Bayle's writing makes interpreting him a formidable task; I therefore begin by sketching out the contemporary interpretive landscape of Bayle studies, currently deeply divided over the issue of Bayle's conception of the reason-faith relationship. I subsequently examine other conceptions of the reason-faith relationship among rationalists and skeptics of the seventeenth century, and argue that Bayle's position on this issue is deeply influenced by his Cartesian inheritance. I argue that the central, but neglected, factor in understanding Bayle on the reason-faith question is the influence of seventeenth-century Calvinist rationalism, particularly that of Moïse Amyraut. I show how Amyraut's tripartite distinction of revealed truths provides the framework for a central element of Bayle's philosophical fideism, and argue that a small group of revealed truths that Bayle calls "the Christian mysteries" form the core of Bayle's philosophical fideism. I attribute a conception of reason to Bayle that I call "qualified Academic skepticism," in contrast to the "supersceptical" interpretation of Richard Popkin on the one hand, and the Stratonian interpretation of Gianluca Mori on the other. Finally, I explain the grounds of Bayle's claims about the erring conscience and the justification for religious toleration. Conscience plays a crucial role in Bayle's philosophical fideism, not only epistemologically, but also morally. The erring conscience supports the interpretation of Christian mysteries as Bayle's own religious first principles, greatly increasing the significance of Bayle's doctrine of the erring conscience. If the conscience is the source of one's core beliefs and of their moral force, then reason, though still able to examine critically the claims of conscience, would be impotent to mitigate the moral force of the duties and rights of conscience. One cannot in good conscience, therefore, be intolerant of those who articulate alternative "first principles" since their source is the individual conscience itself. This account thus establishes a ground for religious toleration that is independent of, but compatible with, religious first principles

The Judeo-Christian Bible, the Tanakh, and the Quran in Don Quixote
ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATIONThe Judeochristian Bible, The Tanakh, and the Quran in the QuixotebyNicholas R. AlemánDoctor of Philosophy, Graduate Program in SpanishUniversity of California, Riverside, March 2011Dr. James A. Parr, ChairpersonCervantes, throughout Don Quixote, intimates doubt about the divine origin and infallibility of the Scriptures: the Tanakh, The Judeo-Christian Bible, and the Koran. Various aspects of the religious, philosophical, and socio-political environment of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in Spain may explain Cervantes's skepticism about the Scriptures and the dominant faith of his time. Don Quixote is viewed as a product of its author's contemporary culture, the violence and controversial ideas of his time, and the contradictions found in the Scriptures.Following his predecessors, Erasmus of Rotterdam and the reformist Martin Luther, Cervantes may have read the Scriptures himself and noticed their contradictions. For example, in the last book of the Torah (Deuteronomy 4.2), the narrator says: "You shall not add anything to what I command you or take anything away from it." But then, two parts are added to the Torah: the Nevi'im (the Prophets) and the Kethuvim (the Writings) to form the Tanakh. Christians violated Jehovah's words by adding the New Testament.  Muslims did the same when changing the order of the "original" Hebrew Bible and by changing, radically, the name of Jehovah to Allãh.   The Quixote builds on these anomalies, often making a parody of Scripture. It questions its own authority in much the same way that the Scriptures are seen to do. It does this largely through its subversive narrative voices. One narrator says one thing, another the opposite. The truth claims made for the aljamiado manuscript of Cide Hamete are an example. Don Quixote was written by an Arab historian, but all Arabs are liars (I.9).  The Bible does not depart one iota from the truth (II.1); nor does the fiction we are reading (II.10).  Aspects of the New Testament are parodied in having a Christ-like figure as protagonist and, at the end, the author himself assumes a role reminiscent of Yahweh and Allah.

From Lost Laughter to Latin Philosophy: On the Beginnings of Neapolitan Humanism
The first part of this essay explores some of the reasons why Neapolitan humanism continued to have a difficult standing throughout the twentieth century, and how scholars of the Neapolitan Renaissance sought to overcome these difficulties. The principal argument will be that modern scholars have circumscribed the character of Neapolitan humanism mainly by adopting paradigms developed in the context of Northern Italian, and especially Florentine humanism. In the second part, a different approach is endorsed. As is argued, the intellectual outlook of Neapolitan humanism was molded rather by conflicts among the humanists than by a stance common to all of them. Therefore, the main question is not the Neapolitan “brand” of humanism, but the role of Neapolitan humanists within the humanist movement as a whole. This point is illustrated by sketches of some of the controversies involving the first generation of humanists at court, namely Antonio Beccadelli, known as Panormita, Bartolomeo Facio, and Lorenzo Valla. Their struggles heavily influenced the intellectual outlook and philosophical style of Giovanni Pontano, the key figure of Neapolitan humanism in the second half of the fifteenth century.

A Leaky House: Haiti in the Religious Aftershocks of the 2010 Earthquake
My research explores nation building, religious conflict and Christian democratization in Post-earthquake Haiti. Christians I spoke with blamed Vodou for the destructive quake. In Haiti, Vodouisants now require UN protection to practice their faith. The thick religious tension in Haiti post-earthquake could portend deep political riffs and dangerous religious persecution.  What is more, the quake has effectively shut down government, leaving in its wake essentially an NGO Republic. Moreover, some sectors of the population, particularly the very poor in the black majority, have been converting to evangelical Christianity at very high rates. About the conversions Vodouisants say, "Kay koule twompe soley soley men li pa twompe lapil." A leaky house can fool the sun, but it can't fool the rain. I took this notion of a leaky house from the discussion with a Vodouisant research participant who often compared the massive conversions to an incomplete and quick cover for the inner turmoils of the Haitian subject.  I expanded this phrase to work as analogy for the significant evangelical/NGO infrastructure in Haiti.  Can this leaky house last as the pseudo-governmental body of Haiti? 
Problem: A devastating 7.0 Earthquake rocked Haiti on January 12th, 2010. By January 24th, at least 52 aftershocks measuring 4.5 or greater had been recorded (CBS News 2010).  Cite’ De Soleil has turned into a devastating battleground-- Vodouisants against Christians. Christian evangelicals have a carte blanche to intervene into the lives of devastated Haitians, also into the Haitian government. Struggling with insufficient capacity in the face of overwhelming poverty and environmental disasters, the Haitian government has capsized in what many are calling a religious coup d’état. At least 10,000 religious non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are operating in Haiti. 
Against this background, the actual hypothesis to be tested in this research is that the conversion from Vodou to most sectors of evangelical Christianity and the subsequent violence against Vodou practitioners is, in the case of some of my research participants, actually a modality for expatriation from, or incorporation into, the New Haitian body politic.

Sex and the Church : a study of the Catholic Church and reproductive health in Chile
This work explores the modern day discourse on sexuality in Chile with particular attention given to the influence of the Catholic Church on reproductive health policy. The Catholic Church has historically been involved in popular social reform efforts in the 19th and 20th centuries, and was also heavily involved as the protectorate of human rights during the Pinochet dictatorship. Due to this popular reputation of the Church after the dictatorship and during the transition to democracy, the Church has since enjoyed concentrated political and social clout. The Church's position in the modern period, both politically and culturally, is incredibly influential. In the modern period, the Church's Pro Family campaign exerts significant influence on reproductive health policy. Using interview data from original fieldwork conducted in Chile, respondents were asked about their opinions on sexuality, reproductive health, public politics, and the influence of the Catholic Church regarding these issues. This study gives specific attention to the nuclear family structure, sexual education in schools, reproductive choice and the morning after pill. In line with Foucauldian notions of the micro-physics of power and the concept of bio-power, this study concludes that the influence of the Catholic Church on reproductive health policy is discriminatory against women and creates a barrier to reproductive health care services in Chile

Messianic Judaism as a mode of fundamentalist authenticity : grammar of authenticity through ethnography of a contested identity
This paper considers how Messianic Jews understand their faith as a unique form of authenticity. On one level, both Messianic Jewish claims of authenticity and critics of Messianic authenticity reflect the same semiotic logic of what I call the "evaluative grammar of authenticity." The evaluative grammar of authenticity values causal/metonymic indexes over manipulated symbols and is undergirded by a suspicion that general appearances are symbolically manipulated in order to mask actual indexical underpinnings. This paper argues that the strong stance on Messianic Jewish authenticity in this community is facilitated by the employment of the evaluative grammar of authenticity within a model of reality strongly influenced by the eschatology and epistemology of American Christian fundamentalism. The indexical underpinnings of the cosmos within this model of reality make it logical to conceive of the Messianic Jewish movement as a unique manifestation of authentic biblical religion. This mode of authenticity is briefly compared to that reflected in the discourse of critics of Messianic Jewish authenticity who tend to employ this evaluative grammar within a more natural/ historical model of reality. This ethnographic example is useful for exploring some of the basic contours of conflicts over authenticity, including how the value-laden domains of knowledge and agency are implicated in these conflicts. It also illustrates how the evaluative grammar of authenticity exemplifies a shared cultural value that, due to its internal logic, tends to engender division and cultural heterogeneity as much, or more, than it engenders cultural consensus

Forging an Ascetic Planet: Jesuit Lives and Virtues on the Mission Frontier of Eighteenth-Century New Spain
This work examines how a uniquely Jesuit ascetic ideal, or will to power over the self and others, developed on the Spanish-American frontier and was represented in Jesuit-authored hagiographies and natural histories in both New Spain and the metropole during the eighteenth century. As missionaries and prolific authors, the Jesuits were crucial to the expansion and representation of the frontiers of New Spain; likewise, the Spanish-American mission frontier was essential to Jesuit subjectivity as a space of meaningful action where the missionary could perform the ideal of ascetic conduct preserved in Christian tradition. Through the performance of this ideal and the production of missionary narratives and natural histories, the Jesuits bridged the ascetic ideal and the inner-worldly exercise of self-discipline and social control that is central to theories of modernity. The idealized representation of the Jesuit subject's conduct not only reaffirmed the order's corporate identity but also actualized a political and cultural hegemony through narratives that served as a medium for establishing value orientations in all strata of Novohispanic society. Originating in the Society's tradition of "Edifying Letters," eighteenth-century Jesuit narratives increasingly turned towards more detailed accounts of individual subjects' lives and reiterated a common narrative structure covering their early childhood, education within the order, work as teachers and finally the fulfillment of their apostolic vocation on the frontier. This phenomenon is observable in the boom of Jesuit-authored missionary hagiographies appearing in New Spain from 1725 until the expulsion of the order in 1767, coinciding with the Society's most embattled period in both New Spain and Europe. The proliferation of works representing individual missionaries' "vidas y virtudes" was accompanied by the differentiation of missionary biography from Jesuit-authored natural histories, which increasingly focused on a secular European reading public. Nevertheless, both genres reflect the enactment of the Jesuit ascetic ideal in distinct value spheres of colonial and European modernity: while the biography of the exemplary missionary responded to the imperatives of social control and the ethical rationalization of the colonial order, Jesuit natural history presupposed an ascetic subject that increasingly pursued knowledge of the natural world as an end in itself.
