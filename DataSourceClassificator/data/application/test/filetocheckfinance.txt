Do Cash Transfers Improve Birth Outcomes? Evidence from Matched Vital Statistics, Program and Social Security Data
There is limited empirical evidence on whether cash social assistance to poor pregnant women improves children’s birth outcomes. Using program administrative micro-data matched to longitudinal vital statistics on the universe of births in Uruguay, we estimate that participation in a generous cash transfer program led to a sizeable 15 to 17% reduction in the incidence of low birth weight. Improvements in mother nutrition and a fall in labor supply, out-of-wedlock births and mother’s smoking all appear to contribute to this effect. Effects are not driven by changes in fertility. We conclude that, by improving child health, cash transfers may help break the cycle of intergenerational poverty.

The general equilibrium of tax and expenditure limits
This dissertation analyzes the effectiveness of tax and expenditure limits. I contend that these limits are frequently implemented unfaithfully. Further, the politics of circumvention used to evade these limits causes unintended secondary and tertiary effects. To understand the policy implementation process, I apply principal-agent theory. The first chapter of my dissertation analyzes the effectiveness of tax and expenditure limits empirically. I pay close attention to pitfalls of time-series, cross- sectional data. Specifically, I account for violations of Guass-Markov caused by serial correlation or heteroskedasticity. I employ flexible TEL indicators to test for temporary and heterogeneous effects of the limits. In the second chapter I leverage two conditions previously shown to produce successful delegation to agents from the principal-agent literature. I apply each condition to the case of tax and expenditure limits and test whether or not limits are more effective when these conditions are met. My results show that tax and expenditure limits are more successfully when implemented by agents that share ideological convictions for cutting the size of government. I also present suggestive evidence that making limits easier to monitor makes them more effective. My third chapter focuses on the secondary and tertiary consequences of tax and expenditure limits. Specifically, I present evidence that property tax limits have detrimental effects on state and local revenues during recessions. Property tax limits cause states to rely on income-elastic revenue sources which cause greater revenue declines during economic downturns. Finally, my fourth chapter is a case study of Massachusetts' 1980 Property Tax Limit, Proposition 2 1/2. This initiative limits municipal property taxes to growth by 2.5% per year. In this chapter I look at the formula used to calculate the limit, highlighting how changes to this formula over time have made the limit less effective. I also analyze the extent to which revenue substitution, such as increases in state aid and charges and the extent to which revenue substitution, such as increases in state aid and charges and fees, can be attributed to the property tax limit

Geography and Public Infrastructure
This paper examines the possibility of negative output spillovers from public infrastructure. A model of productive public capital shows that, when input factors are mobile, public infrastructure investments in one location can draw production away from other locations. In a linear production function framework, this effect would be manifested as a negative output spillover from public capital. Using data for California counties from 1969 through 1988, such negative spillover effects are shown to exist in the case of highway and street capital. The data show that changes in county output are positively associated with changes in highway and street capital within the same county, but output changes are negatively associated with changes in highway and street capital in other counties.

Optimal Insurance with Costly Internal Capital
We introduce costly internal capital into a standard insurance model, in which a risk-averse policy holder buys insurance from a risk-neutral insurer with limited liability. We show that the optimal contract is unique, and leads to a positive probability for insurer default. Some risks are uninsurable, in the sense that it is optimal for the insurer not to provide insurance against such risks. We characterize when such situations arise, as a function of the properties of the risk, the cost of internal capital, and the policy holder's utility function. An increase in the cost of capital may lead to a higher optimal amount of internal capital. The results continue to hold when there are multiple policy holders who are exposed to identical risks. This extension of the classical model to include costly internal capital provides a fruitful approach to many real world insurance markets.

Tax Savings as a Provision of Corporate Welfare is a State-Corporate Crime When it Becomes Socially Injurious
This study focuses on the corporate welfare provided by the US government to corporations despite their high profits and argues that the significant and negative consequences to the federal and state tax bases of such welfare make it a state corporate crime.  Failure to stabilize or rollback corporate welfare initiatives has resulted in a significant decrease in the percentage of federal and state revenue that comes from corporate tax contributions.  I use structural equation modeling to analyze the consequences of corporate welfare initiatives on the federal tax base and the California state tax base.  Drawing insights from an integrated theory of state-corporate crime developed by Kauzlarich and Kramer (1998), I examine various forms of deviance and collusion between corporations and the federal government.  Specifically, this study explores this collusion on two levels: the structural and organizational levels. That is, I focus on the period before, during and after the implementation of corporate welfare initiatives and the organizational environment of the two groups involved.  This study reveals that the federal government facilitated state corporate crime in this case by continuing to provide tax breaks, investment incentives, and loans to corporations despite the high yield in corporate profits, declining corporate tax contributions, high delinquency rates on loans, and the continuous outsourcing of jobs. Because of the lack of government oversight, or deregulation, corporations were able to take advantage of the tax-exempt restructuring offered by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and Revenue Act of 1987, and tax credits beginning with Economic Recovery Act of 1981. This resulted in social harms that were associated with declining tax contributions to state and federal governments, namely a growing deficit, cutbacks in vital social services, and an increased tax burden among individual taxpayers.

This thesis is an analysis of Nigeria's governance of its natural resource funds (NRF). The first half will discuss the unique challenges faced by oil producing countries in managing their resource revenues and provide an overview of Nigeria's lackluster track record in this respect. Then, the role of sovereign wealth funds (SWF), in particular natural resource funds (NRF) in mitigating some of these challenges will be examined.  The second half of this thesis focuses on Nigeria's management of its previous NRF, the Excess Crude Account, and analyzes the strength and weaknesses of the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) Act, the legislation that established the countries three new NRFs and the government entity to manage them.  I conclude by offering pragmatic recommendations on how to improve the NSIA, which is under legal dispute.

Towards this goal, we first give a formal definition of <italic>liquidityadaptation,</italic>. that captures this intuition.

We will show that in return for liquidity adaptation, we must trade off information accuracy. A detailed discussion about this trade-off then follows. We will also define <italic>asymptotic profit rate</italic> that represent the ability of the market to make a profit in a long run. Finally we discuss the design of \emph{optimal market} that maximize worst case liquidity level given information accuracy and profit rate requirements.

[strategy, judgment, commitment, moral, motivational]

Breakdown of morality
My dissertation has three main parts. In the first I develop a commitment model of moral judgment. I argue that moral judgments and the broader discourse in which they take place can be understood in terms of the operation of distinct but interacting commitment strategies. To a first approximation, these strategies operate at the levels of individual and social psychology, and biological and/or cultural evolution. All commitment strategies provide motivational stability by reducing one's (perceived) flexibility of action. Some such strategies are undertaken deliberately, such as when an addict signs a contract forcing her to donate money to a despised organization if she is caught using. However, the commitment strategies associated with moral judgments are rarely if ever conscious or deliberate. In fact, a central aspect of my thesis is that the peculiar motivational power of moral judgments is importantly connected to their power to deflect attention away from our actual motivations and values, and that this motivational strategy is undermined by an awareness of its workings

Model Uncertainty and the Management of a System of Infrastructure Facilities
The network-level infrastructure management problem involves selecting and scheduling Maintenance, Repair, and Rehabilitation (MR&R) activities on networks of infrastructure facilities so as to maintain the level of service provided by the network in a cost-effective manner. This problem is frequently formulated as a Markov Decision Problem (MDP) solved via Linear Programming (LP). The conditions of facilities are represented by elements of discrete condition rating sets, and transition probabilities are employed to describe deterioration processes. Epistemic and parametric uncertainties not considered within the standard MDP/LP framework are associated with the transition probabilities used in infrastructure management optimization routines. This paper contrasts the expected costs incurred when model uncertainty is ignored with those incurred when this uncertainty is explicitly considered using Robust Optimization. A case study involving a network-level pavement management MDP/LP problem demonstrates how explicitly considering uncertainty may limit worst case MR&R expenditures. The methods and results can also be used to identify the costs of uncertainty in transition probability matrices used in infrastructure management systems.

The Transformation of Mortgage Finance and the Industrial Roots of the Mortgage Meltdown
The 2007-2009 financial crisis was centered on the mortgage industry. This paper develops a distinctly sociological explanation of that crisis based on Fligstein’s (1996) markets as politics approach and the sociology of finance. We use archival and secondary sources to show that the industry became dominated by an “industrial” conception of control whereby financial firms vertically integrated in order to capture profits in all phases of the mortgage industry including the production of financial products. The results of multivariate regression analyses show that the “industrial” model drove the deterioration in the quality of securities that firms issued and significantly contributed to the eventual failure of the firms that pursued the strategy. We show that large global banks which were more involved in the industrial production of U.S. mortgage securities also experienced greater investment losses. The findings challenge existing conventional accounts of the crisis and provide important theoretical linkages to the sociology of finance

The Institution of Infrastructure and the Development of Port-Regions
This dissertation asks what role local public agencies might play in regional economic development through the market-shaping institutions they create and sustain. Recent economic geography literature has sought to account for patterns of regional development in terms of institutional differences across space. Research has sought to identify and understand these institutions, defined as taken for granted formal and informal rules, practices, norms and patterns of behavior. However, the current literature is vague about the role of public policy, and often ignores extra-regional economic forces.
      This dissertation confronts these problems directly by examining the institutionalized relationship between one type of local public agency, port authorities, and one global industry, automobile manufacturers. The evidence presented in this dissertation consists of case studies of two public port authorities (Baltimore and Long Beach) and various automobile importers (Toyota, Honda, Mercedes and Volkswagen), supported by documentary and economic data. The research strategy involves tracing the consequences for the geography of automobile import activity of institutional change in public ports.
      I argue that the economic geography of automobile import and distribution activities can be systematically related to changes in the planning, leasing, pricing, and management policies of US public port authorities. Firms using such public infrastructure seek a relational fix, or an appropriate set of institutionalized relationships, that allows them to overcome the uncertainties associated with investment and other economic actions. How port authorities go about providing infrastructure -- the planning policies they promote, the financing mechanisms they employ, the contracts they enter into, the labor relations they sustain, the organizations they create -- these institutions all support particular relational fixes and devalue others. Changes in these institutions arising from the process of containerization have changed the actual and potential relationships between infrastructure providers and users. In turn, this influenced both the patterns of port usage and infrastructure investment decisions.
      The findings indicate the local public agencies are able to influence regional economic development outcomes through attention to the institutions governing the relationships between multinational firms and other economic actors. A central challenge for local public agencies is to achieve institutional compatibility with a diversity of economic actors, in a way that is both responsive to changes in industry organization and accountable to local communities. For planners in particular, this implies paying closer attention to the way in which institutions influence actual and potential public-private relationships.

Robust Maintenance Policies in Asset Management
Asset management systems help public works agencies decide when and how to maintain and rehabilitate infrastructure facilities in a cost-effective manner. Many sources of error, some difficult to quantify, can limit the ability of asset management systems to accurately predict how built systems will deteriorate. This paper introduces the use of robust optimization to deal with epistemic uncertainty. The Hurwicz criterion is employed to ensure management policies are never ‘too conservative.’ An efficient solution algorithm is developed to solve robust counterparts of the asset management problem. A case study demonstrates how the consideration of uncertainty alters optimal management policies and shows how the proposed approach may reduce maintenance and rehabilitation (M&R) expenditures.

Networks, deregulation, and risk : the politics of critical infrastructure protection
The dissertation, "Networks, Deregulation, and Risk: The Politics of Critical Infrastructure Protection," engages post-9/11 debates over the role of public policy and novel technologies in crafting and maintaining resilient infrastructure networks against the threat of terrorism. In the wake of the terrorist attacks of 9/11, networks of communication, electric power, and transportation (as well as others) became sites of anxiety, debate, and, ultimately, intervention. The dissertation examines three separate infrastructures--the postal system, freight rail transportation, and the electric power grid--and considers the ways in which new regulations and technologies of control are introduced in an effort to counter the presumed disruptive impacts of terrorism. The study follows two related lines of inquiry: First, it examines the relationship between deregulation--the selective and incomplete restructuring of infrastructure regulation in deference to the market--and infrastructure vulnerability; Second, it considers how after 9/11 a cross-section of actors from inside and outside the sphere of traditional national security policymaking intervene in defining the terms on which critical infrastructure protection unfolds. The dissertation argues that deregulation, despite its other merits, creates new forms of infrastructure vulnerability. Critically, the partial deregulation of price-and-entry controls over infrastructure operations transformed the architecture of these networks in ways that make infrastructures both more efficient and more vulnerable to large-scale failure. By foregrounding the role of policy and law in shaping infrastructure networks, the dissertation demonstrates how previous regulatory regimes provided a hedge against large-scale failure and how deregulation, unintentionally, conspired to create networks beset by vulnerabilities. Additionally, the dissertation highlights the surprising conclusion that in the aftermath of 9/11 the perceived risk of terrorism ultimately contributes to the democratization of infrastructure governance. Drawing from the work of Ulrich Beck and notions of securitization, the dissertation examines how risk serves as a resource for otherwise marginalized interest groups to open infrastructure governance to a range of voices. In the reviewed cases, risk does not serve to support the suspension or diminution of democratic practices, but on the contrary enlivens particular aspects of practices of democracy

The Impact of Transportation Infrastructure on the Value of Time
In this dissertation economic values time of are estimated as a function of public transportation infrastructure. These results provide insight into the value of improvements in transportation infrastructure that can be useful to policymakers who need to consider the value of time saved when looking at the optimal allocation of transportation projects. This research contributes to our understanding of the value of time and in particular how the value of time is impacted by current levels of transportation infrastructure.
      To analyze the value of time as a function of transportation infrastructure a combination of Geographical Information Systems (GIS), US census and survey data is employed. Empirical random utility maximization models in a mixed logit (MXL) framework are developed consistent with time and money‐constrained choices. Both revealed preference (actual choice) and stated preference (hypothetical choice) models are analyzed.
      The use of an internet based survey for this dissertation was especially important. In particular, the use of the internet based survey guaranteed that answers for questions related to time spent on various activities during the respondent’s day added up to 24 hours. This ensured that the models of time developed in this study had a degree of accuracy that is much more difficult to achieve with other survey methods. In addition, the internet based survey made it possible to provide detailed instructions and examples that a respondent could view if she needed a fuller explanation of a particular question. Consequently, the survey employed in this study presented a complex set of questions that were easy for the respondent to answer.
      Three communities are studied including the cities of San Francisco and Sacramento and Sonoma County in Northern California. Specifically, the value of time is modeled as a function of the currently available public transportation infrastructure. As such, the value of time is shown to vary between communities and within communities as a function of the level of transportation infrastructure in the immediate neighborhood of each individual’s home. Using Contingent Valuation Methods (CVM), an economic welfare analysis shows that increases in levels of transit infrastructure have positive economic impacts that vary in relation to the current level of infrastructure.

ESSAYS ON MONETARY POLICY, CHINA'S ECONOMY AND EXCHANGE RATE
This dissertation consists of the three essays that allowed me to investigate three different economics phenomena. The discussion focuses on topics related to U.S. bank deregulation, China's resource misallocation and currency carry-trade strategy. In particularly, the aim is to study how U.S. bank deregulation is related to Great Moderation in U.S. between the mid-1980s and the start of the subprime debt crisis in 2007, what the implication of monetary policy with China's resource misallocation is and how a new carry trade method can be constructed.The first paper models the effect of bank deregulation on the volatility of output and firms dynamics. By introducing a cost channel and bank sector into Bilbiee, Ghironi and Melitz (2007)'s model, we test the volatility change under various shocks before and after bank deregulation. Simulations show that with the bank spread decreases by 1/3, the volatility of output and number of producers decrease significantly. This can provide a potential explanation for why the Great Moderation starts from the mid-1980s to mid-2000s.The second paper constructs a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model of China with heterogeneous sectors and resource misallocation. Recent literature has shown that there is significant resource misallocation between state-owned firms and private firms in China. We find the presence of resource misallocation alters standard monetary policy conclusions in important ways. We show that there is an additional real effect of monetary policy--- an allocation effect. This is different from the standard New Keynesian framework, where the real effect comes from the price rigidity. Monetary policy shocks also exert heterogeneous effects on private firms and state-owned firms. Given a common shock, the output volatility of private firms is higher than that of state-owned firms. The model can easily be extended to other developing countries with similar situations.The third paper employs two methods to construct a portfolio for carry trade strategy. The first one is the minimal variance, subject to specific return and weights constraints. The other is the maximal R square, subject to the weights constraints. Using MATLAB, we can calculate the optimal weights, returns and Sharpe ratio for these two methods. By comparing the Sharpe ratio for different time intervals, we find that the overall maximal R square strategy is relatively more accurate than the minimal variances strategy. This provides an alternative method to construct a carry trade portfolio.

Privatization's Progeny
Privatization’s proponents are branching out.  They’ve traditionally relied on government contracting to boost regulatory efficiency, maximize budgetary savings, enhance unitary control over the administrative state, and reap political dividends.  Now, however, these proponents are also blazing newer, bolder paths.  They’re experimenting with more powerful instruments that offer surer, quicker routes to promote privatization’s aims. 
      One such instrument is marketized bureaucracy.  For decades, the government offered its employees generous base compensation and considerable job security.  During that time, privatization’s proponents found these public-sector arrangements anathema.  Rather than tear down the then-prized civil-service framework, they simply circumvented it — replacing what they viewed as overpaid and insufficiently motivated government workers with contractors.  Of late, however, the tide has turned against the civil service.  Across the country, elected officials are reducing government workers’ wages and benefits, curtailing collective-bargaining rights, reclassifying tenured civil servants as at-will employees, and introducing performance-based bonuses.  These efforts have made government bureaucracy far more like the private sector, thus reducing the need to contract out. 
      Another such instrument is government by bounty.  Exemplified by regulatory vouchers, prediction markets, R&D prizes, and social-impact bonds, government-by-bounty initiatives shed the conventional contractual form.  In its stead are high-risk, high-reward bets that shift financial and programmatic responsibility onto bounty seekers.  Unlike traditional contractors, bounty seekers invest their own money and get paid only if they win the "bet" — that is, only if they successfully carry out their given tasks.  As a result, the bounty seekers are, in theory, better-motivated and less susceptible to slack, abuse, and fraud.
      This Article explores how these instruments uniquely challenge the administrative state, reorienting public programs, reversing longstanding practices, and forcing courts to recalibrate core administrative law doctrines in ways traditional contracting never did.  Specifically, these new instruments enable school districts to “teach to the test,” states to barter away sovereign authority, and presidents to politicize the bureaucracy.  They also test the robustness of foundational legal precepts undergirding hard-look review, Chevron and Skidmore deference, and constitutional due process.  Ultimately, the emergence of these instruments reflects the extent to which government today is commingling political and business-like agendas in ways both liberating and threatening.

Information and Inference in Econometrics: Estimation, Testing and Forecasting
Economic and Financial phenomena convey enormous information about the underlying structure of economic and policy interest. The first objective of the thesis is mainly concerned with how to make use of information efficiently, specifically, (1) how to separate noises from useful information in the presence of large dimensional data, (2) how to incorporate prior information (economic constraint), and (3) how to employ model structure, to conduct more informed inference, and thus to understand the economic structure wisely and draw sound policy conclusions.The second dimension of information refers to the recent developments in the information theory that measure how much information content the observed data contains. The formalism of Maximum Entropy provides an information-theoretic approach to tackle economic problems, especially those with data observed in aggregate terms. Thus, the second objective of the thesis is to make use of this line of research and develop a new estimation method to measure quantities of economic interest when researchers are faced with model uncertainty.

Combating healthcare corruption and fraud with improved global health governance
Abstract
				Corruption is a serious threat to global health outcomes, leading to financial waste and adverse health consequences. Yet, forms of corruption impacting global health are endemic worldwide in public and private sectors, and in developed and resource-poor settings alike. Allegations of misuse of funds and fraud in global health initiatives also threaten future investment. Current domestic and sectorial-level responses are fragmented and have been criticized as ineffective. In order to address this issue, we propose a global health governance framework calling for international recognition of &#8220;global health corruption&#8221; and development of a treaty protocol to combat this crucial issue.

Commercial Property Value and Proximity to Light Rail: A Hedonic Price Application
When the public sector sponsors projects to promote general welfare, disproportionate benefits or disproportionate burdens often fall on individuals. In Santa Clara County, California, private property owners claimed a burden due to the existence of a light rail transit system (LRT). Looking at rental rates for commercial property this research tests several hedonic specifications to determine what effect, if any, the LRT has on proximate property values; it compares transit accessibility with highway accessibility as determinants of rent; and it uses a series of hedonic indices to analyze the effects over time. Traditionally, hedonic price models have relied on sale price as the variable of interest. Rental rates, which are both more abundant and more dynamic, thus more sensitive to changes in the market, are used in place of sale price. The substitution allows for more robust models.
      Results indicate that controlling for other factors, properties that lie within 1/2 a mile of a light rail station command a higher lease rate than other properties in the County. When controlling for highway access, the rail proximity benefit was maintained and it was shown that highway coverage in the County is adequately dense that there are no particular locational advantages associated with highway coverage. Furthermore, as the transit system matured a greater benefit accrued to the proximate properties but in times of more intense general market pressure, the rent premium was dampened.

Economy, Community and Law: The Turnpike Movement in New York, 1797-1845
Turnpike companies were the exemplary type of early American business corporation: they were the most prevalent, they were the most community laden, and they were unprofitable. The turnpike experience enhances our understanding of the evolution of the law of private and public corporations.
      We explain that the state turned to the private sector for highway management because of intense commercial and regional rivalries and the failure of public alternatives.
      Private management and toll-taking were startling innovations to some members of the community, however, and they protested the introduction of turnpikes. The bete noires of "private corporation" and "aristocracy" were often used to denounce turnpikes. The legislature both expressed and responded to these suspicions by writing laws favorable to local users and damaging to the financial viability of the companies.
      Partly in consequence of the unfavorable laws turnpikes were unprofitable. Merchants, farmers, and landowners struggled to finance turnpikes, not in hopes of company dividends, but in hopes of improved transportation, stimulated commerce, and higher land values. Many turnpike projects were stillborn while those that were constructed hobbled along in a precarious financial state.

Tactical Portfolio Construction
Modern portfolio theory says that unsystematic risk can always be diversified away. Although it is unrealistic to achieve perfect diversification, people developed different strategies trying to find an optimal portfolio. In this paper, issues of how to make a diversified portfolio are discussed. Six models of tactical portfolio construction strategies are used to make the optimal portfolios using the historical data from Jan. 2007 to Dec. 2009. From the out-of-sample test by market data from Jan. 2010 to Dec. 2011, the classic Markowitz portfolio has the highest wealth added. By comparing the portfolio evaluation parameters, Sharpe ratio suits an individual investor most. And Bayesian portfolio with informative prior scores highest by Sharpe ratio regardless its sensitivity to the accurate market prediction. The paper also demonstrates the application of statistical software R and the "stockPortfolio" package in the stock investment field.

The political calculus of congestion pricing
The political feasibility of using prices to mitigate congestion depends on who receives the toll revenue. We argue that congestion pricing on freeways will have the greatest chance of political success if the revenue is distributed to cities, and particularly to cities through which the freeways pass. In contrast to a number of previous proposals, we argue that cities are stronger claimants for the revenue than either individual drivers or regional authorities. We draw on theory from behavioral economics and political science to explain our proposal, and illustrate it with data from several metropolitan areas. In Los Angeles, where potential congestion toll revenues are estimated to be almost $5 billion a year, distributing toll revenues to cities with freeways could be politically effective and highly progressive.

Venture capital returns, new firms and social networks
These chapters study the return of venture capital investments with a focus on outliers and examine the formation of new firms that invest in entrepreneurial companies. First, I formulate a model and estimator of venture capital (VC) returns motivated by the entrepreneurial firm life-cycle and the extreme return outcomes of typical venture capital investments. The model incorporates tail events and the estimator corrects for sample selection bias and endogenous investment holding periods. I find that an asymmetric three-state mixture distribution is a better characterization of returns than the standard single-state model. Mixture states mimic typical VC outcomes : "winners", "break-even" and "failures." Imposing normality on venture capital investment returns understates downside risk and kurtosis. In contrast to earlier studies, the mixture model reveals a leptokurtic, negatively-skewed returns distribution. Next, I investigate the consequences of venture capital employee spinoffs for parent firms and the characteristics of their founders. As predicted by the spinoff formation model of Cabral and Wang (2009), high type partners and low type partners at failing parent firms are the most likely to leave and start a new venture capital firm. After accounting for the endogeneity of the timing of spinoff formation, estimates reveal a large, negative impact of spinoffs on parent firm performance. The results indicate that a renewed focus on the venture capital partner, rather than the whole firm, could reveal new features of venture capital performance. Finally, the source of the competitive advantage of employee spinoff firms and their formation's negative impact on parent firms is often attributed to a transfer of knowledge from parent firm to spinoff. The third chapter studies one potential asset transfer in the venture capital industry that can explain both patterns : social networks. Results comparing the social network evolution of venture capital spinoffs and other new firms show that the former have more central network positions and gain those positions more quickly. Non-spinoffs are more likely to join smaller, more isolated cliques in the network. Spinoffs also have higher survival rates, co-invest with more experienced investors and produce more positive exit outcomes for their investments

Thresholds and the good : a program of political evaluation
Morality requires not only an account of the right, but also of the good. This is well-understood. In this dissertation, I argue that plausible concerns of political morality merit reconsideration of the proper account of the good. Many people believe that political morality ought to take an interest in a basic social minimum, a standard below which no citizens should be allowed to fall. Concern for the welfare of the poorest, however, is well captured by an axiological theory that itself is independently plausible. In this dissertation, I argue that the good displays three features. First, the evaluation of states of affairs ought to reflect strong concern for the achievement of a basic minimum. Second, this basic minimum is part of an independently plausible account of human well-being that grants heavy axiological weight to certain threshold achievements. Third, in evaluating the distribution of threshold achievements, including the basic minimum, the least well-off ought to be given absolute axiological priority. If my account of the good can adequately capture firm intuitions concerning the world's poorest, this is a significant result. However, the interest of this theory goes beyond the political interest in a basic social minimum. I argue that a threshold-laden axiology can solve persistent and troubling worries for any account of value including Lives for Headaches, a troubling conclusion I discuss in Chapter Two. The theory of well-being proposed in Chapter Three is also plausible in the face of popular rival accounts

Accounting for the Relationship of the Financial Position of Private, Baccalaureate-level and Above Institutions to Tuition Discount Rates
Institutions have increased the practice of tuition discounting; that is, the strategic use of price discrimination. During the past 30 years, both the average percent discount given to students and the proportion of students receiving tuition breaks have increased. As this practice has increased, there are financial determinants and implications that must be addressed. The purpose of this study was to provide a thorough investigation of one of the issues embedded within tuition discounting practices: the relationship between an institution's overall financial position and its price discrimination practices. The five component ratios of the financial vulnerability index (FVI)-- debt ratio, revenue concentration index, surplus margin ratio, administrative costs ratio, and size ratio--served as a proxy for institutional financial position. Integrated Postsecondary Educational Data System (IPEDS), The Institute for College Access and Success (TICAS) and Barron's Profiles of American Colleges provided the financial and institutional data for the academic years of 2003-04 to 2007-08. Ordinary least squares regression and analysis of variance were tools used to test the data. There were three main indications in the findings. First, institutional financial position had a relationship to tuition discount rates for stable institutions (FVI < .10). As the FVI decreased for stable institutions, tuition discount rates increased, showing that institutions with financial resources used them to create a class that would further their mission, increase prestige, or a combination of the two. Second, on average, unstable institutions with enrollment decreases over the five-year period did not demonstrate significant changes in discount rates. In this circumstance, unstable institutions had a limit to the amount they could invest in their futures. Third, institutional financial position had a relationship to tuition discount rates for unstable institutions (FVI > .20). As the FVI increased for unstable institutions, tuition discount rates increased, indicating that institutions used their current resources as an investment in the future of the institution. In addition, descriptive statistics were used to understand the relationship between tuition discount rates and the four institutional control variables used in the study: total enrollment, percent white enrollment, percent Pell, and selectivity.

Economic Spillovers of Highway Investment: A Case Study of the Employment Impacts of Interstate 105 in Los Angeles County
Most economists agree that new investments in highways at this point in time in the United States have little impact on overall growth in output. New highways play a more important role in shifting economic activities among places, drawing jobs from other locations into the highway corridors, a phenomenon known as negative spillovers. The objective of this dissertation is two-fold, to examine the proposal to decentralize highway finance, which aims to solve the financial responsibility mismatch problem that stems from economic spillovers of highways, and to test the hypothesis of economic spillovers of highway investment at the metropolitan level. First, to better understand how spillovers influence the highway investment decision, the theoretical framework from the interjurisdictional tax competition literature is borrowed to model governments' investment behaviors. Numerical simulations show that decentralized local governments, which independently maximize output in their own jurisdiction, may engage in wasteful investments in highways with the presence of spillovers. Second, to shed more light on the spatial detail of economic spillovers, empirical tests of the spillover hypothesis are conducted at the metropolitan level, with census tracts as the unit of observation. The results of the quasi-experiment reveal census tract employment growth patterns that confirm the existence of negative spillovers caused by the opening of the Interstate 105 in 1993. The benefiting area, which grew substantially after the highway was opened, is limited to a long narrow corridor around the highway, while nearby locations outside the corridor experienced slow growth relative to the rest of the metropolitan area after controlling for various factors. Together, these results suggest that although negative spillovers are present at the metropolitan level, decentralizing highway finance may not be an effective policy to deal with the financial responsibility mismatch problem. Highway finance should remain centralized within metropolitan areas, and regional governing bodies should pay special attention to the distributional impact of highway projects.

When Barriers to Markets Fail: Pipeline Deregulation, Spot Markets, and the Topology of the Natural Gas Market
Until 184, Federal regulation sanctioned monopoly as the primary mechanism for distributing natural gas. Pipelines were granted protected markets and permitted to acquire and distribute gas only through long-term contracts. To buy or sell gas, users and producers had to deal with the pipeline, they could not deal directly. Gas markets failed to exit. In 1985, pipelines were given the option to become "open access" pipelines who transported gas. This change dissolved the barriers to markets and, for the first time in more than fifty years, authorized competition. In this paper, we observe and evaluate the emergence, evolution and performance of natural gas spot markets in this new environment. We discover that spot markets flourished in the absence of regulatory barriers to their existence; more than fifty spot markets came into existence and quickly replaced long-term contracts and pipelines as sources gas. The spot price evidence reveals that open access changed the topology of the pipeline network: the balkanized and disconnected network of gas markets created by regulation became more strongly connected and spot prices converged and became more correlated throughout the network. By the end of our sample period, gas markets had become liquid and informationally efficient -- demand or supply shocks are strongly damped across the network, and the price at any point contains all the information in the network. The spatially separated spot markets are now so strongly connected that they form a single national market for natural gas.

Essays on time-varying investment opportunities and investors' asset allocation
This dissertation presents three stand-alone contributions to the fields of theoretical and empirical asset pricing. The first chapter presents a theoretical model in which the attention investors pay to the stock market varies over time. This feature is obtained by introducing information costs into a continuous-time model of asset allocation with time-varying investment opportunities. My model explains why investors do not trade uniformly through time. It also rationalizes why agents do not modify their portfolio allocations gradually with the arrival of new information, but rather alternate extended periods of inertia (no-trade) with brief moments of action where asset allocations are updated according to the current state of the economy. The second chapter analyzes the role of information in the context of financial market predictions. I employ a novel semi-parametric method known as Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) to forecast stock returns and volatility at the monthly frequency. The framework allows me to generate forecasts on the basis of a large set of predictor variables without incurring over- fitting related problems. My results indicate that expanding the conditioning information set results in greater out-of-sample predictive accuracy compared to the standard models proposed in the literature and that the forecasts generate profitable portfolio allocations even when market frictions are considered. The third chapter (co-authored with Allan Timmermann) analyzes the limitations of parametric models in evaluating the relation between risk and return. By taking advantage of the flexible and semi-parametric nature of Boosted Regression Trees, we find evidence of a nonmonotonic relation between conditional volatility and expected stock market returns. At low and medium levels of conditional volatility there is a positive risk-return trade-off, but this relation is inverted at high levels of volatility. This finding helps explain the absence of a consensus in the empirical literature on the sign of the risk-return trade-off. We propose a new measure of risk based on the conditional covariance between observations of a broad economic activity index and stock market returns. Using this broader covariance-based risk measure, we find clear evidence of a positive and monotonic risk-returns trade- off

Capital flows: Catalyst or Hindrance to economic takeoffs?
This paper applies a probit estimation to assess the relationship between economic takeoffs during 1950-2000 and inflows of portfolio debt, portfolio equity, and FDI, controlling for country’s stock of short-termexternal debt and commodity terms of trade. Average level of FDI inflows is associated with a 23 percenthigher takeoff probability relative to a zero FDI inflow benchmark, and this effect is highest for the LatinAmerica subsample, with a 65 rise in takeoff probability. Higher stock of short term external debt hasbeen associated with a substantial negative effect on the probability of a takeoff, and the effect of theshort terms debt overhang is largest for Latin American countries. Yet, virtually all the takeoffs wereassociated with a rise in portfolio debt inflows. At the sample mean, inflow of portfolio debt is associatedwith approximately 25 percent higher probability of a takeoff. In contrast, a one standard deviationincrease in equity outflows (inflows) is associated with a 47 percent (17 percent) decline in the probabilityof a takeoff. A one standard deviation improvement in commodity terms of trade is associated with 28percent higher takeoff probability.

Uncertainty in Infrastructure Deterioration Modeling and Robust Maintenance Policies for Markovian Management Systems
Infrastructure management systems help public works agencies decide when and how to maintain, repair, and rehabilitate infrastructure facilities in a cost effective manner. An integral part of an infrastructure management system is a model describing how the different infrastructure facilities to be managed deteriorate over time and with use. Many sources of error limit the ability of management systems to accurately predict how built systems will deteriorate. This dissertation introduces and examines different techniques for considering error and uncertainty in deterioration modeling within an infrastructure management system.
      Techniques used include robust optimization and adaptive control. In the context of robust optimization, both MAXIMIN and Hurwicz decision criteria are studied. Computational studies involving the simulated management of pavement systems illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approaches. These studies involve short-term, limited horizon planning, as well as indefinite-term, infinite horizon planning. Single facility infrastructure management problems are presented alongside more complex problems involving the management of a network of an arbitrarily large number of related facilities.
      It is found that both robust optimization and adaptive control formulations have certain comparative advantages. Some discussion is included of the possibility of combining the robust and adaptive frameworks to create a new hybrid approach. Regardless of what approach is used, this work makes clear that consideration of uncertainty in deterioration modeling during decision-making can alter ‘optimal’ maintenance strategies selected and change the potential user and agency costs of infrastructure management.

Three Essays on Creative Destruction
This dissertation aims to advance our knowledge of long-run economic changes. It consists of three essays on strategic industry dynamics in retail services, agricultural commodities, and high-tech manufacturing, respectively. Although creative destruction is commonly understood as the replacement of old technologies by new ones, its true significance lies not in the transition of technologies <italic>per se</italic> but in either the reluctance or inability of old winners to innovate when faced with new challengers. Hence I emphasize the incumbent-entrant rivalry as the common theme across these essays.Essay 1 assesses the impact of the entry of large supermarkets on incumbents of various sizes. Contrary to the conventional notion that big stores drive small rivals out of the market, data from Tokyo in the 1990s show that large supermarkets' entry induces the exit of existing large and medium-size competitors, but <italic>improves</italic> the survival rate of small supermarkets. These findings highlight the role of store size as an important dimension of product differentiation and caution against size-based entry regulations.Essay 2 studies the impact of international market structure on commodity prices, using a standard oligopoly model and exploiting historical variations in the structure of the international coffee bean market. The results suggest that, of the 75% drop in the real coffee price between 1988 and 2001, the end of a cartel treaty explains 49 points and the emergence of Vietnam as a major exporter explains another 9 points. I then discuss policy implications for competition, trade, and aid.Essay 3 investigates why incumbent firms innovate more slowly than entrants. Theories predict cannibalization between existing and new products delays incumbents' innovation, whereas preemptive motives accelerate it, and incumbents' cost (dis)advantage would further reinforce these tendencies. To empirically quantify these three forces, I develop and estimate a dynamic oligopoly model using a unique panel dataset of hard disk drive (HDD) manufacturers (1981&ndash98). The results suggest that despite strong preemptive motives and a substantial cost advantage over entrants, incumbents are reluctant to innovate because of cannibalization, which can explain at least 51% of the incumbent-entrant timing gap. I then discuss managerial and public-policy implications.

The impact of news on monetary policy expectations
Expectations of future monetary policy are a crucial determinant of asset prices. This dissertation provides answers to the question how newly available information, such as news about the future stance of monetary policy or about the macroeconomic situation, affects these expectations. The first chapter characterizes how interest rates react to monetary policy actions and macroeconomic news. The second chapter decomposes interest rate changes into revisions of monetary policy expectations and changes in term premia, with the result that most high-frequency variation in interest rates is accounted for by expectations of future monetary policy. The third chapter targets the question what drives the revisions of nominal short rate expectations and documents an important role for inflation expectations

The Emergence of a Finance Culture in American Households, 1989-2007
As the financial economy has expanded beginning in the mid 1980s, it has done so in part by selling more products to individuals and households, such as mortgages, second mortgages, mutual funds, student loans, car loans, insurance, and various forms of retirement products. This has allowed households access to new forms of assets and debts and new ways to fund their lifestyles. This giant expansion of the financial services sector occurred at the same time that income inequality and job insecurity increased dramatically in the U.S. This paper seeks to tease out empirically the relationship between these trends by examining data on the activities of households in the past 20 years. There are two views, one that focuses on how households reacted defensively to preserve their lifestyles and the other which focuses on households developing a more financial mindset to the management of their assets, debt, and consumption and thereby using the new opportunities to invest and borrow money to increase their consumption. We show some support for both views. The use of financial products and debt has increased at all levels of the income distribution. Attitudes toward risk and indebtedness have generally become more lax. But, there is also evidence that people at the top of the income distribution are using their growing income to consume more while people lower down are struggling to keep up. The meaning of new financial culture is quite different depending on where you stand in the income hierarchy.

Sucker Punched by the Invisible Hand
The worldwide financial crisis of 2007-2010 was set off by the collapse of the subprime mortgage market in the U.S. This crisis caused widespread banking failure in the U.S. and forced the federal government to provide a massive bailout to the financial sector. The crisis simultaneously reverberated to banks around the world, and eventually brought about a worldwide recession. This paper documents why Western European countries were so susceptible to the housing price downturn. We explore various mechanisms by which the financial crisis might have spread including the existence of similar regulatory schemes, government deficits and current account imbalances, export connectedness, and the presence of a housing bubble. We present a surprising result: European banks went down because they had joined the market in the U.S. for mortgage backed securities and funded them by borrowing in the asset backed commercial paper market. They were pursuing the same strategies to make profit as the American banks, and when the housing market turned down, they suffered the same fate as their U.S. counterparts. Our study makes a broader theoretical point suggesting that subsequent studies of global finance and financial markets need to know something about the identities and strategies of the banks that structure the main markets for different products. This insight has implications for the literatures on financialization, globalization, and the sociology of finance.

Manifesting Exchange
Exchange is at the core of public space. Whether trading products or sharing information, exchange between people produces social interactions and spatialized hubs of activity. Without exchange public spaces fail. 
	Today, the Internet threatens older methods of spatialized exchange as people communicate through email, pay bills electronically, and shop online. These despatialized forms of exchange are having a damaging impact on previously functioning public spaces such as the post office and retail stores. Distribution centers, meanwhile, are thriving as product exchange points but they remain completely invisible and inaccessible to the customer. 
	With the United States Postal Service in rapid decline, once monumental buildings will soon be abandoned. Taking advantage of the existing infrastructure of post offices, I am proposing a centrally located public distribution center; giving online companies a physical presence in the city, monumentalizing the currently despatialized market, and reintroducing the public to the exchange process.

Changes in the Economic Value of Variable Generation at High Penetration Levels: A Pilot Case Study of California
We estimate the long-run economic value of variable renewable generation with increasing penetration using a unique investment and dispatch model that captures long-run investment decisions while also incorporating detailed operational constraints and hourly time resolution over a full year. High time resolution and the incorporation of operational constraints are important for
 estimating the economic value of variable generation, as is the use of a  modeling framework that accommodates new investment decisions.  The model is herein applied with a case study that is loosely based on California in 2030. Increasing amounts of wind, photovoltaics (PV), and concentrating solar power (CSP) with and without thermal energy storage (TES) are added one at a time.   The marginal economic value of these renewable energy sources is estimated
 and then decomposed into capacity value, energy value, day-ahead forecast error cost, and ancillary services.  The marginal economic value, as defined  here, is primarily based on the combination of avoided capital investment cost and avoided variable fuel and operations and maintenance costs from other power plants in the power system. Though the model only captures a subset of the benefits and costs of renewable energy, it nonetheless provides unique insights into how the value of that subset changes with technology and penetration level. 

Specifically, in this case study implementation of the model, the marginal economic value of all three solar options is found to exceed the value of a flat-block of power (as well as wind energy) by \$20--30/MWh at low penetration levels, largely due to the high capacity value of solar 
at low penetration.  Because the value of CSP per unit of energy is found to be high with or 
without thermal energy storage at low penetration, we find little apparent incremental value to thermal storage at low solar penetration in the present case study analysis. The marginal economic value of PV and CSP without thermal storage is found to drop considerably (by more than \$70/MWh) as the penetration of solar increases toward 30\percent on an energy basis.  This is 
due primarily to a steep drop in capacity value followed by a decrease in energy value.  In contrast, the value of CSP with thermal storage drops much less dramatically as penetration increases.  As a result, at solar penetration levels above 10\percent, CSP with thermal storage is found to be considerably more valuable relative to PV and CSP without thermal storage. The marginal economic value of wind is found to be largely driven by energy value, and is lower than solar at low penetration. The marginal economic value of wind drops at a relatively slower rate with penetration, however.  As a result, at high penetration, the value of wind can exceed the value of PV and CSP without thermal storage. Though some of these findings may be somewhat  unique to the specific case study presented here, the results: (1) highlight the importance of an analysis framework that addresses long-term investment decisions as well as short-term dispatch and operational constraints, (2) can help inform long-term decisions about renewable energy procurement and supporting infrastructure, and (3) point to areas where further research 
is warranted.

[firm, decision, access, offer, information, quality, interest, maker, group]

Three essays concerning information transmission
The first paper investigates how interest groups use private information to influence policy decisions. A primary observation is that access to the decision maker is necessary for information transmission, and in many situations, this access is not free. Furthermore, payments directed at securing access must be committed before the ultimate outcome is determined. The decision maker's welfare depends on both these monetary payments and on how much information is transmitted. He may restrict access in order to advance these potentially contradictory objectives. Only those interest groups' which commit sufficient resources will be granted access, and be in a position to influence the ultimate decision. The model is consistent with the observations that the rents generated by policy choices may not be completely dissipated, and relatively few interest groups find participation profitable. The sensitivity of the results to the specification of the decision maker's preferences and the information structure is also investigated. The second paper considers the feedback mechanism between firms' efforts to screen potential employees and the quality of the labor pool. The model displays a complementarity: where available workers are of lower quality on average, firms will optimally commit more resources to hiring only the most qualified. More stringent screening returns more under-qualified workers to the unemployed pool, which further lowers its quality. This framework allows us to consider the impact of changes in the environment, e.g., the introduction of web-based testing services which lowers the cost of screening potential employees. The final paper investigates the job-offer decisions of ranked institutions. The motivation is the academic job market, where differences in prestige between schools is well known. Firms cheaply learn something about a candidate's quality through an interview, but actually making an offer is costly in terms of opportunity cost. We show that a lower ranked firm will want to take a "flier" on the best candidates, even though they are the most likely to attract a better offer. When the firms can delay making offers, the lower-ranked firm prefers to wait to make offers until after the higher-ranked firm has made its offers

Essays on the politics of regulation
This dissertation consists of an introductory chapter and three distinct yet thematically related papers. The purpose of the dissertation is to explain variation in regulatory policy across countries by highlighting the institutional (supply) and interest group (demand) determinants of policy. I develop and test theory explaining regulatory policy outcomes at several levels of analysis. Chapter 1 introduces the topic and related literature. Chapter 2 focuses on the supply of regulatory policy by examining how political institutions affect the responsiveness of policymakers to consumer interests. I argue that the political influence of consumers depends on the level of democracy. To test the theory, I develop an original dataset measuring competition agency design in 156 developing countries covering the period 1975-2007. I estimate hazard models on the timing of competition policy reform. I also create an original index of governments' commitments to antitrust policy and estimate its political determinants. The results confirm a link between democracy and the commitment to consumer-friendly regulatory policy. Chapter 3 holds institutions constant in order to examine the demand-side determinants of regulatory policy outcomes within democracies. I argue that competition policy enforcement reflects the relative political strength of two contending interest groups : a rent-preserving alliance of incumbent producers and affiliated labor opposes competition policies that erode its market dominance; a pro-competition coalition of consumers, unorganized workers, and entrepreneurs favors regulatory oversight. Tests of the timing and nature of reform in democracies support the argument that commitments to antitrust regulatory reform are weakened where the anticompetitive interest group is large and encompassing. Chapter 4 develops hypotheses regarding the firm-level determinants of lobbying and political influence. I argue that economic power translates directly into political power : large, well-organized oligopolists are more likely to lobby and to influence government policy in their favor. I directly test lobbying activity and policy influence using firm-level survey data from over 20,000 firms operating in 41 countries. The results suggest that the political power of the firm increases with its size, market power, and participation in business associations. There is some evidence that the substantive impact of these microeconomic determinants of political influence depends on the level of democracy

Housing Dynamics over the Business Cycle
Over the U.S. business cycle, fluctuations in residential investment are well known to systematically lead GDP. These dynamics are documented here to be specific to the U.S. and Canada. In other developed economies residential investment is broadly coincident with GDP. Nonresidential investment has the opposite dynamics, being coincident with or lagging GDP. These observations are in sharp contrast with the properties of nearly all business cycle models with disaggregated investment. Including mortgages and interest rate dynamics aligns the theory more closely with U.S. observations. Longer time to build in housing construction makes residential investment coincident with output.

Essays in Entrepreneurship
This dissertation contains three essays in entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship is a key generator of economic growth. Entrepreneurial firms innovate, both on the product and process margins, creating new technologies and organizational novelties, bringing about positive spillovers to the economy as a whole. As such, understanding the factors underlying such activity is vital. This dissertation is concerned with who becomes an entrepreneur and why he or she does so, what factors influence the success of an entrepreneurial venture, and what types of institutions best facilitate entrepreneurial activity. The first chapter resolves a longstanding empirical puzzle; that most entrepreneurs enter and persist in self-employment, despite lower initial earnings and earnings growth (Hamilton, 2000). I hypothesize that reported income is not a good measure for the returns to self-employment. The self-employed have the ability to underreport earnings (estimated to be between 18 and 57 percent (Slemrod, 2007)), and can compensate themselves in various ways that do not manifest as reported labor income. The estimation strategy employed to test this hypothesis relies on the presumption that reported consumption by the self-employed will not be systematically misreported, even though income can easily be. Using longitudinal data from the PSID, I find that while individuals report earning 27 percent less in self- employment they in fact consume 5 percent more. This implies a 32 percent differential between reported wage and consumption for the self-employed. Furthermore, this increased consumption does not seem to be offset by lower savings or higher uncertainty. Other results include that the self-employed work longer hours and that lifetime consumption is no lower for those who leave self- employment. The second chapter links the network structure amongst initial employees to the performance of a newly founded firm. We use a large employee-employer linked panel data set from Brazil that allows us to track workers across jobs and establish whether new firm employees have prior joint work experience. We use this information to construct a quantifier for network concentration using the Herfindahl Hirschman Index (HHI), and test the impact of network concentration on new firm performance as measured by survival, employment, and wages. We find that new firms with higher network concentrations, i.e. wherein initial employees have worked together previously, are on average larger, have higher wages and survive longer when controlling for industry fixed effects and employees' human capital, demographic characteristics, formal sector experience, and size of parent firms. This association increases with the initial size of the newly founded firm. However, we find a negative relationship between network concentration and initial firm growth. Finally, we look at how the size of an individual's parent firm affects the success of her new entrepreneurial venture and find that small firm experience correlates with better survival rates, but lower employment and average wages at the new firm. The third chapter examines the conditions under which an informal network may decide to formalize into an entrepreneurial organization. Such organizations are formal, not-for-profit entities whose main objective is to facilitate networking so as to generate partnerships leading to entrepreneurial ventures. In order to create fruitful business partnerships, both the informal network and the formal organizations seek to grow. The growth process in the informal network occurs via bilateral sponsorship which rigorously screens entrants and is therefore slow, while that for a formal organization is much faster but less certain to only admit high types. We formally model these two entities and set the stage for an analysis of the tradeoffs between them

The Euro and the global crises: finding the balance between short term stabilization and forward looking reforms
This paper analyzes reforms and adjustments in the context of the Euro and the global financialcrises. Taking the perspective of the evolutionary approach to institutions, the formation of a newcurrency area is not unidirectional. The process leading to the euro is an example of a commonupbeat and optimistic attitude to the formation of new institutions. Such a Panglossian attitude topolicies may reflect built-in fiscal myopia, possibly both at the level of the principal the policymaker and of the agents consumers and households. Next, the paper reviews the evolution ofinstitutions buffering the stability of unions in the aftermath of crises, where fiscal restraints andthe allocation of significant bargaining clout to the Federal Center increase the stability of aunion. The paper concludes with an overview of the challenges associated with finding theproper balance between financial integration and financial regulations

Financial Sector Ups and Downs and the Real Sector: Up by the Stairs and Down by the Parachute
This paper examines how financial expansion and contraction cycles affect the broader economy throughtheir impact on eight real economic sectors in a panel of 28 countries over 1960-2005, paying particularattention to large, or sharp, contractions and magnifying and mitigating factors. We find that abruptfinancial contractions are more likely to follow periods of accelerated growth, indicative of ‘up by thestairs, down by the parachute’ dynamics. Sharp fluctuations in the financial sector have asymmetriceffects, with the majority of real sectors adversely affected by contractions but not helped by expansions.The adverse effects of financial contractions are transmitted almost exclusively by the financial opennesschannel with foreign reserves mitigating these effects with a sizeable (10 to 15 times greater) impactduring sharp financial contractions. Both effects are magnified during particularly large financialcontractions (with coefficients on interaction terms two to three times greater than when all contractionsare considered). Consequent upon a financial contraction, the most severe real sector contractions occur incountries with high financial openness; relative predominance of construction, manufacturing, andwholesale and retail sectors; and low international reserves.

Surfing the Waves of Globalization: Asia and Financial Globalization in the Context of the Trilemma
Using the “trilemma indexes” developed by Aizenman et al. (2010) that measure the extent ofachievement in each of the three policy goals in the trilemma—monetary independence, exchange ratestability, and financial openness—we examine how policy configurations affect macroeconomicperformances, with focus on the Asian economies. We find that the three policy choices matter for outputvolatility and the medium-term level of inflation. Greater monetary independence is associated with loweroutput volatility while greater exchange rate stability implies greater output volatility, which can bemitigated if a country holds international reserves (IR) at a level higher than a threshold (about 20% ofGDP). Greater monetary autonomy is associated with a higher level of inflation while greater exchangerate stability and greater financial openness could lower the inflation rate. We find that trilemma policyconfigurations affect output volatility through the investment or trade channel depending on the opennessof the economies. Our results indicate that policy makers in a more open economy would prefer pursuinggreater exchange rate stability while holding a massive amount of IR. Asian emerging market economiesare found to be equipped with macroeconomic policy configurations that help the economies to dampenthe volatility of the real exchange rate. These economies’ sizeable amount of IR holding appears toenhance the stabilizing effect of the trilemma policy choices, and this may help explain the recentphenomenal buildup of IR in the region.

Optimal taxation in life cycle models
Whether to tax capital is a central question in both macroeconomics and public finance. Previous research demonstrates that in a life cycle model the optimal tax on capital is typically non-zero for a variety of reasons. My research analytically and quantitatively measures the strength of the different motives for a non-zero tax on capital in a life cycle model. The first chapter considers the impact on the optimal tax policy of including human capital accumulation endogenously. The second chapter measures the relative strength of each motive generally understood to produce a large optimal tax on capital in a standard life cycle model with exogenous age-specific human capital accumulation. The first two chapters demonstrate that the level of the Frisch labor supply elasticity, as well as the profile over the lifetime, have a dramatic impact on the optimal tax policy. The third chapter uses a pseudo panel to estimate the Frisch labor supply elasticity

Selection of a Global Set of GMPEs for the GEM-PEER Global GMPEs Project
Ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) relate a ground-motion parameter (e.g. peak ground acceleration) to a set of explanatory variables describing the source, wave propagation path and site conditions. In the past five decades many hundreds of GMPEs for the prediction of PGA and linear elastic response spectral ordinates have been published. An accompanying paper discusses the pre-selection of GMPEs undertaken within the framework of the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) Global GMPEs project, coordinated by the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center (PEER). Here, we discuss the following step undertaken to reduce the long list of pre-selected models down to a more manageable number for global hazard assessments. The procedure followed, consisting of an examination of themulti-dimensional (e.g. magnitude, distance and structural period) predicted ground-motion space in various ways and published quantitative tests of the GMPEs against observational data not used for their derivation, is discussed and illustrated for subduction zones.

The Direct and Indirect Economic Effects of Transportation Infrastructure
The notion that highways boost economic activity is a popular one.  States such as Iowa and Wisconsin have promoted highway policy as an economic development tool (Dalton 1991; Forkenbrock and Plazah 1986).  Benefit-cost analyses of particular highway corridors have, at times, claimed large long-term economic gains (e.g. Seskin 1990; Weisbrod and Beckwith 1992). Yet for years, economists have argued that the common perception of a link between highways and economic development is, at best, incomplete.

The Transit-Oriented Global Centers for Competitiveness and Livability: State Strategies and Market Responses in Asia
Over the past two decades, the spatial development patterns of city-regions have increasingly been shaped by global-scale centripetal and centrifugal market forces. Complex managerial tasks and specialized producer services agglomerate in the central locations of global city-regions, whereas standardized assemble lines, wholesale inventories, and customer services stretch over the peripheral locations of global production networks. One explanation for postindustrial agglomeration is the need for face-to-face interactions and knowledge spillovers among the labor-intensive business sectors. On the other hand, the spatial concentrations of knowledge-based activities are also promoted by entrepreneurial city-states’ economic development strategies. Since the 1990s, rail transit investments and urban regeneration projects have played a pivotal role in shaping competitive and livable global centers to attract foreign direct investments and qualified international workers. Despite the growing importance of city and regional planning in the global marketplace, existing studies have provided little evidence on transit-oriented urban regeneration projects particularly in global city-regions.
      This dissertation examines Hong Kong, Singapore, and Tokyo as three transit-oriented global center models, wherein entrepreneurial city-states have largely integrated rail transit investments with urban regeneration projects to guide postindustrial agglomeration and spur economic development in target locations. For each of the three Asian cases, I classify types of joint development packages on the basis of built environment attributes and estimate the impacts of rail transit investments and joint development packages on market location shifts and land price changes over the last decade. The empirical findings suggest that mixed-use redevelopment projects and urban amenity improvements around terminal stations largely shift the competitive advantages of knowledge-based businesses and the lifestyle preferences of highly skilled professionals towards central locations. The hedonic price models, however, reveal that the synergetic effects of rail transit investments and urban regeneration projects are highly redistributive over the rail transit networks as well as within each station catchment area, especially where urban districts are already well-developed and development regulations are generously relaxed for commercial profits.
      One might argue that the Asian models represent a few extreme cases in terms of transit investment levels and urban agglomeration patterns, having very different evolutional pathways and institutional structures from other global city-regions. In response to this argument, I also attempt to illustrate specific experiences and common themes across the three Asian models and selected global city-regions that have been moving towards transit-oriented urban regeneration. The international statistics and case reviews in this dissertation suggest that there is global momentum to put greater public-private resources together into large-scale rail transit investments and transit-oriented development projects. These entrepreneurial forces tend to generate significant agglomeration impacts on knowledge-based business activities in the global marketplace, while raising transit overcapitalization and social stratification problems in the local context. The cross-cutting lessons drawn from the three Asian cases and global comparisons stress the importance of (i) evaluating urban agglomeration benefits, (ii) choosing adequate transit technologies, (iii) establishing public private partnerships, (iv) applying value capture techniques and (v) ensuring local community interests in shaping “competitive” and “livable” transit oriented global centers.

The U.S. Housing Market and the Business Cycle --Theoretical and Empirical Investigations
This dissertation is composed of three essays on theoretical and empirical investigations into the U.S. housing market. Chapter 1 is to extend a two-sector dynamic general equilibrium model from Ravn, Grohe, and Uribe (2006) deep-habit framework to study asset pricing, particularly housing price. It allows interaction between nondurable and housing markets on both the supply-side and the demand-side. Due to the interaction between the two sectors, the parameter change in the single sector can affect markups of both goods at the steady-state. The findings indicate that the interaction between these two sectors reflects important cross-sector roles of these influential factors in explaining markups. Chapter 2 is to investigate the seeds of the recent housing and economic crisis by investigating the interrelationship between the recent bust in the housing market, economic recession, and related monetary policies undertaken by the Federal Reserve. A bi-factor dynamic factor model is developed to represent the housing market and the business cycles, and they are allowed to follow different two-state Markov-switching processes. They are linked through monetary policy as reflected in interest rates movements. We find a strong correlation between the business cycle and interest rates, and between the housing cycle and interest rates, and between the two cycles. However, the close relationship changes since the 2001 recession as interest rates end its low-level due to the uncertainty and the slow recovery after this recession. The missed linkage between the business cycle and the housing cycle worked as a seed of the housing market bust and the economic recession in 2007-2009.Chapter 3 aims to investigate the effect of a potential important driver of the recent housing price boom and bust - people's expectations on the U.S. housing asset returns. Particularly, it extends the volatility feedback model proposed in Kim, Morley and Nelson (KMN 2004) to study the relationship between housing volatility and returns during 1963-2007. The analysis considers two alternative breakpoints--1984Q1 and 1999Q1-- to distinguish permanent structural breakpoints from Markov-switching. The results indicate that the relationship between the U.S. housing volatility and the expected returns is significantly positive. Thus, the important role of people's expectation is strongly supported. The current U.S. housing bubble can be explained by the relationship between housing volatility and realized returns, and that between housing volatility and expected returns. Corresponding to Chapter 2, this chapter also indicates a strong association between housing cycles and business cycles, and a remarkable uncertainty in the U.S. housing market during the post-1999.

Essays on liquidity of U.S. common stocks
In Chapter 1, I find that stock characteristics do predict a stock's time-varying liquidity beta, i.e. its sensitivity to market, with the effect varying according to the assumed holding period using data on 30 small, medium, and large cap stocks between 1997 and 2002. I also find that liquidity is a priced factor for stock return even after controlling for market and stock measures of risk such as estimates of market volatility and stock level volatility. In order to mitigate problems arising from a small panel, I also test the returns model with ARCH errors on a larger sample of 2000 stocks. Chapter 2 accounts for endogenous liquidity in a standard asset pricing model. Loss of liquidity, especially during times of crises, needs to be incorporated into models of financial assets so as to forecast returns correctly. To identify the effect of endogenous stock liquidity on stock returns, an instrument is constructed from the NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ's decimalization program, which shrunk tick sizes from one-sixteenth of a dollar to one-hundredth of a dollar. Decimalization led to an increase in liquidity by allowing for narrower bid-ask spreads. Using daily price and quote data on U.S. common stocks, I find that as stocks becomes more illiquid, their future expected returns increase. In Chapter 3, I propose two related measures for algorithmic trading constructed from the Disclosure of Order Execution Statistics data in order to study the effect of algorithmic trading on stock liquidity. The first is the average time taken to fill an order once it arrives in the market, known as fill time, and the second is the proportion of orders executed within ten seconds of order arrival at the NYSE. Since the decision to use algorithms in trading is an endogenous one, I use the NYSE's introduction of autoquotes in 2003 to identify the causal effect of algorithmic trading on a stock's liquidity. Using IV estimation, I find that a one second decrease in fill time narrows spreads by two basis points

Mortgage default and student outcomes, the solar home price premium, and the magnitude of housing price declines
This dissertation presents three studies related to housing. The first quantifies the effect of mortgage default on elementary student's academic outcomes. We first document socioeconomic differences between students experiencing default and those that did not in San Diego Unified School District in the aftermath of the housing market crash that began in 2006. We identify the impact of default using student-level fixed effects to compare the same student before and after default. Students experiencing default have lower math scores and greater absenteeism in the year of the default. We also find that classroom and neighborhood mortgage default rates are negatively related to education outcomes. The second study uses a large sample of homes in the San Diego and Sacramento, California areas to provide some of the first capitalization estimates of the sales value of homes with solar panels relative to comparable homes without solar panels. Using both hedonics and a repeat sales index approach we find that solar panels are capitalized at roughly a 3.5% premium. This premium is larger in communities with a greater share of college graduates and of registered Prius hybrid vehicles. The final study examines differences in the magnitude of recent housing price decreases across metropolitan areas. A relatively small number of housing market variables observable before the fall are capable of explaining over 70% of the considerable variation in price declines. An additional nonparametric analysis suggests that exceeding particular thresholds for some of the key predictors is associated with much larger price drops. These findings are consistent with historical price patterns, which raises questions about the validity of mortgage pricing policy and risk diversification norms in the US. The analysis points to a set of stylized facts concerning the housing price bubble that need to be explained and suggests fruitful hypotheses for understanding the dramatic housing price declines

"Keeping Up" or "Keeping Afloat"? : how American households accumulate wealth
Since Veblen's seminal work on "conspicuous consumption," a major academic tradition has connected household wealth loss to status-driven overspending. Using Consumer Expenditure Survey data from 2004-2009, this dissertation explores consumption patterns of American households to assess determinants of wealth loss. Of particular interest is the conformity of observed patterns with the expectations of status-spending theories and other theories of wealth loss and overspending. Findings from a series of logistic and OLS regression models indicate that disadvantaged circumstances (e.g. job loss, extreme medical costs, poverty) have considerably more explanatory power than status spending. I conclude that wealth loss is not primarily attributable to households' desire to overspend, in the contemporary American context

Trilemma Policy Convergence Patterns and Output Volatility
We examine the open macroeconomic policy choices of developing economies from the perspectiveof the economic “trilemma” hypothesis. We construct an index of divergence of the threetrilemma policy choices, and evaluate its patterns in recent decades. We find that the threedimensions of the trilemma configurations are converging towards a “middle ground” amongemerging market economies -- managed exchange rate flexibility underpinned by sizable holdingsof international reserves, intermediate levels of monetary independence, and controlled financialintegration. Emerging market economies with more converged policy choices tend to experiencesmaller output volatility in the last two decades. Emerging markets with relatively low internationalreserves/GDP could experience higher levels of output volatility when they choose a policycombination with a greater degree of policy divergence. Yet this heightened output volatility effectdoes not apply to economies with relatively high international reserves/GDP holding.

Global Inflation Dynamics: regularities & forecasts
The analysis of dollar inflation performed by the authors through the approximation of empirical data for 1913–2012 with a power-law function with an accelerating log-periodic oscillation superimposed over it has made it possible to detect a quasi-singularity point around the 17th of December, 2012. It is demonstrated that, if adequate measures are not taken, one may expect a surge of inflation around the end of this year that may also mark the start of stagflation as there are no sufficient grounds to expect the re-start of the dynamic growth of the world economy by that time. On the other hand, as the experience of the 1970s and the 1980s indicates, the stagflation consequences can only be eliminated with great difficulties and at a rather high cost, because the combination of low levels of economic growth and employment with high inflation leads to a sharp decline in consumption, aggravating the economic depression. In order to mitigate the inflationary consequences of the explosive growth of money (and, first of all, US dollar) supply it is necessary to take urgently the world monetary emission under control. This issue should become central at the forthcoming G8 and G20 summits.

In thispaper we overview and contrast the Trilemma policy choices and tradeoffs faced by thetwo key drivers of global economic growth-China and India. China’s Trilemmaconfigurations are unique relative to other emerging markets in the predominance ofexchange rate stability, and in the failure of the Trilemma regression to capture aconsistently significant role for financial integration. In contrast, the Trilemmaconfigurations of India are in line with choices made by other emerging countries. Indialike other emerging economies has overtime converged towards a middle ground betweenthe three policy objectives, and has achieved comparable levels of exchange rate stabilityand financial integration buffered by sizeable international reserves

Statistical Approach to Stock Market Overreaction and Seasonality
In their study "Does the Stock Market Overreact?", Debondt and Thaler proposed the overreaction hypothesis, which states that if a stock experiences significant price movement, then a subsequent price movement in the opposite direction is likely to follow. Moreover, the level of extremeness is positively correlated between the initial and the following price movement. In this study we would adopt the similar algorithm, using the data of recent three decades to test the overreaction hypothesis. Besides, the study of overreaction has shed light to the research of "January Effect" in stock market. A linear regression model will be used to test the existence of "January Effect", by analyzing the stocks with greater lossesduring a 5-year period.

Managing Financial Integration and Capital Mobility— Policy lessons from the past two decades
The accumulated experience of emerging markets over the last two decades has laid bare thetenuous links between external financial integration and faster growth on the one hand and theproclivity of such integration to fuel costly crises on the other. These crises have not gonewithout learning. During the 1990s and 2000s, emerging markets converged to the middleground of the policy space defined by the macroeconomic trilemma, with growing financialintegration, controlled exchange rate flexibility and proactive monetary policy. The OECDcountries moved much faster towards financial integration, embracing financial liberalization,opting for a common currency in Europe, and for flexible exchange rates in other OECDcountries. Following their crises of 1997-2001, emerging markets added financial stability as agoal, self-insured by building up international reserves and adopted a public finance approach tofinancial integration. The global crisis of 2008-09, which originated in the financial sector ofadvanced economies, meant that the OECD “overshot” the optimal degree of financialderegulation while the remarkable resilience of the emerging markets validated their publicfinance approach to financial integration. The story is not over: with capital flowing in droves toemerging markets once again, history could repeat itself without dynamic measures to managecapital mobility as part of a comprehensive prudential regulation effort.

Income inequality, tax base and sovereign spreads
This note investigates the impact of greater income inequality on the tax base, on the defactofiscal space, and the sovereign spreads. Using data from 50 countries in 2005 and in 2010,we find that higher income inequality is associated with a lower tax base, lower de-facto fiscalspace, and higher sovereign spreads. The economic magnitude of these effects is rather large: aone standard deviation increase of inequality is associated with a lower tax base of 28 % GDP,and with a higher sovereign spread of 240 basis points in 2005

The Effects of Federal Transit Subsidy Policy on Investment Decisions: The Case of San Francisco's Geary Corridor
In the United States, federal funding for public transit often accounts for a large proportion of a local agency's budget, especially for capital investments. For this reason, local governments can be expected to plan a portfolio of projects that maximize federal contributions. This study examines the financial effects of federal transit subsidy policy on local transit investment decisions. Data from a System Planning Study for the Geary Corridor in San Francisco are used as an illustration. It is found that federal transit subsidy policy provides financial incentives for local decision-makers to select capital-intensive investment options that may not be efficient or effective. While federal financial incentives are not the only factor influencing local investment decisions, some reform of the current subsidy policy may be necessary to reduce the incentive for ineffective use of public resources.

Project Scheduling in the Financial Management of Supply Chains
This study models the supply chain related financial performance of a manufacturer evaluated by the accumulated cash at the end of a one-year period. The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive approach for modeling of financial supply chains and to show how some of the project scheduling techniques aiming to improve the Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC), e.g., Lead Time crashing or delaying the payments to the upstream supply chain partners, may effect the financial performance. We simulated a manufacturer adopting "make to stock" policy over a one-year period using Monte Carlo Simulation. While traditional approach promotes shorter CCC, our simulation results show that there is an optimal Cash Conversion Cycle below which harms the company profitability. So, by analyzing the results our study finds the optimal financial and operational policies for the company corresponding to the optimal CCC level.

Essays on predictability of emerging markets growth and financial performance
This dissertation seeks to better understand the underlying factors driving financial performance and economic activity in international markets. The first chapter "Predictability of Growth in Emerging Markets: Information in Financial Aggregates" tests for predictability of output growth in a panel of twenty-two emerging market economies. I use pooled panel data methods that control for endogeneity and persistence in the predictor variables to test the predictive power of a large set of financial aggregates including valuation measures, interest rates, and capital flows. I find empirical evidence that stock returns, portfolio investment flows, the term spread and default spreads help predict output growth in emerging markets. In particular, large capital inflows predict subsequent high GDP growth as do high term spreads. Conversely, higher default spreads on emerging market government debt signals lower future GDP growth. Results also suggest that the performance of global aggregates such as commodity markets, a cross-sectional firm size factor, and returns on the market portfolio contain information about the future state of the economy. I benchmark my results against the US and find that there are differences in information flows and the role of capital markets in predicting economic growth. My analysis extends previous findings in the macro-finance literature on the links between the real economy and financial market performance. Within emerging markets, a largely unexplored area of research is related to the study of mutual funds performance. In my second chapter, "Emerging Market Mutual Fund Performance and the State of the Economy" I propose a set of asset class specific predictive variables and exploit them in order to identify those funds that outperform the market in different phases of the economic cycle. I employ a comprehensive survivorship-bias free universe of global and regional emerging market funds and use a Bayesian framework that incorporates predictability in manager skills (stock selection and benchmark timing skills), fund risk loadings and benchmark returns by exploiting ex-ante business cycle related state variables. Results provide empirical evidence of return predictability and the economic value of active management in emerging markets. My final dissertation chapter studies market integration and segmentation and their effects on return predictability. In "Mutual Fund Return Predictability in Partially Segmented Markets" (co-authored with B. Gillen, A. Timmermann and R. Wermers) we generalize existing models for Bayesian asset selection by considering both integrated and partially segmented market models. We find that regional state variables can be used to identify a significant time-varying alpha component among a large sample of funds with a pan- European, European country, or European sector focus. Specifically, the default yield spread, term spread, dividend yield, short interest rate and market volatility, as well as macroeconomic variables tracking consumer price inflation and growth in industrial production prove valuable in identifying, ex-ante, funds with superior performance. Our analysis also suggests that allowing for segmentation in market risk factors enhances risk-adjusted performance

Understanding and managing corporate agency problems
This dissertation examines the relationships between agency problems and mechanisms that mitigate those problems. The first chapter examines both theoretically and empirically how the quality of firm information disclosure affects shareholders' use of dividend policies to mitigate agency problems. As a first step to induce the manager to behave in the interests of shareholders, managerial compensation is linked to the value of the firm. However, the manager and shareholders are asymmetrically informed. As a result, the manager can manipulate the firm's accounting information through earnings management to increase perceived firm value. This chapter shows how dividends can limit earnings management practices, by adding to the cost faced by a manager who inflates earnings. Dividend payers show less evidence of earnings management and show less evidence of a change in behavior after the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX), a law that increased financial disclosures. This suggests that dividends had indeed been useful in limiting earnings management. The second chapter analyzes how firms switch between monitoring tools. SOX and contemporaneous changes by NYSE and NASDAQ created minimum requirements on board composition. This chapter analyzes how treated and untreated firms changed other monitoring tools such as CEO ownership, CEO compensation, firm leverage, and dividend policy. The results suggest that independent board members are substitutes for monitoring that comes from CEO ownership and debt. Some evidence is also found that firms forced to create an independent audit committee increased leverage and decreased dividends. The third chapter examines bank dividend policy responses to SOX and the passage of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Act of 2003 (Tax Reform). Agency models predict that the monitoring from SOX induces firms to lower dividends and that a dividend tax rate decrease induces firms to adopt or increase dividends. I find no evidence of a change in dividend behavior in the banking sector after SOX or after the Tax Reform

Predicting delinquency in mortgage payments : the roles of race and mortgage terms
A probit model predicting delinquency in mortgage payments is estimated, using demographic, employment, wealth, and loan characteristics. Particular attention is paid to respondents reporting the main reason for choosing the particular lender and loan as being "Because I thought it was the only place we could get credit." This factor is one of the strongest predictors for having one of the types of loans described above. An investigation into who would be predicted to answer in that manner follows, with race identified as a powerful predictor for the first time in any of the models, with a white respondent 8 percentage points less likely to name credit constraint concerns as the main reason for choosing their mortgage

The Fiscal Stimulus of 2009-10: Trade Openness, Fiscal Space and Exchange Rate Adjustment
This paper studies the cross-country variation of the fiscal stimulus and the exchange rate adjustmentpropagated by the global crisis of 2008-9, identifying the role of economic structure in accounting for theheterogeneity of response. We find that greater de facto fiscal space prior to the global crisis and lowertrade openness were associated with a higher fiscal stimulus/GDP during 2009-2010 (where the de factofiscal space is the inverse of the average tax-years it would take to repay the public debt). Lowering the2006 public debt/average tax base from the level of low-income countries (5.94) down to the averagelevel of the Euro minus the Euro-area peripheral countries (1.97), was associated with a larger crisisstimulus in 2009-11 of 2.78 GDP percentage points. Joint estimation of fiscal stimuli and exchange ratedepreciations indicates that higher trade openness was associated with a smaller fiscal stimulus and ahigher depreciation rate during the crisis. Overall, the results are in line with the predictions of the neo-Keynesian open-economy model.

Economic Growth in Urban Regions: Implications for Future Transportation
A central tenet of urban economics is that households, businesses, and industries compete for urban sites that enjoy accessibility advantages – whether to jobs, labor markets, raw materials, or distributions centers. Transportation investments trigger economic growth by enhancing accessibility, particularly in fast-growing, congested cities. Scholarly work suggests the impacts are more redistributive than generative – that is, new highways, rail investments, and busways shift growth that would have happened regardless from particular corridors and subareas of a region to others as opposed to prompting firm relocations and new business investments in a region. Factors other than transportation, such as “quality of life”, are increasingly influencing location choices of middle-income households and firms that are footloose. Of course, transportation and quality of life are not unrelated – public opinion polls reveal that being stuck in traffic is often first on the list among factors that are blamed for a declining quality of urban living.

Essays on the U.S. Housing Market and the Credit Market
This dissertation includes three chapters. The first two chapters focus on the U.S. housing market and the credit market and the third chapter emphasizes interest rate cycles and stock market cycles in the U.S.Chapter 2 proposes a dynamic factor model to study the U.S. housing market and the credit market separately in the last decades. The model extracts the latent unobserved state representing each market from an array of key related variables. The extracted factor from each market is compared to business cycles and to changes in monetary policy as represented by fluctuations in interest rates. I find that, firstly, there are strong correlations between the housing market, the credit market and business cycles. Secondly, these two markets are connected to changes in interest rates.Chapter 3 connects the housing market and the credit market by extending Chapter 2. This chapter uses a dynamic two-factor model to study housing market and credit market fluctuations, and their interrelationships during the recent U.S. financial crisis. I investigate whether other variables play an important role in explaining the recent crisis. The two-factor model is estimated in a unified framework, taking into consideration the role of loosening and/or tightening of loan standards in the last decades. The results indicate strong correlations between the housing market, the credit market, business cycles, and interest rates. Moreover, loosening or tightening of loan standards has significant impacts on these two markets, especially in the last decade.Chapter 4 models interest rate cycles and their relationship with financial cycles. A nonlinear two-state Markov switching model is used to obtain different regimes in interest rate cycles and in stock market cycles. Turning points for each cycle is established and the analysis of their lead-lag relationships is examined. The results indicate that there are strong connections between interest rate cycles, stock market cycles and business cycles. In particular, I find that the stock market enters a bear market phase at around the same time that the interest rate enters a high phase which is signaling the possible beginning of an economic recession.

The Color of Money in Greater Boston: Patterns of Mortgage Lending and Residential Segregation at the Beginning of the New Century
The findings of this paper underline the need for “modernization” of Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which now applies only to banks and covers only lending in areas where the banks have branches. In the Boston NECTA during the 2000-2002 period, 70% of home-purchase lending was done by out-of-state banks or by mortgage companies not affiliated with Massachusetts banks. These lenders, not covered by CRA, perform significantly worse than covered lenders in lending to borrowers and neighborhoods of color. Pending Massachusetts legislation would bring the state’s CRA into line with the transformed nature of the mortgage lending industry by imposing CRA-type obligations and evaluations on all types of mortgage lenders. This could make a significant contribution to reducing the current racial/ethnic disparities in mortgage lending that are documented in this paper.

Fairness or Favoritism? Geographic Redistribution and Fiscal Equalization Resulting from Transportation Funding Formulas
Federal and state governments use funding formulas to apportion, or geographically distribute, billions of dollars of expenditures for transportation programs every year. Past studies suggest that successful targeting of such funding results in fairness towards all areas while lack of targeting results in favoritism towards some areas over others.
      By examining the two issues of geographic redistribution and fiscal equalization, this study assesses the fairness of three examples of transportation funding formulas. Descriptive and inferential statistical methods (including location quotients, indices of dissimilarity, and simple regressions) are used to measure the amount of funding that is geographically redistributed, and to measure how consistent the distributions of funds are with the principle of fiscal equalization.
      Analyses of the patterns of geographic redistribution show that federal transportation funds are redistributed from the most populous states to the least populous states, that California state highway funds are redistributed from the most densely populated counties to the least densely populated counties, and that California transit funds are not geographic redistributed.
      Numerous needs targeting studies have measured the need for funding in terms of fiscal capacity, or the ability of governments to raise revenues, and asked whether or not intergovernmental aid is apportioned in a manner which equalizes fiscal capacities. While the overall pattern of intergovernmental aid has been scrutinized, the distributive impact of transportation grants in particular has not been conclusively determined. This study finds that California highway funding apportionments result in fiscal equalization, while federal transportation funding and California transit apportionments do not act to equalize fiscal capacities.
      Based upon these empirical findings, the study concludes that the federal funding apportionments results in favoritism, because tax revenues are being redistributed from the less wealthy states to the more wealthy states. In contrast, the California state highway apportionments result in fairness, since tax revenues are being redistributed in a fiscally equalizing fashion from the more wealth counties to the less wealthy counties.

Using Performance Incentives to Improve Medical Care Productivity and Health Outcomes
We nested a large-scale field experiment into the national rollout of the introduction of performance pay for medical care providers in Rwanda to study the effect of incentives for health care providers. In order to identify the effect of incentives separately from higher compensation, we held constant compensation across treatment and comparison groups – a portion of the treatment group’s compensation was based on performance whereas the compensation of the comparison group was fixed. The incentives led to a 20% increase in productivity, and significant improvements in child health. We also find evidence of a strong complementarity between performance incentives and baseline provider skill.

Cognitive engagement in presidential politics : what Americans learn about presidents, vice presidents, and challengers
Many scholars and media pundits alike bemoan Americans' political ignorance. Facing stiff competition for their viewers from cable television in the 1980s, the broadcast news networks increased their coverage of softer news topics. Consequently, some claim that the public is less politically engaged today than they were in the days of when the network news focused on public affairs. Using cognitive measures of how Americans evaluate presidential candidates, I show that they are more engaged today than before the rise of cable television. The public has more reasons for supporting and opposing presidents when they run for reelection than they did four years before. They also learn more about a president's policies than his character. Perhaps more importantly, the public is learning as much about presidents and their policies in the cable era than in the years when broadcast news focused primarily on public affairs. The cable era is not creating a class of political dropouts. Politically uninterested Americans are more likely to abandon the network news when they get access to cable. They are actually learning more about presidents and their policies in the cable era than in the days when the average household had fewer television channels. Even though the public is more engaged about presidents today than in the past, they typically are not aware of vice presidents when it is their turn to run for president compared to incumbents and challengers. Consequently, Americans tend to evaluate VPs more in terms of their character than their policies, whereas incumbents are evaluated for their record. This evidence supports previous research that implies vice presidents do not get credit for the current administration's record

Failure to catalyze : why IMF- supported programs fail to promote investment
This dissertation examines the relationship between a country's involvement in an International Monetary Fund (IMF) facility and that country's ability to catalyze capital inflows. The IMF and policymakers tend to "take for granted" the catalytic effect of IMF lending (e.g. Schadler et al 1995; Bird and Rowlands 1997). However, with few exceptions, the empirical literature finds that Fund arrangements do not increase a participating country's access to private capital, and in fact more likely diminish the country's access to private capital. Why does there exist variation in the catalytic effect of Fund lending? This dissertation argues that the effect of IMF agreements on a country's access to private capital is dependent on whether or not investors believe the participatory country will implement the reforms tied to the IMF loan. International, facility, and domestic-level factors influence investor's expectations of implementation, thus influencing whether or not they will invest in the participatory country. The theory is empirically tested using a Treatment Effects Model with a Markov Transition in the treatment equation in a dataset covering 142 countries between 1977 and 2008. Countries which sign IMF agreements experience an increase in portfolio investment, regardless of international, domestic and facility-level factors. However, countries which sign IMF agreements experience different levels of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, depending on, 1) whether they are of geopolitical strategic importance to powerful members of the IMF, 2) if they have signed a concessional loan, 3) the level of executive autonomy. The results supported the theory that investors do not view all IMF program equally and respond positively to those types of programs where implementation is more likely

A Test of Inter-modal Performance Measures for Transit Investment Decisions
Choices among alternative transit capital investments are often complex and politically controversial. There is renewed interest in the use of performance indicators to assist in making rational and defensible choices for the investment of public funds. To improve the evaluation of rail and bus performance and provide more useful information for transit investment decision-makers, it is important to use performance indicators that fairly and efficiently compare different transit modes. This paper proposes a set of inter-modal performance indicators in which service input, service output, and service consumption are measured by total cost, revenue capacity miles/hours, and unlinked passenger trips/miles respectively based on economic principles and evaluation objectives. The proposed improvements involve the inclusion of capital as well as operating costs in such comparisons, and the recognition of the widely varying capacities of transit vehicles for seated and standing passengers. Two California cases, the Los Angeles – Long Beach Corridor and the Market/Judah Corridor in San Francisco, are used for testing their usefulness in the evaluation of the efficiency and effectiveness of rail and bus services. The results show substantial differences between performance indicators in current use and those proposed in this study. The enhanced inter-modal performance indicators are more appropriate for comparing the efficiency and effectiveness of different modes or a combination of transit modes at the corridor and system levels where most major investment decisions are made.

Reducing Trust When Trust Is Essential
Trust is unavoidable in many complex systems. As users demand more functionality and convenient access, there is often a point at which a systems designer has no choice but to ask clients to place some level of trust in one participant in the system, be it a key management server or even just the integrity of some external hardware. This is in contrast to many cryptographic functionalities that will either perform as expected, or at least remain secure, without a client having to trust anything but their own integrity. The main focus of this thesis is to conduct a thorough analysis of two settings in which trust is essential and find new dimensions in which to reduce the amount of trust the participants are asked to put in the system for it to function as expected. First, we analyze remote storage where a third party is trusted to store and do access control on a client's data. Second, we study what additional assumptions are necessary in order to circumvent impossibility of fully secure MPC without an honest majority.

Liquidity Constraints, Household Wealth, and Entrepreneurship Revisited
A large body research shows a positive relationship between wealth andentrepreneurship and interprets the relationship as providing evidence of liquidity constraints.Recently, however, the liquidity constraint interpretation has been challenged because of thefinding that the relationship between business entry rates and assets is flat throughout most of theasset distribution and only rises dramatically after this point (Hurst and Lusardi 2004). Wereexamine the liquidity constraint hypothesis in three ways. First, we demonstrate that examiningthe relationship separately for those who experience a job loss and those who do notreveals generally increasing entry rates through the wealth distribution for both groups. Basedon the entrepreneurial choice model of Evans and Jovanovic (1989), these two groups facedifferent incentives, and thus have different solutions to the entrepreneurial decision. We alsofind evidence of a stronger relationship between entrepreneurship and a different measure ofwealth – net housing equity – for the two groups. Second, we examine the liquidity constrainthypothesis using a two-period simulation model that extends the Evans and Jovanovic (1989)model. The model shows how exogenous wealth shocks can be used to accurately identify thepresence of liquidity constraints even allowing for endogenous saving and correlated abilities.Third, we provide new evidence from matched Current Population Survey (1993-2004) data tostudy whether changes in housing prices affect self-employment entry. We find thathousing appreciation measured at the MSA-level is a significantly positive determinant of entryinto self-employment after controlling for changes in local economic conditions and otherfactors. Our estimates indicate that a 10 percent annual increase in housing equity increases themean probability of entrepreneurship by 17 percent and that the effect is not concentrated at theupper tail of the distribution. These estimates are not sensitive to controlling for pre-existingtrends in housing prices suggesting that the results are not being driven by expected localeconomic growth.

Incorporating Non-energy Benefits into Energy Savings
Performance Contracts
This paper evaluates the issue of non-energy benefits within the context of the U.S. energy
services company (ESCO) industry?a growing industry comprised of companies that provide energy savings and other benefits to customers through the use of performance-based contracting. Recent analysis has found that ESCO projects in the public/institutional sector, especially at K-12 schools, are using performance-based contracting, at the behest of the customers, to partially -- but not fully -- offset substantial accumulated deferred maintenance needs (e.g., asbestos removal, wiring) and measures that have very long paybacks (roof replacement). This trend is affecting the traditional economic measures policymakers use to evaluate success on a benefit to cost basis. Moreover, the value of non-energy benefits which can offset some or all of the cost of the non-energy measures -- including operations and maintenance (O&M) savings, avoided capital costs, and tradable pollution emissions allowances-- are not always incorporated into a formal cost-effectiveness analysis of ESCO projects. Nonenergy
benefits are clearly important to customers, but state and federal laws that govern the
acceptance of these types of benefits for ESCO projects vary widely (i.e., 0-100percent of allowable savings can come from one or more non-energy categories). Clear and consistent guidance on what types of savings are recognized in Energy Savings agreements under performance contracts is necessary, particularly where customers are searching for deep energy efficiency gains in the building sector.

Transportation Infrastructure, Economic Productivity, and Geographic Scale: Aggregate Growth versus Spatial Redistribution
Recent  cross-state studies of public infrastructure suggest that infrastructure is not  economically  productive. Yet it is possible that public capital influences economic  activity  largely by shifting that activity from one location to another. If that is the case, infrastructure  can be productive at small geographic scales but not productive over large areas. This paper  tests that hypothesis with a production function study of highway  and road capital in  California counties for the years 1969 through 1988. The results show  that county output is  positively associated with highway  capital in the county, but negatively associated with  highway  capital in neighboring counties. This suggests that the productive effects of highway  capital are largely a shift in economic  activity from one county to another.

Robust Maintenance Policies for Markovian Systems under Model Uncertainty
Asset management systems help public works agencies decide when and how to maintain and rehabilitate infrastructure facilities in a cost effective manner. Many sources of error, some difficult to quantify, can limit the ability of asset management systems to accurately predict how built systems will deteriorate. This paper introduces the use of robust optimization to deal with epistemic uncertainty. The Hurwicz criterion is employed to ensure management policies are never ‘too conservative.’ An efficient solution algorithm is developed to solve robust counterparts of the asset management problem. A case study demonstrates how the consideration of uncertainty alters optimal management policies and shows how the proposed approach may reduce maintenance and rehabilitation (M&R) expenditures.

Essays on Foreign Direct Investment, Growth and the Environment
This dissertation is composed of three essays on the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on productivity growth, convergence, and the environment. Chapter 2 decomposes labor productivitygrowth into components attributable to technological change, technological catch-up, foreign capital deepening, domestic capital deepening, and human capital accumulation, thus separating the effects of foreign and domestic capital deepening on productivity growth and convergence. We apply nonparametric production-frontier methods to a worldwide 1980--2005 panel and find that (1) foreign capital accumulation, together with human capital accumulation, is the driving force for productivity growth and increasing international dispersion of productivity, (2) technological change is decidedly non-neutral, with most technologicaladvancement taking place in foreign-capital-intensive countries, and (3) international polarization is brought about primarily by efficiency changes.Chapter 3 develops a statistical procedure to select the appropriatenonparametric efficiency model in terms of its dimensionality. The change of dimensionality is categorized into three cases: nested variable changes (expansion or contraction of a variable set), additive variable changes (aggregation or disaggregation of a variable set) and other non-nested model changes. A bootstrapping method is proposed to measure the size of the dimensionalityeffect. Potential bias in raw efficiency scores owing to the dimensionality effect is corrected to reflect true efficient levels. An empirical illustration is presented with the Hughes and Yaisawarng (2004) (hereafter HY) data set.Using U.S. state-level panel data from 1980--1994, chapter 4 estimates the impact of environmental stringency on the inflows of FDI in the U.S. The stringency of environmental policy is an uncontrollable variable in the operating environment. A  three-stage model is proposed to evaluate state performance with environmental variables and reassess the pollution haven hypothesis. The three-stage model combines both data envelopment analysis (DEA) and stochastic frontier analysis (SFA), and can isolate the impact of luck (statistical noise) from those of managerial efficiency and environmental effect. This paper improves the second stageSFA evaluation by using the Local Linear Least Squares (LLLS) estimator. The empirical result suggests a negative relationship between state-level environment standards and the distribution of foreign capital in the U.S.

When Finance Leads Planning: The Influence of Public Finance on Transportation Planning and Policy in California
This dissertation examines the role that finance plays in shaping transportation planning and policy making and concludes that the key to understanding the development of metropolitan transportation systems is found in the political negotiation and compromises made to secure public investment in those systems. The particular circumstances leading to or preventing a tax increase of appropriation for a program or project explains most of the success or failure of that program or project. Three cases from California are examined: (1) the planning and finance of urban freeways prior to 1960, (2) the shift from "freeway-first" to "multi-modal" urban transportation policies after 1960, and (3) the development of state subsidies of public transit after 1970. Each of these cases is a significant chapter in the transportation history of California and each will show that the goals of the rational planning model have largely gone unfulfilled; in each case, the politics of finance superseded planning at the local level and policy making at the state level.
