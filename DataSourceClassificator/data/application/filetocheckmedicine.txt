Depression, anxiety, and cognitive deficits in Parkinson’s Disease MSc Dissertation.
Depression has been suggested to be a frequently co-occurring symptom in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and research evidence has associated the disorder with impaired performance on a number of cognitive tests, especially those indicating frontal lobe cognitive dysfunction. The current study explored the relationship between depression and anxiety in Parkinson’s disease and frontal lobe cognitive impairment. Twenty community-based participants with PD were compared with 20 participants, over the age of 60 years, without a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease, matched for age, sex, educational level, and pre-morbid intelligence. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to measure mood, and the FAS Verbal Fluency test, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and a Stroop test were employed to measure frontal lobe cognitive functioning.  The group with Parkinson’s disease was characterised by greater anxiety and depression, in addition to impaired Verbal Fluency performance, compared with the group without the disorder. Participants with PD and major depression as defined by the HADS exhibited greater general cognitive impairment as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Younger participants and those in whom the disease had been diagnosed at a younger age were more likely to suffer from anxiety. A number of participants with Parkinson’s disease exhibited co-morbid anxiety and depression. In addition, four of the research sample with Parkinson’s disease scored below the cut-off point on the MMSE indicative of cognitive impairment sufficient to suggest dementia. Implications for those living with Parkinson’s disease plus recommendations for future research are discussed.

[erlotinib, pertuzumab, combination, patient, therapy, week, lung, cancer, her1, study]

A Phase Ib, Dose-Finding Study of Erlotinib in Combination With a Fixed Dose of Pertuzumab in Patients With Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.
BACKGROUND: Pertuzumab, a dimerization inhibitor of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), has demonstrated pharmacodynamic activity, with stable disease in non-small-cell lung cancer. Combining erlotinib and pertuzumab may enhance antitumor activity. This study aimed to establish the recommended dosing of the erlotinib and pertuzumab combination; assess safety, preliminary efficacy, and pharmacokinetics; and analyze biomarkers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with stage IIIb/IV non-small-cell lung cancer who failed chemotherapy were recruited. The patients received erlotinib (days -8 to -1), then combination therapy (21-day cycles for 6 cycles). Pertuzumab was given intravenous at 840 mg, then 420 mg once every three weeks, with erlotinib given daily (100 or 150 mg). RESULTS: No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Adverse events were generally grade 1/2 and manageable. The objective response rate was 20% (3/15 patients; 2 responders had mutant HER1, 1 responder had wild-type HER1), median overall progression-free survival was 9.3 weeks. High HER1, HER2, and HER3 messenger RNA expression correlated with increased progression-free survival. Combination therapy did not affect erlotinib's pharmacokinetics; however, pertuzumab mean exposures (maximum concentration, 231 mg/L; area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 21 days, 1780 mg*d/L) were slightly higher than in previous studies. CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy was well tolerated in patients with good performance status, with encouraging efficacy. A loading dose of pertuzumab 840 mg followed by 420 mg once every three weeks plus daily erlotinib 150 mg appears to be the most appropriate regimen for this combination.

[vandetanib, vc, gc, patient]

A phase I study of Vandetanib in combination with vinorelbine/cisplatin or gemcitabine/cisplatin as first-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
INTRODUCTION: Vandetanib is a once-daily oral agent that selectively inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, and RET (REarranged during Transfection) signaling. METHODS: This Phase I study investigated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of vandetanib when administered with either gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) or vinorelbine plus cisplatin (VC) in patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. RESULTS: Seventeen patients received vandetanib 100 mg/d plus VC (n = 9) or GC (n = 8). Three dose-limiting toxicities were reported in each treatment group: vandetanib + VC (pulmonary artery thrombosis and asymptomatic QTc prolongation n = 2); vandetanib + GC (peripheral ischemia due to arterial occlusion, pulmonary embolism, and limb venous thrombosis). The protocol definition of a tolerable dose was not met, and no patients were recruited to receive vandetanib 300 mg plus VC or GC. There was no apparent pharmacokinetic interaction between vandetanib and vinorelbine or gemcitabine, but there was an approximate 30% increase in the exposure to cisplatin, which may be due to accumulation of total platinum and/or an interaction with vandetanib. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, in patients with previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer, vandetanib 100 mg/d in combination with either VC or GC was not tolerated.

[bowel, irritable, syndrome, ondansetron]

Selective 5-hydroxytryptamine antagonism: a role in irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia?
BACKGROUND: Abnormalities of gut motility and visceral pain perception are both thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome and may be susceptible to modulation by drugs affecting the various 5-HT receptor subtypes. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic potential of a 5-HT3 antagonist in irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: Fifty patients with irritable bowel syndrome were treated with ondansetron, a highly selective 5-HT3 antagonist, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study. In addition to assessing its effect on the classical symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (abdominal pain, distension and disordered bowel habit) its effect on symptoms often seen in irritable bowel syndrome, but more commonly associated with functional dyspepsia, was also examined. RESULTS: Ondansetron reduced bowel frequency (P = 0.035) and improved stool consistency (P = 0.002) in diarrhoea predominant irritable bowel syndrome and did not cause a deterioration of bowel habit in constipation predominant subjects. No statistically significant improvement was seen for abdominal pain or distension, although those patients who did respond were approximately twice as likely to be taking ondansetron than placebo. It was also found that ondansetron significantly improved the upper gastrointestinal symptoms of post-prandial epigastric discomfort (P = 0.008), flatulence (P = 0.022) and heartburn (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The results of this study justify evaluation of the therapeutic potential of selective 5-HT antagonists in both functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome.

[doctor, practice, hour, drug, patient]

Comparison of out of hours care provided by patients' own general practitioners and commercial deputising services: a randomised controlled trial. I: The process of care.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the process of out of hours care provided by general practitioners from patients' own practices and by commercial deputising services. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Four urban areas in Manchester, Salford, Stockport, and Leicester. SUBJECTS: 2152 patients who requested out of hours care, and 49 practice doctors and 183 deputising doctors (61% local principals) who responded to those requests. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Response to call, time to visit, prescribing, and hospital admissions. RESULTS: 1046 calls were dealt with by practice doctors and 1106 by deputising doctors. Practice doctors were more likely to give telephone advice (20.2% v 0.72% of calls) and to visit more quickly than deputising doctors (median delay 35 minutes v 52 minutes). Practice doctors were less likely than deputising doctors to issue a prescription (56.1% v 63.2% of patients) or to prescribe an antibiotic (43.7% v 61.3% of prescriptions issued) and more likely to prescribe genetic drugs (58.4% v 32.1% of drugs prescribed), cheaper drugs (mean cost per prescription pounds 3.28 v pounds 5.04), and drugs in a predefined out of hours formulary (49.8% v 41.1% of drugs prescribed). There was no significant difference in the number of hospital admissions. CONCLUSIONS: By contrast with practice doctors, deputising doctors providing out of hours care less readily give telephone advice, take longer to visit at home, and have patterns of prescribing that may be less discriminating.

Amiodarone overdose and its management.
A patient taking an overdose of 3.4 g of amiodarone is described. Consciousness and physical examination remained normal throughout. Continuous electrocardiographic monitoring for 48 hours after admission revealed only a self-limiting episode of ventricular tachycardia, despite high serum levels of the drug (serum desethylamiodarone levels 4.4 mg/l). The pharmacokinetic properties of amiodarone and treatment strategies for the overdose situation are discussed. It is suggested that there may be a role for the use of cholestyramine in the treatment of both acute and chronic amiodarone toxicity.

[readmission, discharge, mortality, admission, elderly, day, pneumonia, community-acquired, difference, length]

Outcomes in elderly Danish citizens admitted with community-acquired pneumonia. Regional differencties, in a public healthcare system.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate regional differences in and risk factors for admission, length of stay, mortality, and readmission for community-acquired pneumonia in elderly Danish patients. METHODS: National registry study on elderly Danish citizens with an acute admission in 2009 owing to community-acquired pneumonia. We studied differences among hospitals in length of stay, in-hospital mortality, mortality within 30 days of discharge, and readmission within 30 days after discharge using Cox regression models with adjustments for age, sex, ventilatory support, and co-morbidity by Charlson's index score. RESULTS: A total of 11,332 elderly citizens were admitted with community-acquired pneumonia. Mortality during admission and 30-days from discharge were 11.6% and 16.2%, respectively. Readmission rates within 30 days of discharge were 12.3%. There were significantly differences between hospitals in length of stay. A high Charlson index score and advanced age were significantly risk factors for death during admission and within 30 days of discharge. Male sex and high Charlson index score were significant risk factors for readmission. Admission to large bed capacity hospital was a significant risk factor for death and readmission within 30 days of discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Length of stay, rate of admission, mortality and readmission in elderly Danish patients with community-acquired pneumonia follows international findings. There are regional differences between hospitals. In depth investigation in regional differences could reveal potential feasible clinical interventions with an improvement of readmission-, mortality rates and cost.

[e-stim, dysphagia]

Electrical stimulation and swallowing: how much do we know?
Consequences of dysphagia substantially reduce quality of life, increase the risk of medical complications and mortality, and pose a substantial cost to healthcare systems. As a result, it is of no wonder that the clinical and scientific communities are showing interest in new avenues for dysphagia rehabilitation. Electrical stimulation (e-stim) for the treatment of swallowing impairments is among the most studied swallowing interventions in the published literature, yet many unanswered questions about its efficacy remain. In the meantime, many speech-language pathologists who treat dysphagia are attending educational and training sessions to obtain certifications to use this technique. Here, we review the values and limitations of the published literature on the topic of e-stim for swallowing to assist clinicians in decision making in their clinical practice. The discussion provides a review of swallowing anatomy and physiology, the fundamentals of e-stim, and information essential for the readers' independent critique of these studies--all of which are crucial for evaluating the possible effects of e-stim.

[depression, rating, montgomery-asberg, nurse, patient, scale, predictive, stroke, value, study]

Can nurses help identify patients with depression following stroke? A pilot study using two methods of detection.
AIM: This paper reports a study to determine the accuracy of the Geriatric Mental State examination and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, when administered by a nurse, in detecting depression in patients who have recently had a stroke. BACKGROUND: After a stroke, survivors spend considerable amounts of time in the direct care of nurses. Many show signs of depression, and this has been associated with an adverse effect on recovery and rehabilitation. Identifying those with depression when they have communication and cognitive difficulties is especially difficult. Treatments are available to assist in the management of depression, and early detection and intervention may assist in this process. METHOD: A cross-sectional pilot study was conducted, comparing (a) clinical diagnosis of depression by a psychiatrist with (b) two clinical interviews, using the Geriatric Mental State examination and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, conducted by a nurse. The data were collected in 2002. FINDINGS: Twenty-eight patients, who were still in hospital in the second week poststroke, were included. The median age was 72 (interquartile range: 61-78). There were 14 males. The psychiatrist rated seven (25%) patients as depressed. The Geriatric Mental State examination had a sensitivity of 71%, a specificity of 67%, a positive predictive value of 42%, a negative predictive value of 88% in detecting depression and an overall efficiency of 68%. The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale had a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 65%, a positive predictive value of 54%, a negative predictive value of 100% and an overall efficiency of 75%. CONCLUSION: In this study, the Geriatric Mental State examination and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale were at least as efficient at detecting the depression in patients who have had a stroke. However, as the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale is quicker to administer, it may prove more useful to nurses clinically.

[infection, mouse, rsv, lung, virus, vaccination]

Influenza virus lung infection protects from respiratory syncytial virus-induced immunopathology.
The effect of infection history is ignored in most animal models of infectious disease. The attachment protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) induces T helper cell type 2-driven pulmonary eosinophilia in mice similar to that seen in the failed infant vaccinations in the 1960s. We show that previous influenza virus infection of mice: (a) protects against weight loss, illness, and lung eosinophilia; (b) attenuates recruitment of inflammatory cells; and (c) reduces cytokine secretion caused by RSV attachment protein without affecting RSV clearance. This protective effect can be transferred via influenza-immune splenocytes to naive mice and is long lived. Previous immunity to lung infection clearly plays an important and underestimated role in subsequent vaccination and infection. The data have important implications for the timing of vaccinations in certain patient groups, and may contribute to variability in disease susceptibility observed in humans.

[bowel, syndrome, irritable, woman, gynaecological]

Gynaecological consultation in patients with the irritable bowel syndrome.
A 12 month follow up study to assess the impact of symptoms suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome in women presenting to gynaecology clinics with pelvic pain is reported. Of 71 women 37 (52%) had symptoms suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome at presentation. A firm gynaecological diagnosis was reached in only three (8%) women positive for irritable bowel syndrome compared with 15 (44%) without (p = 0.002). After 12 months 24 (65%) women with irritable bowel syndrome were still symptomatic compared with 11 (32%) without (p = 0.01). This study shows that women with irritable bowel syndrome frequently attend gynaecological clinics but rarely have gynaecological pathology and the prognosis is poor in terms of resolution of their pain.

[cause, patient, theme, participant]

The purpose of attributing cause: beliefs about the causes of myocardial infarction.
Patients' beliefs concerning the causes of their illnesses are core to a number of theoretical models of illness behaviour. The current study explored the themes that emerged from patients' accounts of the causes of their first myocardial infarctions (MIs). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 patients within a week of their MI, at a UK district hospital. Transcripts were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Three researchers noted themes that emerged from each interview, then common themes were selected and refined on the basis of an aggregation of interviews. Three dominant themes emerged: (1) single versus multiple causation, (2) causes as triggers versus underlying dispositions, and (3) the potentially conflicting motives of avoiding blame whilst at the same time, seeking control. Whilst many participants had complex ideas concerning what caused their MI, and could often name several causes, they tended to emphasise the importance of a single cause, which often related to their symptoms. Further, several participants interpreted "cause" in terms of an acute trigger of MI, rather than as a chronic causal factor. Participants were apparently attempting to answer the question about why they had an MI now, leading to talk about single causes that trigger MI. By contrast, much previous research has been concerned with patients' knowledge of "risk factors", considering the production of only a few causes to reflect ignorance. A key process in participants attributing cause appeared to be attempting to avoid blaming themselves or others for their MI, whilst simultaneously seeking to assert control over future recurrence. Analysis of the functions and purposes of causal attribution suggests that patients' focus on blame and control may be both emotionally and behaviourally adaptive, if not necessarily epidemiologically precise. These findings suggest that interventions to change causal attributions may be misguided, and may even be harmful.

[clozapine, drug, antipsychotic, sga, schizophrenia, advantage]

Randomized controlled trial of effect of prescription of clozapine versus other second-generation antipsychotic drugs in resistant schizophrenia
There is good evidence that clozapine is more efficacious than first-generation antipsychotic drugs in resistant schizophrenia. It is less clear if clozapine is more effective than the other second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) drugs. A noncommercially funded, pragmatic, open, multisite, randomized controlled trial was conducted in the United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS). Participantswere 136 people aged 18–65 with DSM-IV schizophrenia and related disorders whose medication was being changed because of poor clinical response to 2 or more previous antipsychotic drugs. Participants were randomly allocated to clozapine or to one of the class of other SGA drugs (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, amisulpride) as selected by the managing clinician. Outcomes were assessed blind to treatment allocation. One-year assessments were carried out in 87% of the sample. The intent to treat comparison showed no statistically significant advantage for commencing clozapine in Quality of Life score (3.63 points; CI: 0.46–7.71; p = .08) but did show an advantage in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score that was statistically significant (–4.93 points; CI: -8.82 to -1.05; p = .013) during follow-up. Clozapine showed a trend toward having fewer total extrapyramidal side effects. At 12 weeks participants who were receiving clozapine reported that their mental health was significantlybetter compared with those receiving other SGA drugs. In conclusion, in people with schizophrenia with poor treatment response to 2 or more antipsychotic drugs,there is an advantage to commencing clozapine rather than other SGA drugs in terms of symptom improvement over 1 year.

[pain, crp, participant, knee, obesity]

Obesity is a risk factor for musculoskeletal pain in adolescents: Findings from a population-based cohort.
Obesity is a risk factor for fibromyalgia in adults, but whether a similar relationship exists in children is uncertain. This study examined whether obesity is associated with reporting of musculoskeletal pain, including chronic regional pain (CRP) and chronic widespread pain (CWP), in adolescents, in a population-based setting. A pain questionnaire was administered to offspring of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children at age 17, asking about site, duration, and pain intensity, from which participants with different types of musculoskeletal pain were identified. Relationships between obesity and pain were examined by calculating odds ratios stratified by gender and adjusted for socioeconomic status as reflected by level of maternal education. A total of 3376 participants (1424 boys) with complete data were identified, mean age 17.8; 44.7% of participants reported any pain within the last month lasting 1day or longer; 16.3% reported lower back pain, 9.6% shoulder pain, 9.4% upper back pain, 8.9% neck pain, 8.7% knee pain, 6.8% ankle/foot pain, 4.7% CRP, and 4.3% CWP; 7.0% of participants were obese. Obesity was associated with increased odds of any pain (odds ratio OR 1.33, P=.04), CRP (OR 2.04, P=.005), and knee pain (OR 1.87, P=.001), but not CWP (OR 1.10, P=.5). Compared with non obese participants, those with any pain, knee pain, and CRP reported more severe average pain (P<.01). Obese adolescents were more likely to report musculoskeletal pain, including knee pain and CRP. Moreover, obese adolescents with knee pain and CRP had relatively high pain scores, suggesting a more severe phenotype with worse prognosis.

[posaconazole, drug, therapeutic, monitoring, invasive]

Posaconazole: the case for therapeutic drug monitoring.
Invasive fungal infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Antifungal therapeutic options remain relatively limited; therefore, optimization of present regimens is essential. Posaconazole is licensed for prevention of invasive fungal infections and oropharyngeal candidiasis and salvage therapy for invasive aspergillosis. Recent data suggest that therapeutic drug monitoring may be an important tool for patient management. Clinical and laboratory animal data suggest that posaconazole demonstrates clinically relevant exposure-response relationships. Higher systemic drug exposure is associated with improved clinical outcomes. Potentially subtherapeutic concentrations are frequently encountered in critically ill patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring provides a way to optimize the use of posaconazole, and this review summarizes the indications and process by which this can be achieved.

[sumatriptan, chest, oesophageal]

Is chest pain after sumatriptan oesophageal in origin?
3-5% of patients taking the 5HT1D agonist sumatriptan for migraine have chest discomfort, suggesting a cardiac origin. We have investigated an alternative explanation of an oesophageal cause in 24 volunteers after the subcutaneous administration of a supratherapeutic dose of sumatriptan (16 mg) or placebo in a randomised, double-blind crossover study. Sumatriptan did not alter the electrocardiogram but increased the amplitude (p < 0.001) and duration (p < 0.001) of oesophageal contractions without affecting velocity of propagation. Clinically abnormal motility was also increased (p = 0.001), and was more common in the 5 subjects with chest pain after sumatriptan. The effect of sumatriptan on oesophageal function provides an alternative explanation for the chest symptoms.

[respiratory, ppra, reactivity, dpra, sensitizer, allergen, peptide]

Reactivity of Chemical Respiratory Allergens in the Peroxidase Peptide Reactivity Assay.
Sensitizing chemicals are commonly associated primarily with either skin or respiratory sensitization. In the Direct Peptide Reactivity Assay (DPRA), when compared with skin sensitizers, respiratory allergens have been demonstrated to selectively react with lysine rather than cysteine. The Peroxidase Peptide Reactivity Assay (PPRA) has been developed as a refinement to the DPRA. The PPRA incorporates dose-response analyses, mass spectroscopy for peptide detection and a horseradish peroxidase-hydrogen peroxide enzymatic system, increasing the potential to identify pro-haptens. In the investigations reported here, the PPRA was evaluated to determine whether it provides advantages for the identification of respiratory allergens. Twenty respiratory sensitizers, including five predicted to be pre-/pro-haptens were evaluated. The PPRA performed similarly to the DPRA with respect to indentifying inherently reactive respiratory sensitizers. However, three respiratory sensitizers predicted to be pre-/pro-haptens (chlorhexidine, ethylenediamine and piperazine) were non-reactive and the general selectivity of the respiratory allergens for lysine was lost in the PPRA. Overall, the data indicate that the PPRA does not provide an advantage over the DPRA for discriminating allergens as either contact or respiratory sensitizers. Nevertheless, the PPRA provides a number of refinements to the DPRA that allow for an enhanced characterization of reactivity for both classes of chemical allergens.

[patient, tissue, soft, trial, technique, mucosa, flap, implant, dental, flapless]

Interventions for replacing missing teeth: management of soft tissues for dental implants.
BACKGROUND: Dental implants are usually placed by elevating a soft tissue flap, but in some instances, they can also be placed flapless reducing patient discomfort. Several flap designs and suturing techniques have been proposed. Soft tissues are often manipulated and augmented for aesthetic reasons. It is often recommended that implants are surrounded by a sufficient width of attached/keratinised mucosa to improve their long-term prognosis. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether (1a) flapless procedures are beneficial for patients, and (1b) which is the ideal flap design; whether (2a) soft tissue correction/augmentation techniques are beneficial for patients, and (2b) which are the best techniques; whether (3a) techniques to increase the peri-implant keratinised mucosa are beneficial for patients, and (3b) which are the best techniques; and (4) which are the best suturing techniques/materials. SEARCH METHODS: The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 9 June 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 9 June 2011), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 9 June 2011). Several dental journals were handsearched. There were no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of root-form osseointegrated dental implants, with a follow-up of at least 6 months after function, comparing various techniques to handle soft tissues in relation to dental implants. Outcome measures, according to the different hypotheses, were: prosthetic and implant failures, biological complications, aesthetics evaluated by patients and dentists, postoperative pain, marginal peri-implant bone level changes on periapical radiographs, patient preference, ease of maintenance by patient, soft tissue thickness changes and attached/keratinised mucosa height changes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Screening of eligible studies, assessment of the methodological quality of the trials and data extraction were conducted at least in duplicate and independently by two or more review authors. Trial authors were contacted for missing information. Results were expressed using risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals. MAIN RESULTS: Seventeen potentially eligible RCTs were identified but only six trials with 138 patients in total could be included. One study was at low risk of bias, two studies were judged to be at unclear risk of bias and three at high risk of bias. Two trials (56 patients) compared flapless placement of dental implants with conventional flap elevation, one trial (10 patients) compared crestal versus vestibular incisions, one trial (20 patients) Erbium:YAG laser versus flap elevation at the second-stage surgery for implant exposure, one split-mouth trial (10 patients) evaluated whether connective tissue graft at implant placement could be effective in augmenting peri-implant tissues, and one trial (40 patients) compared autograft with an animal-derived collagen matrix to increase the height of the keratinised mucosa. On a patient, rather than per implant basis, implants placed with a flapless technique and implant exposures performed with laser induced statistically significantly less postoperative pain than flap elevation. Sites augmented with soft tissues connective grafts showed a better aesthetic and thicker tissues. Both palatal autografts or the use of a porcine-derived collagen matrix are effective in increasing the height of keratinised mucosa at the price of a 0.5 mm recession of peri-implant soft tissues. There were no other statistically significant differences for any of the remaining analyses. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is limited weak evidence suggesting that flapless implant placement is feasible and has been shown to reduce patient postoperative discomfort in adequately selected patients, that augmentation at implant sites with soft tissue grafts is effective in increasing soft tissue thickness improving aesthetics and that one technique to increase the height of keratinised mucosa using autografts or an animal-derived collagen matrix was able to achieve its goal but at the price of a worsened aesthetic outcome (0.5 mm of recession). There is insufficient reliable evidence to provide recommendations on which is the ideal flap design, the best soft tissue augmentation technique, whether techniques to increase the width of keratinised/attached mucosa are beneficial to patients or not, and which are the best incision/suture techniques/materials. Properly designed and conducted RCTs, with at least 6 months of follow-up, are needed to provide reliable answers to these questions.

[district, nurse, stroke, patient, care, community]

Stroke nursing care and management in the community: a survey of district nurses' perceived contribution in one health district in England.
Little appears to have been written about how district nurses perceive their role in relation to the care and management of stroke patients in the community despite the high number of stroke patients on their case loads. A qualitative study using a semi-structured interview was undertaken with a convenience sample of 30 district nurses representing each locality in one health district in England. Findings suggest that district nurses do not have a major role in the rehabilitation of stroke patients in the community and generally become involved in their care once the patient's chronicity has reached the point of inability to meet self-care demand, or the carer is unable to cope.

[therapy, antitumor, ikdc, il-2, combination, cell, im, effect, il-15]

The critical role of IL-15 in the antitumor effects mediated by the combination therapy imatinib and IL-2.
The synergistic antitumor effects of the combination therapy imatinib mesylate (IM) and IL-2 depended upon NK1.1- expressing cells and were associated with the accumulation of CD11c(int)B220(+)NK1.1(+) IFN-producing killer dendritic cells (IKDC) into tumor beds. In this study, we show that the antitumor efficacy of the combination therapy was compromised in IL-15 and IFN-type 1R loss-of-function mice. IL-15Ralpha was required for the proliferation of IKDC during IM plus IL-2 therapy. Trans-presentation of IL-15/IL-15Ralpha activated IKDC to express CCR2 and to respond to type 1 IFN by producing CCL2. Moreover, the antitumor effects of the combination therapy correlated with a CCL2-dependent recruitment of IKDC, but not B220(-) NK cells, into tumor beds. Altogether, the IL-15-driven peripheral expansion and the CCL-2-dependent intratumoral chemoattraction of IKDC are two critical parameters dictating the antitumor efficacy of IM plus IL-2 in mice.

[bowel, irritable, syndrome, non-colonic, rr, feature, disease, symptom, risk]

More accurate diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome by the use of 'non-colonic' symptomatology.
The criteria now used in an attempt to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome from organic gastrointestinal disease rely almost entirely on symptoms of colonic origin. 'Non-colonic' symptoms, however, arising either from elsewhere in the gut or of a more general nature, are common in irritable bowel syndrome and may have even better diagnostic potential. The prevalence of these non-colonic features was assessed in 107 patients with the irritable bowel syndrome and 295 subjects with other gut disorders. Gastrointestinal type non-colonic symptoms are useful in differentiating irritable bowel syndrome from inflammatory bowel disease but, with the exception of early satiety, are not helpful when there is gastro-oesophageal or biliary disease. More general 'non-colonic' features, such as lethargy and backache, are much commoner in irritable bowel syndrome than in all the organic gastrointestinal diseases studied and have good discriminant function. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified certain features that had a particularly significant independent risk for irritable bowel syndrome. Those were lethargy (relative risk 6.7), incomplete evacuation (RR 5.2), age under 40 (RR 2.1), backache (RR 2.0), early satiety (RR 1.8), and frequency of micturition (RR 1.8). These relative risks can be multiplied together to give an overall risk when more than one of these features is present in a patient. Until a diagnostic test is available more confident diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome can be achieved by identifying symptoms that have good discriminant function. The results of this study indicate that the non-colonic features of irritable bowel syndrome may be especially valuable in this respect.

[guideline, antipsychotic, treatment, atypical, schizophrenia, drug, patient]

Guidelines for antipsychotic drug treatment of schizophrenia.
Rationale: The SiGMA algorithm and corresponding guidelines for the antipsychotic treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders were developed out of the finding that across the twelve provider units of Greater Manchester, the use of, and expenditure on, clozapine and the other new atypical antipsychotic drugs varied greatly. There were no locally agreed standards or guidelines in place for the prescription of such drugs. Individual Trusts varied in whether they had current guidelines for the prescription of antipsychotic medication, the content of such guidelines, and the extent to which the guidelines were being followed by clinicians.The SiGMA guidelines have been adapted by the Manchester Mental Health and Social Care Trust Medicines Management Committee taking into account the NICE Guidelines ‘Guidance on the use of newer (atypical) antipsychotic drugs for the treatment of schizophrenia’.Scope: The guidelines and accompanying algorithm offer a first-line choice of atypical or conventional antipsychotic treatment to be made in consultation with the patient, although the preferred treatment of choice would be an atypical antipsychotic. The algorithm avoids unnecessary delays in proceeding to clozapine, if appropriate and recognises evidence for psychological therapies in improving the outcome for patients with schizophrenia.Patient group: Primarily patients aged between 16-64 years with schizophrenia or related functional disorders. For patients with these conditions who are elderly, lower doses than in younger adults should be considered and particular attention paid to side-effects.

Pilot randomized trial of therapeutic hypothermia with serial cranial ultrasound and 18-22 month follow-up for neonatal encephalopathy in a low resource hospital setting in Uganda: study protocol.
BACKGROUND: There is now convincing evidence that in industrialized countries therapeutic hypothermia for perinatal asphyxial encephalopathy increases survival with normal neurological function. However, the greatest burden of perinatal asphyxia falls in low and mid-resource settings where it is unclear whether therapeutic hypothermia is safe and effective. AIMS: Under the UCL Uganda Women's Health Initiative, a pilot randomized controlled trial in infants with perinatal asphyxia was set up in the special care baby unit in Mulago Hospital, a large public hospital with ~20,000 births in Kampala, Uganda to determine:(i) The feasibility of achieving consent, neurological assessment, randomization and whole body cooling to a core temperature 33-34°C using water bottles(ii) The temperature profile of encephalopathic infants with standard care(iii) The pattern, severity and evolution of brain tissue injury as seen on cranial ultrasound and relation with outcome(iv) The feasibility of neurodevelopmental follow-up at 18-22 months of age METHODS/DESIGN: Ethical approval was obtained from Makerere University and Mulago Hospital. All infants were in-born. Parental consent for entry into the trial was obtained. Thirty-six infants were randomized either to standard care plus cooling (target rectal temperature of 33-34°C for 72 hrs, started within 3 h of birth) or standard care alone. All other aspects of management were the same. Cooling was performed using water bottles filled with tepid tap water (25°C). Rectal, axillary, ambient and surface water bottle temperatures were monitored continuously for the first 80 h. Encephalopathy scoring was performed on days 1-4, a structured, scorable neurological examination and head circumference were performed on days 7 and 17. Cranial ultrasound was performed on days 1, 3 and 7 and scored. Griffiths developmental quotient, head circumference, neurological examination and assessment of gross motor function were obtained at 18-22 months. DISCUSSION: We will highlight differences in neonatal care and infrastructure that need to be taken into account when considering a large safety and efficacy RCT of therapeutic hypothermia in low and mid resource settings in the future.

[bowel, irritable, syndrome, cytokine, genotype, patient, interleukin, anti-inflammatory, inflammatory, genetic]

Interleukin 10 genotypes in irritable bowel syndrome: evidence for an inflammatory component?
BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammation may play a role in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome in some individuals, such as in those who develop symptoms following a dysenteric illness. Persisting inflammation, resulting from an imbalance of cytokines regulating the inflammatory response, is one possible mechanism. As the elaboration of cytokines is under genetic control, this study was designed to establish whether there might be a genetic predisposition to an altered pattern of anti-inflammatory cytokine production in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. SUBJECTS: A total of 230 unselected patients with irritable bowel syndrome and 450 healthy, ethnically matched controls were studied. METHODS: DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes of subjects. Allele and genotype frequencies were determined for the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 at the site (-1082) concerned with production in lymphocytes. Transforming growth factor beta(1) (codons 10 and 25) genotypes were also examined in a smaller group of subjects. RESULTS: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome had significantly reduced frequencies of the high producer genotype for interleukin 10 than controls (21% v 32%; p=0.003). There was no apparent relationship with any particular bowel habit subtype. Genotypes for transforming growth factor beta(1) were not altered. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest that at least some patients with irritable bowel syndrome may be genetically predisposed to produce lower amounts of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10. This lends some support to the hypothesis that there may be an inflammatory or genetic component in some cases of this condition and that further studies in specific irritable bowel syndrome subgroups are justified.

[month, asthma, posaconazole, patient, voriconazole, abpa, saf]

Voriconazole and posaconazole improve asthma severity in allergic                    bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and severe asthma with fungal                    sensitization.
Rationale and objectives. Severe asthma with fungal sensitization                        (SAFS) and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) are progressive                        allergic fungal lung diseases whose effective treatment remains to be                        established. Current treatment with itraconazole is associated with a 40%                        failure rate and adverse events (AEs). We assessed the effect of                        voriconazole or posaconazole as second- and third-line therapies. Methods.                        We conducted a retrospective review of adult asthmatic patients with either                        ABPA or SAFS receiving voriconazole or posaconazole. Clinical, radiological,                        and immunological evaluation was used to assess response. Results. There                        were 25 patients, ABPA (n = 20) or SAFS (n = 5), 10 males, median age = 58                        years. All patients had failed itraconazole (n = 14) or developed AEs (n =                        11). There were 33 courses of therapy analyzed, 24 with voriconazole and 9                        with posaconazole. Clinical response to voriconazole was observed in 17/24                        (70%) patients at 3 months, 15/20 (75%) at 6 months, and 12/16 (75%) at 12                        months compared with 7/9 (78%) at 3, 6, and 12 months for posaconazole.                        Eighteen of 24 (75%) patients discontinued oral corticosteroids (OCS), 12 of                        them within 3 months of therapy. Asthma severity was downgraded from severe                        to moderate (n = 8) and moderate to mild (n = 1) asthma in 9 of 24 (38%)                        asthmatic patients. There was a marked reduction in OCS and short-acting                        beta-2 agonist use, health-care utilization due to asthma, and improvement                        in overall health status. Furthermore, there was a statistically significant                        reduction in immunological markers appearing at 9 months (p = .008) for                        total IgE and at 12 months for radioallergosorbent test IgE for Aspergillus                        fumigatus (p = .0056). Six of 23 (26%) patients on voriconazole had AEs                        requiring discontinuation before 6 months compared with none on posaconazole                        (p = .15). Four relapsed (57%), one at 3 months and three at 12 months after                        discontinuation. Conclusion. Both voriconazole and posaconazole are                        potentially effective alternative treatment options for SAFS and ABPA and                        may improve asthma control and reduce severity, though larger prospective                        studies are required to support these retrospective study                        findings.

[airway, infection, rsv, remodelling, inflammation, mouse]

Respiratory syncytial virus infection provokes airway remodelling in allergen-exposed mice in absence of prior allergen sensitization.
BACKGROUND: The mechanisms underlying exacerbation of asthma induced by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection have been extensively studied in human and animal models. However, most of these studies focused on acute inflammation and little is known of its long-term consequences on remodelling of the airway tissue. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to use a murine model of prolonged allergen-induced airway inflammation to investigate the effect of RSV infection on allergic airway inflammation and tissue remodelling. METHODS: We subjected mice to RSV infection before or during the chronic phase of airway challenges with OVA and compared parameters of airway inflammation and remodelling at the end-point of the prolonged allergen-induced airway inflammation protocol. RESULTS: RSV infection did not affect the severity of airway inflammation in any of the groups studied. However, RSV infection provoked airway remodelling in non-sensitized, allergen-challenged mice that did not otherwise develop any of the features of allergic airways disease. Increased collagen synthesis in the lung and thickening of the bronchial basal membrane was observed in non-sensitized allergen-challenged mice only after prior RSV infection. In addition, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 but not TGF-beta(1) was increased in this group following RSV infection. CONCLUSION: Our data show for the first time that RSV infection can prime the lung of mice that are not previously systemically sensitized, to develop airway remodelling in response to allergen upon sole exposure via the airways. Moreover, our results implicate RSV-induced FGF-2 in the remodelling process in vivo.

[biomarker, mortality, clinical, addition, predictive, obstructive, history, bode, pulmonary, chronic]

Inflammatory biomarkers improve clinical prediction of mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
RATIONALE: Accurate prediction of mortality helps select patients for interventions aimed at improving outcome. OBJECTIVES: Because chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized by low-grade systemic inflammation, we hypothesized that addition of inflammatory biomarkers to established predictive factors will improve accuracy. METHODS: A total of 1,843 patients enrolled in the Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints study were followed for 3 years. Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank analysis, and Cox proportional hazards analyses determined the predictive value for mortality of clinical variables, while C statistics assessed the added discriminative power offered by addition of biomarkers. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At recruitment we measured anthropometrics, spirometry, 6-minute walk distance, dyspnea, BODE index, history of hospitalization, comorbidities, and computed tomography scan emphysema. White blood cell and neutrophil counts, serum or plasma levels of fibrinogen, chemokine ligand 18, surfactant protein D, C-reactive protein, Clara cell secretory protein-16, IL-6 and -8, and tumor necrosis factor-α were determined at recruitment and subsequent visits. A total of 168 of the 1,843 patients (9.1%) died. Nonsurvivors were older and had more severe airflow limitation, increased dyspnea, higher BODE score, more emphysema, and higher rates of comorbidities and history of hospitalizations. The best predictive model for mortality using clinical variables included age, BODE, and hospitalization history (C statistic of 0.686; P < 0.001). One single biomarker (IL-6) significantly improved the C statistic to 0.708, but this was further improved to 0.726 (P = 0.003) by the addition of all biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of a panel of selected biomarkers improves the ability of established clinical variables to predict mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00292552).

[finding, bowel, inflammatory, symptom, improvement, patient]

Refractory inflammatory bowel disease-could it be an irritable bowel?
Patients with IBD who are apparently in remission-as indicated by normal blood tests, endoscopic findings and ultrasonography results-often continue to experience symptoms. Furthermore, despite these negative findings, there is a temptation to increase their anti-inflammatory medication in the hope that this approach would lead to some improvement. However, this strategy often seems to fail and can sometimes lead to adverse events. Consequently, when evidence of continuing inflammatory activity is lacking it might be appropriate to consider the possibility of co-existent IBS in these patients and to treat them for this condition. Dietary manipulation, antispasmodic agents, antidepressants (especially of the tricyclic variety) and even behavioural treatments might result in a worthwhile improvement of symptoms.

[lung, infection]

Respiratory viral infections: knowledge based therapeutics.
Lung viral infections continue to kill millions of people worldwide. Virus-specific properties, replication kinetics and longevity affect the subsequent vigour of innate and adaptive immunity, which contribute to clinical manifestations. The point at which lung innate immunity activates is different between individuals and is determined by age, genetics, underlying conditions and infection history. On resolution of virus-induced lung disease an 'altered state of homeostasis' exists that in turn affects the next antigenic challenge. The last two years has produced a plethora of studies on the resolution of inflammatory lung disease; highlighting potential for immune modulation. In the future a more precise etiological diagnosis, combined with a knowledge of co-morbidities and an immune signature will lead to the development of more specifically targeted therapeutics.

Forty patients with irritable bowel syndrome received an antigen-exclusion diet identical to that previously reported to be highly effective in this condition. Only 15% of the group as a whole showed evidence of food intolerance manifested by an improvement in their irritable bowel symptoms. In a further 12.5% only well-being improved and this did not seem to be related to the exclusion of any particular food. Patients whose bowel dysfunction was characterized by diarrhea responded the best (3/8) whereas those with constipation consistently failed to improve.

[patient, control, ib, synesthesium, sensory, reproducibility]

Synesthesia, pseudo-synesthesia, and irritable bowel syndrome.
BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Synesthesia is a sensory disorder where the stimulation of one sensory modality can lead to a reaction in another which would not usually be expected to respond; for instance, someone might see a color on hearing a word such as a day of the week. Disordered perception of sensory information also appears to contribute to the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The purpose of this exploratory study was to ascertain whether these two conditions might be linked in any way. METHODS: Two hundred consecutive IBS outpatients were screened for synesthesia and compared with 200 matched healthy volunteers (controls). Positive responders were tested for two types of synesthesia (grapheme-color and music-color/shape) using a questionnaire which was repeated after 3 months to test for reproducibility. RESULTS: Of the 200 IBS outpatients screened, 26 (13%) patients and six (3%) controls claimed to be synesthetic (P < 0.001). Reproducibility was more variable in IBS patients than controls but despite this variability, 15 (7.5%) patients compared with 5 (2.5%) controls had greater than 75% consistency (P = 0.036), and 19 (9.5%) patients and 6 (3%) controls had greater than 50% consistency (P = 0.012). A reproducibility of less than 50% was observed in seven (3.5%) patients and no controls (0%) (P = 0.015), and these individuals were classified as having pseudo-synesthesia. CONCLUSION: IBS patients clearly differ from controls in terms of claiming to have synesthetic experiences. These results justify additional studies on the relationship between IBS and synesthesia to further understand the neural mechanisms underpinning these two conditions and to establish whether they may be linked.

[infection, respiratory]

Respiratory infections: do we ever recover?
Although the outcome of respiratory infection alters with age, nutritional status, and immunologic competence, there is a growing body of evidence that we all develop a unique but subtle inflammatory profile. This uniqueness is determined by the sequence of infections or antigenic insults encountered that permanently mold our lungs through experience. This experience and learning process forms the basis of immunologic memory that is attributed to the acquired immune system. But what happens if the pathogen is not homologous to any preceding it? In the absence of cross-specific acquired immunity, one would expect a response similar to that of a subject who had never been infected with anything before. It is now clear that this is not the case. Prior inflammation in the respiratory tract alters immunity and pathology to subsequent infections even when they are antigenically distinct. Furthermore, the influence of the first infection is long lasting, not dependent on the presence of T and B cells, and effective against disparate pathogen combinations. We have used the term "innate imprinting" to explain this phenomenon, although innate education may be a closer description. This educational process, by sequential waves of infection, may be beneficial, as shown for successive viral infections, or significantly worse, as illustrated by the increased susceptibly to life-threatening bacterial pneumonia in patients infected with seasonal and pandemic influenza. We now examine what these long-term changes involve, the likely cell populations affected, and what this means to those studying inflammatory disorders in the lung.

[system, bowel, irritable, patient, syndrome, score, severity]

The irritable bowel severity scoring system: a simple method of monitoring irritable bowel syndrome and its progress.
BACKGROUND: The clinical assessment and investigation of irritable bowel syndrome would be greatly facilitated by the introduction of a simple, easy to use severity scoring system. Such a system, developed in our department over a number of years, has been submitted to validation in a total of 141 patients and 40 healthy controls. METHODS: The system, incorporating pain, distension, bowel dysfunction and quality of life/global well-being, was assessed for its ability to reliably score patients previously classified as mild, moderate or severe. The reproducibility and sensitivity to change of the system was also assessed. RESULTS: The maximum achievable score was 500. Mild, moderate and severe cases were indicated by scores of 75 to 175, 175 to 300 and > 300 respectively. Controls scored below 75 and patients scoring in this range can be considered to be in remission. There was a highly significant difference between controls and patients as a whole (P = 0.0001) as well as significant differences (P < 0.01) between all severity categories. Scores repeated within 24 h were very reproducible and sensitivity to change was also extremely good (P < 0.001) with a change of 50 reliably indicating improvement. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that this scoring system should prove to be a valuable instrument in helping to meet the many challenges offered by irritable bowel syndrome.
