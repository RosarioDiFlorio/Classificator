Not entirely unpredictably, the country's notoriously prudish viewing public aren't universally taken with the alcohol-fuelled, sex-suffused series. In fact, a furore has broken out.", "", "And what a furore. First the Parents Television Council (PTC) described the programme – before it had even aired – as \"the most dangerous show for children... ever seen\". Then, on Thursday, Viacom, the conglomerate which owns MTV, instructed producers to \"tone down\" explicit content.", "", "Finally, the US Senate made its disapproval known, requesting the PTC to investigate whether the programme might, with its regular depictions of teenage nudity and sex, violate child pornography laws. Much of this is par for the course. Indeed, Skins' ability to shock is, by and large, its USP. Certainly, the PTC's pre-emptive cautions did little to dent the premiere's audience share. Some 3.3 million Americans tuned in on Monday night, setting a new record for the channel's ability to attract viewers aged 12 to 34. Despite its being rated as suitable only for over-17s, more than a million of those viewers were 18 or younger.", "", "Indeed, in the UK it has largely been this very courting of controversy which has made Skins a hit. Drugs, sex, abortion and self-harm have each been examined in all-too-intimate detail, woven between scenes from all-night parties and drinks binges.", "", "Since the first series aired on E4 in 2007, it has attracted viewing figures in the millions, become the most successful British programme in the channel's history, and attracted slavish devotion amongst fans. Much of the cast – many of them first-time actors who are replaced each series as they \"graduate\" secondary school – have become recognisable faces. The show's Twitter feed has upwards of 83,000 followers and a spin-off novel has been penned.", "", "More than that, though, Skins has assumed a clear spot in popular consciousness. Attend a \"Skins party\" and you will (observes the oracle that is Urban Dictionary) be attending \"a huge party in someone's house where nearly everything is broken, lots of people are having sex and almost everyone is either drunk or drugged up\". When, in summer 2007, teenagers everywhere donned neon accessories and smeared glow-in-the-dark paint on their faces, it was Skins that they were aping. This, admirers noted, was largely down to the producers' novel approach.", "", "The brainchild of television writer Bryan Elsley, the show has had its script shaped by a collective of young people. Fresh out of university, Elsley's son, Jamie Brittain, came on board as a co-creator and together they scoured drama schools and theatres for would-be writers. The result was a script which combined genuine knowledge of young people's behaviour with an understanding of their aspirations. Not every pupil was spending their weekend popping illegal pills at a rave – but, given the chance, observed Skins writers, they probably wouldn't mind.", "", "Elsley and Brittain also adopted a soundtrack which distinguished Skins from your run-of-the-mill teen drama. When American band Gossip's single \"Standing in the Way of Control\" was selected as the theme tune for the first series, it went from being an obscure indie track to a top-10 smash hit.", "", "A similar service has been extended to Late of the Pier, Ladyhawke, Foals and MGMT. Indeed, so successful has Skins become in breaking new bands, that in 2009 NME named the show's music supervisor, Alex Hancock, the 24th most important person in the music industry. Like its American cousin, the British version has not been without controversy. It has been blamed for skewing teens' sexual values, aggravating binge drinking and encouraging online-organised mass house parties. Yet, there's little sign of the bandwagon slowing – as well as MTV's adaptation, a film is in the pipeline. At auditions for the next series, more than 8,000 hopefuls turned up.", "", "So what to make of the fuss across the pond? Perhaps it will prevent parents from letting their kids watch it. Almost certainly, forthcoming episodes will not be as provocative. But the controversy will only fan the flames of Skins' popularity. That is, after all, the point." ],

Schumpeterian analysis requires an intuitively appealing and realistic conceptualization of the distinction between routine and innovative behavior, and in particular, a conceptualization relevant to complex organizations and complex tasks. It is argued that the production theory found in mainstream economics does not meet this requirement, particularly because its characterization of productive knowledge involves an overly sharp distinction between “technically possible” and “technically impossible”—a distinction which has no counterpart in the realities of organizational knowledge. The main elements of a Schumpeterian view are described and contrasted with those in the mainstream view." ],

We use harmonized firm-level data drawn from business registers or social security records.These data enable international comparisons and the identification of idiosyncratic country effects. While average firm size differs across countries, due to both sectoral specialization and within-sector characteristics, we find similar degrees of firm churning across countries. In most of them, about 20% of firms enter and exit most markets every year; and about 20–40% of entering firms fail within the first 2 years of life. However, post-entry growth of successful entrants is much higher in the USA than in Europe, which may be indicative of barriers to firm growth as opposed to barriers to entry." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Where do transactions come from? Modularity, transactions, and the boundaries of firms", "This article constructs a theory of the location of transactions and the boundaries of firms in a productive system. It proposes that systems of production can be viewed as networks, in which tasks-cum-agents are the nodes and transfers—of material, energy and information—between tasks and agents are the links. Transactions are defined as mutually agreed-upon transfers with compensation and are located within the task network. Placing a transaction in a particular location in turn requires work to define, count (or measure), and pay for the transacted objects. The costs of this work (labeled mundane transaction costs) are generally low at the thin crossing points of the task network, which correspond to module boundaries. Therefore, transactions are more likely to be located at module boundaries than in their interiors. Several implications arise from this theory. Among these: Modularizations create new module boundaries, hence new transaction locations. Areas in the task network where transfers are dense and complex should be located in transaction-free zones, so that the cost of transacting does not overburden the system. The thin crossing points between transaction-free zones constitute breakpoints, where firms and industries may split apart." ],

Because of similarities between those neural precursor cells and stem cells that turn into glioblastomas, Rich’s team suspected the virus might also target the cells that cause the notoriously deadly type of cancer. In the United States, about 12,000 people are expected to be diagnosed with glioblastoma in 2017. (It’s the type of cancer U.S. Senator John McCain was found to have in July.) Even with treatment, most patients live only about a year after diagnosis, and tumors frequently recur.", "", "In cultures of human cells, Zika infected glioblastoma stem cells and halted their growth, Rich and colleagues report. The virus also infected full-blown glioblastoma cells but at a lower rate, and didn’t infect normal brain tissues. Zika-infected mice with glioblastoma either saw their tumors shrink or their tumor growth slow compared with uninfected mice. The virus-infected mice lived longer, too. In one trial, almost half of the mice survived more than six weeks after being infected with Zika, while all of the uninfected mice died within two weeks of receiving a placebo.", "", "Using a virus to knock out cancer isn’t a completely new idea.

Then, as those cancer cells split open, previously hidden tumor fragments become visible to the immune system, which can recognize and fight them.", "", "“Right now we don’t know what kind of viruses are best” for fighting cancer, Zloza says — whether it’s more effective to use a common virus that many people have been exposed to or something more unusual. But now, Zika is yet another candidate.", "", "Further testing is needed to determine whether the virus is safe and effective in humans. Since Zika’s effects are more harmful in developing brains, a Zika-based cancer therapy might be safe only in adults. And the virus would need to be genetically modified to make it safer and less transmissible.", "", "Rich and colleagues are now testing in mice whether combining Zika with traditional cancer treatments such as chemotherapy is more effective than either treatment by itself.

But few of these have been tested in animals. Now in study appearing in ACS' Journal of Natural Products, scientists report that one of these previously untested compounds appears to improve cell function and insulin sensitivity in laboratory mice. The finding could spur the development of new drugs to treat or even prevent the disease.", "", "Some studies suggest that drinking three to four cups of coffee a day can reduce the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, a disease that afflicts nearly 30 million Americans. Initially, scientists suspected that caffeine was responsible for this effect. But later findings discounted this possibility, suggesting that other substances in coffee may have a more important role. In a previous laboratory study, Fredrik Brustad Mellbye, Søren Gregersen and colleagues found that a compound in coffee called cafestol increased insulin secretion in pancreatic cells when they were exposed to glucose. Cafestol also increased glucose uptake in muscle cells just as effectively as a commonly prescribed antidiabetic drug. In this new study, the researchers wanted to see if cafestol would help prevent or delay the onset of Type 2 diabetes in mice.", "", "The researchers divided mice that are prone to develop Type 2 diabetes into three groups. Two of the groups were fed differing doses of cafestol. After 10 weeks, both sets of cafestol-fed mice had lower blood glucose levels and improved insulin secretory capacity compared to a control group, which was not given the compound. Cafestol also didn't result in hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, a possible side effect of some antidiabetic medications. The researchers conclude that daily consumption of cafestol can delay the onset of Type 2 diabetes in these mice, and that it is a good candidate for drug development to treat or prevent the disease in humans." ],

In particular, by experimental and theoretical approaches, they demonstrated that pure diffusion in a growing tissue is sufficient to explain the AN3 gradient formation. This work provides evidence that the diffusion-based model of morphogen is viable in developmental patterning of multicellular organisms.", "", "Spatial gradient of signaling molecules is critical for establishing developmental patterns of multicellular organisms. Around half a century ago, a seminal work proposed a theory that pure diffusion of signaling molecules from a restricted source may explain the establishment of such tissue-scale gradients (Crick, 1970). Despite the prominence of this diffusion-based model in development, quantitative studies, largely performed in animals, have not yet demonstrated this simple mechanism in multicellular tissues.", "", "In an article published in Biophysical Journal, Dr. Kawade's team at OIBB/NIBB, in collaboration with scientists in the Institut Jacques Monod (France), Rikkyo University (Japan) and University of Tokyo (Japan), solved a long-standing argument of the diffusion-based model for morphogen gradient formation. They measured molecular transport through plasmodesmata, a unique cellular channel in plants directly connecting neighboring cells, by trans-scale FRAP (Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching) assays. This analyses revealed biophysical properties of diffusive molecular transport through plasmodesmata. Based on this diffusion-based framework, they succeeded in demonstrating that the AN3 gradient could be achieved solely by pure diffusion process through plasmodesmata in developing leaf primordia. Because the AN3 signaling gradient corresponds to the cell-proliferation domain, this study can explain how spatial and temporal dynamics of cell proliferation, and therefore tissue growth, is regulated during leaf development.", "", "These discoveries provide a significant step forward in our understanding of how the simple biophysical phenomena 'diffusion' governs developmental patterning in multicellular organisms.", "" ],

  "texts" : [ "Research shows how DNA molecules cross nanopores", "Research presented in a new paper co-authored by Northwestern University associate professor of mechanical engineering Sandip Ghosal sheds new light on how polymers cross tiny pores ten thousand times smaller than a human hair.", "", "These findings could propel a deeper understanding of the biophysics of living cells, the measurement of polymer properties in diverse chemical industries such as plastics manufacturing and food processing, and the design of biosensors.", "", "In the paper published Aug. 30 in Nature Communications, Ghosal and his co-authors present data showing how the speed of DNA changes as it enters or exits a nanopore. Surprisingly, the experiment showed that DNA molecules move faster as they enter a nanopore (forward translocation) and slower when they exit (backward translocation).", "", "What's happening with the DNA, Ghosal explains, is something familiar to mechanical engineers: a concept called \"buckling,\" studied by great scientific minds like Leonhard Euler and Daniel Bernoulli more than two centuries ago, but rarely studied at the molecular level.", "", "Ghosal and his collaborators concluded that DNA molecules buckle under the influence of compressive forces when entering the nanopore, but are pulled straight by tensile forces when moving in the opposite direction. The resulting difference in the geometric configuration results in greater hydrodynamic drag on the molecule in the latter case.", "", "The study was motivated by a desire to understand, in detail, the mechanics of a DNA molecule's passage through a nanopore, a subject of rich scientific curiosity and conjecture.", "", "\"We wanted to know what is happening to the DNA and why,\" says Ghosal, who also holds a courtesy appointment in the Department of Engineering Sciences and Applied Mathematics.", "", "Rather than simply determining the DNA's average speed of translocation, Ghosal's U.K.-based collaborators -- Ulrich F. Keyser, Maria Ricci, Kaikai Chen from the University of Cambridge, and Nicholas A.W. Bell, now of the University of Oxford -designed an innovative experiment to reveal the actual variation of the DNA's speed by inserting markers along the DNA molecule. This \"DNA ruler\" allowed the researchers to measure the speed of translocation at each instant. To then collect large amounts of data within a relatively short time period, the researchers repeatedly flipped the voltage across the pore, sending the DNA in and out of the nanopore in a \"ping-pong\" mode.", "", "The group's work builds on the \"resistive pulse\" technique introduced nearly 20 years ago for detecting and characterizing single molecules. That idea has since been applied to a variety of research, including the search for an ultra-fast method of DNA sequencing and the effort to rapidly measure the mechanical properties of cells.", "", "Ghosal describes his team's work as a potential \"first step in extending the resistive pulse method to determining the mechanical characteristics of polymers.\"", "", "Though Ghosal admits the work itself is purely curiosity-driven research designed to probe what more can be done with the resistive pulse technique, the findings could nevertheless have real-world applications in any area where the measurement of polymer properties is important.", "", "\"Each polymer has a characteristic load at which it will buckle and, therefore, the difference between the forward and backward translocation times provide a way of gauging the bending rigidity of polymers,\" Ghosal said. \"It is incredibly exciting that we can now observe this,\" Ghosal says." ],
