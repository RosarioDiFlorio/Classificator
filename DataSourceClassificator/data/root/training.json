We examined the social and clinical characteristics of pact cases in England and Wales using a national clinical survey sample of people who died by suicide pact and who had been in recent (<12 months) contact with mental health services. Over the study period (1996-2005), there were 278 cases of suicide who had died in a pact, 77 (28%) of whom had been in recent service contact. The most common cause of death overall was by carbon monoxide poisoning, but those in contact with services were more likely to use more violent methods compared with other pact victims. Nearly half (47%) had affective disorder and 68% had previously self-harmed. Over a quarter (29%) had died within 3 months of discharge from psychiatric care and 36% had missed their last service appointment. Pact cases were more likely than solitary suicide cases to have experienced recent adverse life events, typically family problems. Measures that may prevent suicide pacts in the mentally ill include the effective treatment of depression and closer supervision in both in-patient and community settings. Awareness of the family environment may contribute to reduced risk." ],

This fall is less severe after 1980. However, throughout the data period, consumption fall at the retirement age is fully explained by the expected fall in income, which contradicts the life cycle model, where consumption is independent of income. However, previous studies identified that consumption tracks income partially. This study also sheds further light on consumption fall in some different groups such as retired from government jobs, retired from private jobs, male headed households, female headed households and income quartiles. Again, in almost all cases, consumption fall is fully explained by observed fall in income." ],

  "texts" : [ "Addition of novel degenerate electrical waveform stimulation with photodynamic therapy significantly enhances its cytotoxic effect in keloid fibroblasts: first report of a potential combination therapy.", "BACKGROUND: We recently reported use of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for treating keloid disease (KD). However, in view of high recurrence rates post any treatment modality, adjuvant therapies should be considered. Additionally, we previously demonstrated the effect of a novel electrical waveform, the degenerate wave (DW) on differential gene expression in keloid fibroblasts. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we evaluated the in vitro cytotoxic effect of PDT at 5J/cm(2) and 10J/cm(2) of red light (633 ± 3nm) using 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) with and without DW, on keloid fibroblasts compared to normal skin fibroblasts. METHODS: The rate of intracellular photosensitizer (protoporphyrin IX, PPIX) generation and disintegration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, LDH cytotoxicity, WST-1 cytoproliferation, apoptosis by Caspase-3 activation, mitochondrial membrane potential assessment by JC-1 aggregates, qRT-PCR, flow cytometry and In-Cell Western Blotting were performed. RESULTS: PPIX accumulation and disintegration rate was higher in keloid than normal fibroblasts after incubation with MAL compared to ALA. Increased cytotoxicity and decreased cytoproliferation were observed for keloid fibroblasts after PDT+DW treatment compared to PDT alone. ROS generation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, apoptosis (Caspase-3 activation) and collagens I and III gene down-regulation were higher in keloid compared to normal skin fibroblasts after MAL-PDT+DW treatment. An increase in the number of cells entering apoptosis and necrosis was observed after PDT+DW treatment by flow cytometry analysis. All positive findings were statistically significant (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The cytotoxic effect of PDT on keloid fibroblasts can be enhanced significantly with addition of DW stimulation, indicating for the first time the utility of this potential combinational therapy." ],

We explore supplier market knowledge acquisition, relationship learning, systems collaboration, and technological uncertainty as antecedents of supplier innovation generation, which is in turn hypothesized to positively affect the relationship performance of the supplier. Furthermore, supplier dependence on the buyer is investigated as a moderator of the effects of such antecedents on supplier innovation generation. Empirical tests, which used a sample of 236 Taiwanese executives, supported most of the hypotheses, and some implications of the results are discussed." ],

The use of a multi-method techniqueallowed primarily for the exploration of the “voices” of pupils in these schools, onthe topic of inclusive educational provision present in their schools. Teachers’interviews extended the image of the inclusive & multicultural education as itexisted in the schools studied.During the study the most significant barrier to non-Greek-Cypriot students’inclusion appeared to be the lack of Greek language skills, which affects theirsocialization, participation and achievement at school. Other barriers lie with thenegative attitudes of classmates and teaching staff in schools.

The Case of Internet IPOs", "The study of periods of market euphoria, such as Holland’s seventeenth-century tulip\nmania, England’s eighteenth-century South Sea Company, America’s nineteenth-century\nrailroads, or, most recently, the U.S. housing market, is a topic of long-standing interest to economists. Theorists specify conditions under which market participants and institutions cause \"bubbles\" to arise and persist and empiricists test participant-centric or institution- centric explanations (Hong, Scheinkman, and Xiong 2008; Schultz 2008; Greenwood and Nagel 2009). In this paper, we study a different participant other than one that stands to gain from price fluctuations. We are interested in how auditors behave during periods of market euphoria. Given their gatekeeper responsibility to act in the public’s interest, along with the seeming inevitability of bubbles (Rampell 2009), it is important to study how auditors behave during euphoric market conditions. To address this question, we examine auditor going-concern (GC) opinions around the time of the wave of stressed Internet firms filing to go public on NASDAQ, the capital markets entry point for the companies that went on to constitute \"dotcom mania\"." ],

The aim is to extend accounts of the inequalities and exploitation created by the credit bubble beyond the credit relations between lenders and borrowers. In doing so, it highlights three factors contributing to young adults and senor citizens indebtedness: (1) Persistently slow income growth over the past two decades is a major, and often overlooked, contributor to mounting household debt levels; (2) The culture of homeownership in the United States that was intimately bound up with the recent credit boom, which made sense of young adults becoming highly leveraged homeowners and senior citizens using their homes as ATMs; (3) In addition to funding consumption, debt is used as safety net to replace eroding public expenditure for social insurance and services. The emphasis here is on the cumulative effects of these three factors. Certainly the young and retired were affected in different ways, but with similar outcomes: rising indebtedness and growing financial insecurity. When we move beyond framing the excesses of the recent credit bubble using the narrow conception of the ‘subprime’ experience, we see that a wide cross-section of American society was made significantly worse off, both now and arguably well into the future." ],

I draw from my experiences dating from January of 2010 to the present. I begin by mapping out the student mobilizations that occurred between February 15th and March 4th of 2010 at UCSD in response to the UC budget crisis and the underrepresentation and under-servicing of black students on campus. This context provides a deeper understanding of the conflicts that Art Collective grappled with in our performances and activism. Next, I uncover some of the historical issues of racial and economic elitism that underscore UCSD's history and how this context informs the current power dynamics in the university's spaces. Using spatial and postcolonial theory, in addition to my personal reflections as a member of Art Collective, I assert that our public music making is a means through which we bodily reclaim institutional space and rearticulate our voices and identities on our own terms. Finally, after outlining some of our key performances, I situate Art Collective within a realm of processes: reflection, coalition building, and sharing subjectivities and experiences. These processes make the collective's performance style distinct, as it cultivates common bonds that strengthen community and foster personal growth.

We argue in this paper that lack of managerial capital has\nbroad implications for firm growth as well as for the effectiveness of other input factors. A large literature in development economics aims to understand the impediments to firm growth, particularly in small and medium enterprises. Standard growth theories have explored the importance of input factors such as capital and labor in the production function of firms and countries. At the micro level, empirical studies\nsuch as Suresh de Mel, David McKenzie and Christopher Woodruff (2008), Abhijit Banerjee\net al.

At the macro level, papers by Robert King and Ross Levine (1993), Raghuram Rajan and Luigi Zingales (1998), and Marianne Bertrand, Antoinette Schoar, and David Thesmar (2007) suggest the importance of the financial system for economic growth." ],

These measures were the most drastic set of changes to take place during the company’s 41-year history.  Through its campaign, company leadership downsized managers and hourly workers by the thousands, outsourced in-store operations, amalgamated departments, and all but eliminated full-time hourly work.  In my research based on over 50 interviews and three months of participant-observation, I found that the consequences of labour flexibilisation reverberated in ethnographically palpable ways throughout the social world of the workplace, affecting not only the role and status of workers, but also their relationships to each other and to the work that they do.  This paper suggests that while in some cases workers have responded to de-skilling and the fragmentation of workplace community by generating surprising new forms of social solidarity, overall the cuts have brought about a drastic reduction in job quality.  Ultimately, I suggest that Hometown’s participation in this ‘race to the bottom’ raises serious questions about the inevitability of these changes and the future of blue-collar jobs in deindustrialised America." ],

The aim of this study was to investigate whether evidence for the presence of bacteria, including Streptococcus pyogenes, can be demonstrated in the peripheral blood of patients with guttate and/or chronic plaque psoriasis. Peripheral blood samples from 20 patients with psoriasis, seven guttate, six chronic plaque and seven chronic plaque with associated guttate flare and from 16 control subjects were studied for the presence of bacteria by PCR using universal 16S ribosomal DNA primers and specific primers for S. pyogenes. Sequence analysis of amplified 16S rRNA sequences was used to determine taxonomic identity. Ribosomal bacterial DNA was detected in the blood of all 20 patients with psoriasis, but in none of the controls. Streptococci were detected in six of seven patients with guttate psoriasis, but none had staphylococci. In contrast, staphylococci were identified in 9 of 13 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, whilst only 2 demonstrated streptococci. In three psoriasis patients, species other than streptococci and staphylococci were identified. These findings suggest that psoriasis is associated with bacteraemia, with distinct taxonomic groups present in guttate and chronic plaque psoriatic subtypes. The causes of the bacteraemia and its implications in psoriasis have yet to be determined." ],

  "title" : "THE CHINESE MARKET FOR U.S. PORK EXPORTS",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "THE CHINESE MARKET FOR U.S. PORK EXPORTS", "China feeds twenty-two percent of the world's population on seven percent of its arable land. In contrast, the U.S. and Canada own seventeen percent of the world's arable land, but feed only five percent of its people. As China's income increases, its people will demand more livestock products, including poultry, dairy, beef, and eggs, and more alcohol. Potential Chinese import demand for pork is examined in this paper. The question facing Chinese policymakers is whether to follow their current policy of food self-sufficiency or allow imports of pork muscle and variety meats. Projections of Chinese production and consumption indicate that, by the year 2007, China could import up to 9.1 million metric tons (product weight equivalent) of pork. The current Chinese government is very opposed to food imports of any kind. However, China has applied for entry into the World Trade Organization. Negotiations on China's entry could include access to China's pork market, and it is most likely that access could be gained to the variety meat market. The implications of two opposing scenarios are examined in this paper: first, China continues its policy of self-sufficiency; or second, China allows imports of pork variety meats. Self-Sufficiency Scenario: The anticipated increase in livestock production will cause feed grain consumption in China to increase more rapidly than production. Once China becomes a permanent net importer of feed grains, its prices will rise to reflect world feed grain prices plus transportation costs. This development will make China's pork products more expensive than imports. This simple line of argument means that China is about to modernize and expand the world's largest pork industry in the wrong place. Expanding pork production in China instead of allowing imports from efficient producers will cause an enormous misallocation of world resources. The Chinese people would benefit more if China concentrated on labor intensive crops and allowed for the free importation of livestock products. Import Access Scenario: Where the pork market is concerned, U.S. and Chinese consumers complement each other. Chinese people like variety meats, whereas U.S. consumers prefer pork muscle meats. Because of its dominance in the world market, China would be able to determine world prices if it allowed free importation of variety meats. The drop credit, which is the value of the pork variety package, is estimated to increase by 45 percent. However, the increase in the value of the pork variety package would not imply an increase in prices in the U.S. domestic market which largely consumes pork muscle meats. Implications for U.S. Producers: Even if China does not allow imports of pork, U.S. producers will still benefit from increased Chinese demand. Due to projected increased consumption over the next ten years, it is likely that China will stop exporting its current level of 150,000 to 200,000 tons of pork muscle meat. If China does allow free importation of pork variety meats, the increased value of the U.S. drop credit would add $4.72 to the value of each hog carcass or about $1.90 per hundredweight. For the U.S. pork industry, the net annual benefit of access to the Chinese market would be approximately $300 million per year. Hayes argues that opening this market may be feasible as part of negotiations over China's entry to the World Trade Organization. Regardless of how Chinese pork market policy evolves, the demand for U.S. feed grain will increase, causing some movement of land in the U.S. from wheat production into feed grain production.China trade, livestock, feedgrains, meat, International Relations/Trade, F1," ],

The evaluation of the collected data, and the discussion within the group, permitted the formulation of comments and resulted in a revised framework of material considerations, useful during the design and selection process of a material.

The study of collective human dynamics, including collective aggression, has been the focus of much discussion in the context of modeling and identification of universal patterns of behavior. In contrast, the possibility that civil unrest activities, across countries and over long time periods, are governed by universal mechanisms has not been explored. Here, records of civil unrest of 170 countries during the period 1919–2008 are analyzed. It is demonstrated that the distributions of the number of unrest events per year are robustly reproduced by a nonlinear, spatially extended dynamical model, which reflects the spread of civil disorder between geographic regions connected through social and communication networks. The results also expose the similarity between global social instability and the dynamics of natural hazards and epidemics." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Between Orientalism and Affective Identification: A Paradigm and Four Case Studies Towards the Inclusion of the Moor in Cuban Literary and Cultural Studies", "This dissertation proposes an interpretive paradigm to explore the Moorish, Arab, Islamic and Algerian presence in Cuban literature and cultural studies, and it offers four case studies in which to do so.  The interpretative paradigm involves a dynamic between two coexisting approaches in Cuban cultural history.  The first is akin to Edward Said's notion of Orientalism, an exotization of the other that invites a critical stance.  The second, here called \"affective identification,\" signals the recognition of and connection with the other as an element of national identity.  The four case studies, which correspond to the chapters of the dissertation, are organized with a chronological movement from the nineteenth century until the present, and each is intended to underscore the links between the specific historical moment in question and significant aspects of Cuban literature and cultural studies. Chapter 1 argues that the intersection between the dominant white sector's view of an exclusively white Cuban national identity and specific historical and geopolitical circumstances of the early nineteenth century informs the representation of Muslim pirates in Cirilo Villaverde's <italic>Excursión a Vueltabajo</italic>. Chapter 2 proposes that changing attitudes towards slavery in the second half of the nineteenth century, as well as the rising importance of the eastern region of the country, among other factors, contributed to the representation of Moors and Arabs in Martí's poetic and political discourse (specifically, <italic>Ismaelillo</italic> and \"Los Moros en España\"), in keeping with the notion of affective identification.   Chapter 3 argues that the general interest in North Africa before the twentieth century, and the presence of the Moor in Cuban literature and nationalist discourse, contributed to the ways in which Algeria and Algerians were represented in Cuban print and television in the 50s and 60s. It gives pride of place to two works:  Jorge \"Papito\" Serguera's  <italic>Che Guevara, la clave Africana: Memorias de un embajador de Cuba en Argelia</italic> and Delia Fiallo's <italic>Bajo el cielo de Argelia</italic>, a soap opera about the Algerian struggle for liberation, broadcast in Cuba in 1962.  Chapter 4 relies on theories of loss to address the affective identification with the Moor in Abilio Estévez's <italic>Los palacios distantes</italic>, and with the Arab figure in Jesús Díaz's short story \"El pianista árabe\" that involves the experience of exile and loss at the turn of the twenty-first century.  The dissertation concludes suggesting several ways in which the inclusion of Arab and Islamic elements can enrich the study of both Cuban and Latin American literary and cultural studies." ],

Primed T cells are required for virus clearance, but are causally implicated in the enhanced pathology seen following RSV infection of some infants and experimental animals vaccinated against the virus. In BALB/c mice, vaccination with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the viral attachment protein (G) leads to pulmonary eosinophilia during subsequent infection, which indirect evidence suggests may be due to CD4+ Th2 cells. The production of IFN-gamma, IL-2, -4, -5 and -10 cytokine mRNA by RT-PCR and intracellular cytokines by flow cytometry following RSV challenge of vaccinated mice were therefore compared. Lung eosinophilia was associated with enhanced local recruitment of CD4+ cells in G sensitized mice, while CD8+ cells dominated in mice vaccinated with the viral fusion protein (F) or second matrix protein (M2). Lung eosinophilia was also associated with a localized reduction in IFN-gamma and increased IL-4 and IL-5 mRNA transcription as well as elevated RSV specific IgG1 antibody production. Th2 cytokine protein production by T cells showed no apparent change. Although IFN-gamma production diminished in eosinophilic mice, it remained the major cytokine found in lung T cells. It was concluded that lung eosinophilia can develop despite abundant IFN-gamma production by local T cells, but is associated with a shift in the balance between Th2 and Th1 cytokine production." ],

  "texts" : [ "SADIe:Structural-Semantics for Accessibility and Device Independence (SADIe Technical Report)", "The World Wide Web (Web) has evolved from a predominantly text-based resource into a visually complex, dynamic, multimedia system that incorporates images, video and scripting languages. Most Web designers make use of this multimedia to think of elaborate ways of presenting their data in a visual manner. Visually impaired users, who access the Web through alternative devices such as screen readers, find it difficult to access Web content because it is not designed with their needs in mind. Screen readers access Web content via the explicit underlying structure of the Web page. Implicit information designed for sighted users is inaccessible to screen readers and therefore visually impaired users. In order to cope with this difficulty, users' employ coping strategies, which are techniques designed to improve access to inaccessible Web pages.   The Semantic Web is an evolution of the current Web, through which the meaning of data and information is available to both machines and humans. Technologies such as XML, RDF and OWL have been developed to support machine understanding of information on the Web. SADIe uses Semantic Web technologies, in particular ontologies, to explicate implicitly rendered information. The ontology consists of two parts. The first is an upper ontology containing high level abstract concepts representing the potential roles of Web page elements. The second is a Website specific extension to the upper ontology. This contains the elements found within the CSS plus the roles that they play. SADIe uses the ontology combination to apply transcoding to pages within a Website in order to improve access for people with visual impairments, and hence reduce the need for coping strategies.   SADIe's approach of using upper level ontologies to offer site wide transcoding offers a \"high gain, low pain\" technique. SADIe improves access to the Web for people with visual impairments, without overly impeding Web designers in their primary job of creating visually stunning and interesting Websites." ],

The study was a systematic review and subsequent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that used Ca supplementation as an intervention in persons 18 or more years of age, and that reported body weight as a final outcome. A total of thirteen randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. There was no association between the increased consumption of either Ca supplements or dairy products and weight loss after adjusting for differences in baseline weights between the control and intervention groups (P=0.19 and 0.85, respectively).

This study tested the effects of personalised feedback on fat intake in a general population. Hospital workers (n = 801) were randomised to receive personalised feedback or no personalised feedback. Personalised feedback consisted of one sentence expressing current fat intake as a percentage of total calorific intake. Changes in fat intake from baseline to five months post-intervention were evaluated. The personalised intervention produced significant decreases in total and saturated fat intake, compared with the control group. Total-fat decreased by 8.6% (versus 0.2% in the control group); saturated fat decreased by 9.3% (versus 1.7% in the control group). Fat intake as a proportion of total calorific intake did not decrease significantly in either condition. Findings also revealed differential effects of feedback on high- versus low-fat consumer groups. Personalised feedback significantly reduced fat intake in high-fat consumers, and prevented low-fat consumers from increasing their fat intake. Personalised fat feedback therefore represents an efficacious and low-intensity approach to the reduction of fat intake in the general population." ],

Patients weresampled from 12 community team caseloads across threeprimary care organisations. Observations and interviewswere audio-recorded and transcribed. Iterative data analysiscomprised familiarisation, coding and categorisation usingtechniques of constant comparison to generate typologiesof concepts. The study received all necessary ethics andgovernance approvals.Results: 17 nurse/patient encounters were observed (n=11 patients, 8 nurses) with 23 post observation interviews(11 nurse, 12 patient/carer). The discussion of physicalsymptoms, especially pain, formed the core of eachobserved encounter. Nurses primarily focused on medicinesmanagement (dose, frequency, suitability), other approachesto symptom management were infrequent. Nurses wereskilled at using informal conversational assessment styles,but the non-use of formal assessment tools could narrowthe range of issues assessed. Nurses discussed the complexinterplay between physical, psychological and socialsymptoms, but this was not always reflected in care.Conclusion: Symptom management is integral tocommunity nurses work, but there is scope to improve theway this is conducted which could have a positive impacton patient outcomes." ],

Yet, there is a readiness, amongst many parents, to use baby wipes. Evidence from randomised controlled trials, of the effect of baby wipes on newborn skin integrity is lacking. We conducted a study to examine the hypothesis that the use of a specifically formulated cleansing wipe on the napkin area of newborn infants (<1 month) has an equivalent effect on skin hydration when compared with using cotton wool and water (usual care).

Healthy, term babies (n=280), recruited within 48 hours of birth, were randomly assigned to have their napkin area cleansed with an alcohol-free baby wipe (140 babies) or cotton wool and water (140 babies). Primary outcome was change in hydration from within 48 hours of birth to 4 weeks post-birth. Secondary outcomes comprised changes in trans-epidermal water loss, skin surface pH and erythema, presence of microbial skin contaminants/irritants at 4 weeks and napkin dermatitis reported by midwife at 4 weeks and mother during the 4 weeks. RESULTS: Complete hydration data were obtained for 254 (90.7 %) babies. Wipes were shown to be equivalent to water and cotton wool in terms of skin hydration (intention-to-treat analysis: wipes 65.4 (SD 12.4) vs. water 63.5 (14.2), p=0.47, 95% CI -2.5 to 4.2; per protocol analysis: wipes 64.6 (12.4) vs. water 63.6 (14.3), p=0.53, 95% CI -2.4 to 4.2). No significant differences were found in the secondary outcomes, except for maternal-reported napkin dermatitis, which was higher in the water group (p=0.025 for complete responses). CONCLUSIONS: Baby wipes had an equivalent effect on skin hydration when compared with cotton wool and water. We found no evidence of any adverse effects of using these wipes. These findings offer reassurance to parents who choose to use baby wipes and to health professionals who support their use. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN86207019." ],

  "texts" : [ "Common Motifs in Scientific Workflows: An Empirical Analysis", "While workflow technology has gained momentum in the last decade as a means for specifying and enacting compu- tational experiments in modern science, reusing and repurposing existing workflows to build new scientific experiments is still a daunting task. This is partly due to the difficulty that scientists experience when attempting to understand existing workflows, which contain several data preparation and adaptation steps in addition to the scientifically significant analysis steps. One way to tackle the understandability problem is through providing abstractions that give a high-level view of activities undertaken within workflows. As a first step towards abstractions, we report in this paper on the results of a manual analysis performed over a set of real-world scientific workflows from Taverna and Wings systems. Our analysis has resulted in a set of scientific workflow motifs that outline i) the kinds of data intensive activities that are observed in workflows (data oriented motifs), and ii) the different manners in which activities are implemented within workflows (workflow oriented motifs). These motifs can be useful to inform workflow designers on the good and bad practices for workflow development, to inform the design of automated tools for the generation of workflow abstractions, etc." ],

This idiom points to multidisciplinary nature of biophysics but what really is the biophysics? And who is the biophysicist?  Biophysics was  defined as: \"that branch of knowledge that applies the principles of physics and chemistry and the methods of mathematical analysis and computer modeling to understand how the mechanisms of biological systems work” in homepage of Biophysical Society . Biophysics may be thought of as the central circle in a two-dimensional array of overlapping circles, which include physics, chemistry, physiology, and general biology. Two wings of Biophysics are Biology and physics. Organisms are made of biomaterials, which can be studied by physical laws, since physical principles and laws hold from microscopic level to macroscopic level. Biophysicist selects a part of biological problems that are pliable to interpret by physical principles and then formulate hypotheses that can be tested by experiment2. Historically, bioluminescence can be considered among the earliest biophysical phenomena. The modern biophysics appeared by discovering of molecular structure of myoglobin and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). There is no doubt that Biophysics as a multidisciplinary science covers wide spectrum of subjects as follows: Instrumental biophysics, Radiation Biophysics and radiobiology, Structural biology, Physiological biophysics, bio-cybernetics, Membrane Biophysics, Molecular biophysics, Bioenergetics, Mathematical and theoretical biophysics and Biophysical Chemistry.

As part of that evaluation, the study documented a wide range of food insecurity indicators:\n      - 27% of area residents reported they went hungry an average of five days every month;\n      - The absence of nearby supermarkets was compounded by lower than average vehicle ownership. Further, bus lines did not correspond to market location. As a result, the lack of transportation for food buying purposes was defined by residents as a major community problem;\n      - Food prices for residents of the case study area – who spent 36% of their annual income on food – averaged $275 more per year than residents of a selected suburban area who spent 12% of their income on food;\n      - The lack of fresh quality produce illustrated the issue of nutritional deficiencies and related health and learning problems that are endemic in low income areas." ],

Demand for automated routing and scheduling was found to be influenced directly by the need to re-route drivers, and indirectly by the need, generated by customers' schedules, to operate during congested periods.

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "AN ONTOLOGICAL APPROACH FOR MONITORING AND SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS IN UNREGULATED MARKETS", "Ontologies are a key factor of Information management as they provide a common representation to any domain. Historically, finance domain has suffered from a lack of efficiency in managing vast amounts of financial data, a lack of communication and knowledge sharing between analysts. Particularly, with the growth of fraud in financial markets, cases are challenging, complex, and involve a huge volume of information. Gathering facts and evidence is often complex.  Thus, the impetus for building a financial fraud ontology arises from the continuous improvement and development of financial market surveillance systems with high analytical capabilities to capture frauds which is essential to guarantee and preserve an efficient market.This thesis proposes an ontology-based approach for financial market surveillance systems. The proposed ontology acts as a semantic representation of mining concepts from unstructured resources and other internet sources (corpus). The ontology contains a comprehensive concept system that can act as a semantically rich knowledge base for a market monitoring system. This could help fraud analysts to understand financial fraud practices, assist open investigation by managing relevant facts gathered for case investigations, providing early detection techniques of fraudulent activities, developing prevention practices, and sharing manipulation patterns from prosecuted cases with investigators and relevant users.  The usefulness of the ontology will be evaluated through three case studies, which not only help to explain how manipulation in markets works, but will also demonstrate how the ontology can be used as a framework for the extraction process and capturing information related to financial fraud, to improve the performance of surveillance systems in fraud monitoring. Given that most manipulation cases occur in the unregulated markets, this thesis uses a sample of fraud cases from the unregulated markets. On the empirical side, the thesis presents examples of novel applications of text-mining tools and data-processing components, developing off-line surveillance systems that are fully working prototypes which could train the ontology in the most recent manipulation techniques." ],

Explaining how flagship anti-poverty programmes emerged, this book provides the first comprehensive account of the global growth of social assistance transfers in developing countries. Armando Barrientos begins by focusing on the ethical and conceptual foundations of social assistance, and he discusses the justifications for assisting those in poverty. He provides a primer on poverty analysis, and introduces readers to the theory of optimal transfers. He then shifts the focus to practice, and introduces a classification of social assistance programmes to help readers understand the diversity in approaches and design in developing countries. The book concludes with an analysis of the financing and politics of the emerging institutions and of their potential to address global poverty." ],

  "texts" : [ "Alcoholic beverage preference and diet in a representative Dutch population: the Dutch national food consumption survey 2007-2010", "Background/Objectives: The habitual consumption of a specific type of alcoholic beverage may be related to the overall dietary pattern. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to investigate associations between alcoholic beverage preference and dietary intake in The Netherlands. Subjects/Methods: A total of 2100 men and women from the Dutch National Food Consumption Survey 2007–2010 were studied. A general questionnaire assessed alcoholic beverage preference and two non-consecutive 24-h dietary recalls assessed overall diet. Mean nutrient and food group intakes, and adherence to the 2006 Dutch dietary guidelines across categories of alcoholic beverage preference were compared and adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), education, smoking, physical activity, energy intake and frequency and absolute alcohol consumption. Results: Largest differences in dietary habits were detected between persons who preferred wine and those who preferred beer. Persons with a beer preference had a higher absolute intake of meat, soft drinks, margarine and snacks. In contrast, persons with a wine preference had a higher absolute consumption of healthy foods. However, after multiple adjustments, wine consumers still consumed less energy and more vegetables and fruit juices compared with beer consumers. Adherence to the Dutch dietary guidelines did not differ between preference categories after multiple adjustments. Conclusions: In this cross-sectional analysis in a representative sample of the Dutch population, a beer preference was associated with less healthy dietary behaviour, especially compared with wine preference. However, these differences were largely explained by other socio-demographic and lifestyle factors. These results suggest that alcoholic beverage preference may not be independently related to diet" ],

  "texts" : [ "La litterature et le cinema le cas de Jean Cocteau", "A poet and a movie director, Jean Cocteau brilliantly manifested surrealist inspiration in his poetry, in the performative art of his theatrical representation, and in his cinematography. His work is the best example to follow when asking the question how much the new art of cinematography inherited from other artistic expressions, especially from literature. This dissertation seeks to provide new and interdisciplinary inside into precisely those ways in which film, as an artistic expression, is intimately related to literature.\nThe thesis begins with an examination of the development of Cocteau's art from his first lyrics to his production of abstract films, showing how cinema can be directly related to his personal poetical mythology already manifested in literary works. I introduce the syncretism of Cocteau artistic expressions, examine the importance of literature in the later production of cinematography, and consider the main constructions in Cocteau's re-creation of the mythological and legendary figures of the poet. In this later endeavor I discuss myth, symbol and allegory, poetics that will be further defined in the second chapter.\nThe second part suggests that within the heterogeneous art of Cocteau, there is a profound relationship between his poetry and his films. His unique perspective goes beyond traditional genre frontiers in the lyric, in theatre, and in narrative, making for a singular representation of the very notion of artistic intuition and the role of the artist.\nWhether perceived as a form of art or an aesthetic debate, the creation of art movies become for this French poet and cineaste a perfect way to interrogate his destiny and to define his artistic personality. His visual work is populated by his literary characters and haunted by his obsession with death and sacrifice. The artistic expression he would invent by means of the cinematic image was a way, moreover, in which to attract a timeless public attention.\nAs Cocteau explored what it might mean to be a poet and the kind of destiny that a poet might secure, he raised the question of the artist's liberty, exemplifying this most fully in self-portrait we find in his re-construction of the Orpheus character in movies like The blood of the poet, Orpheus,  and The Testament of Orpheus. Creating in this way a mask for the artist's identity he also establishes an intimate link between his artistic expression in the domain of poetry and his creation in the field of dramatic representation.\nAlthough focused on the artist's ongoing concern with artistic identity, this second part of the thesis recognizes cinema as a longstanding art and analyzes its instruments and technique. Many of these are inspired by the other arts. As with literary texts cinema must attend to narrative creation, to the construction of plot and to the unfolding of character. As in theatre it involves declamation and the art of decorations. As in dance performance it relies on music, sound and animation. There are of course ways in which cinematography through special effects, for example, finds its own path as it provides a means for the poet to express his intuitive inspiration. In this Cocteau has been recognized as one of the most creative directors of all time." ],

AIMS: To compare changing patterns of suicide risk in Scotland with those in England & Wales, 1960-2008. METHOD: For Scotland and for England & Wales separately, we obtained national data on suicide counts and population estimates. Gender-specific, directly age-standardised rates were calculated. RESULTS: We identified three distinct temporal phases: 1960-1967, when suicide rates in England & Wales were initially higher than in Scotland, but then converged; 1968-1991, when male suicide rates in Scotland rose slightly faster than in England & Wales; and 1992-2008, when there was a marked divergence in national trends. Much of the recent divergence in rates is attributable to the rise in suicide among young men and deaths by hanging in Scotland. Introduction of the 'undetermined intent' category in 1968 had a significant impact on suicide statistics across Great Britain, but especially so in Scotland. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in temporal patterns in suicide risk between the countries are complex. Reversal of the divergent trends may require a change in the perception of hanging as a 'painless' method of suicide." ],

  "title" : "Characterising the Innate and Adaptive Immune Response to Intestinal Helminth infection",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Characterising the Innate and Adaptive Immune Response to Intestinal Helminth infection", "Abstract Gastrointestinal parasites are one of the most prevalent infections known to infect mammals, estimated to affect over one billion people globally. It is well established that the generation of a type two response, characterised by CD4+ T cell secretion of interleukin (IL)-13, IL-4 and IL-9 will expel most gastrointestinal helminths. Expulsion is mediated by a variety of effector mechanisms including altered mucin production, intestinal mast cell activation, increased epithelial cell turnover and increased muscle contraction. Protective immunity can be generated over time; however, infections can persist to chronicity following the modulation of a protective type two response, such as the generation of a type one response. This response, characterised by IFN-γ and IL 12 secretion, can lead to long lived infections, placing huge morbidity upon infected individuals. The mechanisms leading to the generation of a type one or type two response are not fully understood and are of paramount importance if a vaccine to helminth parasites is to be developed. In addition, the dysregulation of these responses is thought to be the cause of allergy and autoimmunity and understanding the regulation of type two responses will also add to our understanding of these diseases.Numerous labs have recently reported roles for new innate cells, such as nuocytes, as sources of IL 13, a cytokine critical to worm expulsion.  In addition, data from this lab has demonstrated that NK cell derived IL-13 is the cause of pathology during infection with Trichinella spiralis. It has also been shown that NK cells provide a supplementary source of IL-13 in Trichuris muris infected IL-4-/- mice. This thesis has used 2 strains of mice; the E4bp4-/- mouse and the Il13eGFP reporter mouse, in order to dissect the role of innate cells in the immune response to the related helminth parasites T. muris and T. spiralis. The transcription factor E4BP4 has been shown to control CD4+ T cell IL-5 and 13 secretion and the development of NK cells. Data presented in this thesis shows that following a low dose infection, which usually persists to chronicity in WT mice, E4bp4-/- mice were able to expel the parasite following the generation of an elevated type two response. This effect was abrogated following CD4+ T cell depletion, indicative of an essential role for these cells in this response. It was also shown that E4BP4 ablation was sufficient to delay expulsion of a high dose of T. muris, indicative of a key role for E4BP4 in regulating type two responses to T. muris. Contrary to the hypothesis, it was demonstrated that NK cells did not play a major role in protective immunity to T. muris.In addition, the data presented here shows, for the first time, the induction of nuocytes in the MLN following both T. muris and T. spiralis infection. Nuocytes made an early contribution to IL-13 secretion following T. spiralis infection; whereas low levels of Il13eGFP+ cells were observed only at day 18-21 post T. muris infection, with nuocytes making a less significant contribution to IL-13 levels. The levels of different cell lineages in the MLN post infection and their contribution to IL-13 expression was also mapped in detail.Finally, an analysis of the haematopoietic response in the bone marrow following T. muris infection was undertaken. The percentage and number of early progenitor Lineage-Sca-1+c-kit+ (LSK) cells in the bone marrow increased at day 21 post T. muris infection. LSK levels returned to normal after this time, indicative of an inflammation dependent response. Interestingly, E4bp4 ablation abrogated this effect, in line with the hypothesised role of IFN-γ in this expansion. Taken together, this data has added to our knowledge of the orchestration of immune responses to two intestinal helminth parasites; T. muris and T. spiralis." ],

  "texts" : [ "A Network of Multi-Tasking Proteins at the DNA Replication Fork Preserves Genome Stability", "To elucidate the network that maintains high fidelity genome replication, we have introduced two conditional mutant alleles of DNA2, an essential DNA replication gene, into each of the approximately 4,700 viable yeast deletion mutants and determined the fitness of the double mutants. Fifty-six DNA2-interacting genes were identified. Clustering analysis of genomic synthetic lethality profiles of each of 43 of the DNA2-interacting genes defines a network (consisting of 322 genes and 876 interactions) whose topology provides clues as to how replication proteins coordinate regulation and repair to protect genome integrity. The results also shed new light on the functions of the query gene DNA2, which, despite many years of study, remain controversial, especially its proposed role in Okazaki fragment processing and the nature of its in vivo substrates. Because of the multifunctional nature of virtually all proteins at the replication fork, the meaning of any single genetic interaction is inherently ambiguous. The multiplexing nature of the current studies, however, combined with follow-up supporting experiments, reveals most if not all of the unique pathways requiring Dna2p. These include not only Okazaki fragment processing and DNA repair but also chromatin dynamics." ],

  "texts" : [ "Effective Young's Modulus of Bacterial and Microfibrillated Cellulose Fibrils in Fibrous Networks", "The deformation micromechanics of bacterial cellulose (BC) and microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) networks have been investigated using Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectra of both BC and MFC networks exhibit a band initially located at similar to 1095 cm(-1). We have used the intensity of this band as a function of rotation angle of the specimens to study the cellulose fibril orientation in BC and MFC networks. We have also used the change in this peak's wavenumber position with applied tensile deformation to probe the stress-transfer behavior of these cellulosic materials. The intensity of this Raman band did not change significantly with rotation angle, indicating an in-plane 2D network of fibrils with uniform random orientation; conversely, a highly oriented flax fiber exhibited a marked change in intensity with rotation angle. Experimental data and theoretical analysis shows that the Raman band shift rate arising from deformation of networks under tension is dependent on the angles between the axis of fibrils, the strain axis, the incident laser polarization direction, and the back scattered polarization configurations. From this analysis, the effective moduli of single fibrils of BC and MFC in the networks were estimated to be in the ranges of 79-88 and 29-36 GPa, respectively. It is shown also that for the model to fit the data it is necessary to use a negative Poisson's ratio for MFC networks and BC networks. Discussion of this in-plane \"auxetic' behavior is given." ],

It addresses the traditional models of citizenship that have arisen in the national arena before turning its focus to supranational citizenship.\tThe development of quasi-citizenship rights at the European level between 1957 and 1992 are discussed whilst asking whether, in fact, these principles amounted to a de facto creation of citizenship as would be formally understood in a national model. Thereafter, post-1992 developments are considered via the activities of the European courts. The courts’ particularly activist role in expanding our understanding of Union citizenship by using existing Union legislation in imaginative ways is highlighted and used as a key factor in determining Union citizenship’s capacity to adapt and develop in the face of new challenges.\tThis thesis plays particular attention to the non-Member State nationals who reside in Union territory and find themselves ostensibly deprived of citizenship rights despite being actively involve in the Union’s activities. Supranational citizenship is viewed through the unusual lens of stateless persons and this thesis suggests that Union citizenship does not live up to its ideals by excluding them from its understanding of the citizenry. It formulates a novel conception of rights-based residence, as opposed to nationality-based, supranational citizenship that is predicated on the Union’s heritage of respect for rights and would include Member State nationals, alongside third-country nationals, the stateless and refugees (who would struggle to gain recognition under a conventional citizenship paradigm), with the aspiration of rendering Union citizenship a more inclusive and rounded conception." ],

  "texts" : [ "[[alternative]]Research for the Indicators Structure of Learning School Junior High and Elementary Schools", "[[abstract]]The purpose of this research is to construct the system for indicators weights and whose indicators content of learning school junior high and elementary schools.  To accomplish this target, Delphi technique and analytic hierarchy process were being adapted to collect, analyze and study the information.  Regarding the content, I focused on studying and discussing the development background, characteristics, relevant themes, model and composing content at the first place; then we analyzed the meaning and relevant studies of the learning schools.  I even proposed the prototype and whose content of the indicators structure of the learning schools; then I organized the questionnaire and proceeded the questionnaire survey for three stages of the prototype and whose content of the indicators structure of the learning schools based on the prototype and whose content of the indicators structure of the learning schools.  After that, I designed a questionnaire for indicators weights of learning schools according to the survey result of the Delphi questionnaire to form the indicators weights system for learning schools.           Two conclusions were found through the study and discussion of documentary, as well as the analyze and discussion of the questionnaire information in this research:           1.First degree indicators weights system for learning schools           The first degree indicators weights system mentioned in the system for indicators weights and whose index content of learning schools junior high and elementary schools constructing by my study includes the three indicators of [learning system], [knowledge management system] and [administration system].  Learning system indicators occupies the highest ratio of the total indicators weights at the rate of 43.6%.  Its purpose is to emphasize on the operation of the learning schools that individual learning, team learning, organizational learning and learning environment, the involvement and functional action must be taken into account.           The ratio distribution of the knowledge management system indicators ranks the second, occupying 32.8% of the total indicators of the learning schools.  Its purpose is to emphasize on the development of the learning schools that priorities must be put on the selection of knowledge, creation of knowledge and the establishment of knowledge storage mechanism to work with the learning system effectively to accomplish its target.  Whereas the ratio distribution of the administration system indicators occupies 23.6%, its purpose is to emphasize on the promotion of the learning schools that priorities must be put on the leadership of principal, the vision of school, the structure of school, the cooperation in administration and the organized operation of school culture to further reinforce and upgrade the efficiency of the learning schools.           2.The second grade indicators weights system and whose content of the learning schools           A. learninging system indicators           The second grade learning system index include four items of [individual learning], [team learning], [organizational learning] and [leraning environment].  Of which, [team learning] ranks the highest weights power at a rate of 36.7%, the second highest one is the [organizational learning] indicators at a rate of 31.8%, following by the [individual learning] indicators at a ratio power of 20.2%, whereas the [learning environment] occupies 11.3%.           B. Knowledge management system indicators           The second grade indices of knowledge management system includes [selection of knowledge], [creation of knowledge] and [storage of knowledge].  Among the distribution of indicators weights system, [creation of knowledge] ranks the highest at a rate of 41.3%, following by the [storage of knowledge] indicator at a rate of 30.9%, whereas [selection of knowledge] indicator ranks the last, occupying 27.8% of the knowledge management system indicators weights.           C.Administration system indicators           There are five items of [leadership of principal], [vision of school], [structure of school], [cooperation of administration] and [culture of school] under the dministration system indicators.  Of the ratio distribution for the administration system indicators weights system, [leadership of principal] ranks the highest at a rate of 29.1%, following by [vision of school] indicator at a rate of 22.6%, the succeeding one is [culture of school] indicator at a rate of 21.7%, [cooperation of administration] ranks the fourth with a rate of 16.9%, whereas the last indicator is [structure of school] with a rate of 9.7%.           Furthermore, I also propose references to educational administration authorities as well as junior high and elementary schools promoting the learning type schools, and those who intend to engage in further research according to the purpose, research result and discussion of this research.           A. Suggestion to educational administration authorities           1.Study and implement the methods to promote the learning school, supply financial aids to special project development to build a model school for learning organization.           2.By integrating the indicators weights system and content of school evaluation for learning school, it may help promote the development of learning school.           3.It is important to merge into the important things of index content of learning school so as to reinforce the review of indicator content for principal leadership to promote the development of learning schools while selecting the principals for junior high and elementary schools.           4.Promote cultivation plan for school team seed teachers to upgrade the quality of human resources in the aspect of learning system of the school.           5.The relevant staffs of the educational administration authorities should increase their understanding of the concepts and ways of the learning school so as to reinforce the promotion of learning school.           6.Educational administration authorities should stipulate autonomic extent of the school to promote the implementation of learning type school through the management of schools-based management.           B. Suggestion to junior high and elementary schools           1.Indicators weights system of the learning schools should be applied to review the present status of the existing schools, and design practical implementation plan by further using the indicators content.           2.The further study project for teachers should include the team, organizational and individual format, as well as the physical and psychological environment of learning to reinforce the operating mechanism of learning system.           3.Attend to the rebuilt cases formed by the organization after the learning system and knowledge management system are being integrated and operated.           4.The principal and the chiefs of each office should attend to the operation of administration system indicators to urge the school members to involve themselves in the practical operation of learning schools.           C. Suggestion to further research           1.Proceed the case study for the operation of indicators for learning schools.           2.Proceed the collection of substantial information to revise the indicators weights system for learning schools.           3.Proceed the establishment of quantitative index for the indicators of learning schools.           4.Proceed the research for the establishment of evaluation indicators for learning schools.           5.Proceed the research for the indicator establishment of all kinds of learning schools." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "An Audit of export services in England: developing business focused support", "<p>One of the key thresholds in the development of small and medium sized enterprises is exporting and trading internationally.  A brief review of the academic and practitioner literature highlights a number of benefits associated with exporting that include exposure to differing ways of ‘how to do’ business and opportunities for the development of joint ventures and strategic alliances.  However, several regions within the United Kingdom perceive that they have too few SMEs who trade internationally.  Recent estimates suggest that approximately three per cent of the SMEs in the United Kingdom are actively exporting (Bank of England, 1999).  Government policy makers have responded to such concerns by providing a range of support programmes to increase the number of SMEs who trade internationally and enhance the skills and capabilities of those SMEs who export, so that they can efficiently and effectively manage the exporting and market development process.</p>\n<p>Therefore, in the majority of the English regions, there are a range of publicly funded organisations providing advice, consultancy, information and training to SMEs wishing to trade internationally and those businesses already exporting.  In addition, SMEs can access a number of export services from private sector organisations such as banks, accountants, freight forwarders and export agents.</p>\n<p>There has been no overall national ‘stocktake’ or audit of such provision.  However, the need for such a stocktake is becoming increasingly important due to the introduction of a number of new support organisations into the institutional landscape and the re-organisation and re-branding of British Trade International as Trade Partners UK and the appointment of a series of Regional International Trade Directors.  The introduction of the Small Business Service will have a major impact on the coverage and nature of provision for exporting SMEs within each of the English regions.  The introduction of the Small Business Service, however, provides an opportunity to explore and examine alternative configurations of small business support and the types of organisation that are best placed to satisfy the needs of exporting SMEs.</p>\n<p>This paper presents the key findings to emerge from an audit of export services within each of the English regions. Based on a research and development project undertaken in conjunction with Trade Partners UK, the paper offers insights into:</p>\n<p>•\tThe coverage of export services available to SMEs within England;\n•\tThe effectiveness and appropriateness of current configuration of export services;\n•\tThe ways in which the effectiveness of the current configuration of export services could be enhanced. </p>\n<p>The audit was based on a series of face-to-face and telephone interviews with local, regional and national providers of export provision.  A key argument within the paper is that effective configurations of export and trade development support arise from insights into, and appropriate responses to, the exporting and trade development process as experienced by SMEs.  The paper concludes with a number of implications in terms of how business-driven forms of support can be developed.</p>" ],

  "texts" : [ "Pulmonary arterial enlargement and acute exacerbations of COPD.", "BACKGROUND: Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associated with accelerated loss of lung function and death. Identification of patients at risk for these events, particularly those requiring hospitalization, is of major importance. Severe pulmonary hypertension is an important complication of advanced COPD and predicts acute exacerbations, though pulmonary vascular abnormalities also occur early in the course of the disease. We hypothesized that a computed tomographic (CT) metric of pulmonary vascular disease (pulmonary artery enlargement, as determined by a ratio of the diameter of the pulmonary artery to the diameter of the aorta [PA:A ratio] of >1) would be associated with severe COPD exacerbations. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, observational trial that enrolled current and former smokers with COPD. We determined the association between a PA:A ratio of more than 1 and a history at enrollment of severe exacerbations requiring hospitalization and then examined the usefulness of the ratio as a predictor of these events in a longitudinal follow-up of this cohort, as well as in an external validation cohort. We used logistic-regression and zero-inflated negative binomial regression analyses and adjusted for known risk factors for exacerbation. RESULTS: Multivariate logistic-regression analysis showed a significant association between a PA:A ratio of more than 1 and a history of severe exacerbations at the time of enrollment in the trial (odds ratio, 4.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.43 to 6.65; P<0.001). A PA:A ratio of more than 1 was also independently associated with an increased risk of future severe exacerbations in both the trial cohort (odds ratio, 3.44; 95% CI, 2.78 to 4.25; P<0.001) and the external validation cohort (odds ratio, 2.80; 95% CI, 2.11 to 3.71; P<0.001). In both cohorts, among all the variables analyzed, a PA:A ratio of more than 1 had the strongest association with severe exacerbations. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary artery enlargement (a PA:A ratio of >1), as detected by CT, was associated with severe exacerbations of COPD.

However, as a scientific method employed in the study of ancient and mummified remains, it appears to have lost its popularity.This project explores the advantages and limitations of histology as a technique for such studies.  In order to do so, soft tissue and bone samples from ten early Roman Period mummies (30 BCE – 250 CE) from the Kellis 1 cemetery in the Dakhleh Oasis have been histologically examined.While this project focuses on the scientific technique of histology, and its application for the study of ancient remains, it also aims to be cross-disciplinary by incorporating scientific results from the ten mummies with the historical data and archaeological remains uncovered during excavations of the Kellis site.  By bringing the results of science and Egyptology/archaeology together, it hoped that a better understanding of ancient Egyptian society could be achieved." ],

Teachers were surveyed during the Spring of 2010. Overall findings show that most of these Arizona teachers have a great deal of faith in their ELL students' ability to achieve at grade level but that the 4 hour ELD block to which they are assigned is not helping them to catch up with their English speaking peers academically and there is deep and overwhelming concern about the segregation they are experiencing as a result of this instructional model; 85% believe this separation from English speaking peers is harmful to their learning. Most also believe that the majority of their ELL students are not meeting grade level standards and more than half of teachers also note that their ELL students are stereotyped as slow learners by other students and that the 4 hour block program is harmful to their self-esteem. The study ends with a series of recommendations including that alternative modes of instruction need to be implemented to help ELL students to succeed academically.\n      Also available at http://civilrightsproject.ucla.edu" ],

Recent investigations have revealed that the induction of LC migration following topical sensitization is dependent on tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), an epidermal cytokine. While in transit to the lymph nodes LC are subject to both phenotypic and functional maturation which, by analogy with in vitro studies, is also effected by epidermal cytokines (granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, GM-CSF and interleukin-1, IL-1). It is now apparent that Langerhans cell function, the induction of cutaneous immune responses and effective sensitization are dependent on the availability of such cytokines and that contact allergens are able to provoke their production by keratinocytes and by Langerhans cells themselves. The development of screening strategies for the evaluation of skin sensitization potential as a function of epidermal cytokine production is discussed." ],

Informally, nurses expressed general feelings of satisfaction with the programme, but some disquiet was also noted. A survey of their attitudes towards the patient activation programme was therefore undertaken. No significant differences were found between the attitudes of nurses according to grade or between experimental and control wards, but a significant difference was noted between each of the four wards when regarded as independent variables. These findings suggest the need for 'ownership' of developments in rehabilitation care." ],

In order to support increasingly data-intensive science, next generation research networks have been deployed to provide high-speed on-demand data access between collaborating institutions. In this paper, we present a practical model for online data scheduling in which data movement\noperations are scheduled in advance for end-to-end high performance transfers. In our model, data scheduler interacts with reservation managers and data transfer nodes in order to reserve available bandwidth to guarantee completion of jobs that are accepted and confirmed to satisfy preferred time constraint given by the user. Our methodology improves current systems by allowing researchers and higher level meta-schedulers to use data placement as a service where they\ncan plan ahead and reserve the scheduler time in advance for their data movement operations. We have implemented our algorithm and examined possible techniques for incorporation into current reservation frameworks. Performance measurements confirm that the proposed algorithm is efficient and scalable." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "THE EFFECTS OF CARBONATED FLUIDS ON THE HUMAN CORTICAL SWALLOWING MOTOR SYSTEM", "AbstractSwallowing is a complex neurophysiological process involving the activation of several components of the central nervous system with bilateral but asymmetric representations of swallowing musculature in the motor cortex. Difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia) in stroke patients has been reported by up to 50% of victims, and can increase morbidity and mortality in this population due to the development of aspiration pneumonia and malnutrition. One of the common factors that predispose patients to dysphagia after a stroke is believed to be the reduced sensory awareness in the oropharyngeal area, which affects the swallowing process. The uses of diet modification to reduce thin liquid aspiration have gained interest but are often unpalatable or have limited success. Carbonated liquid have shown some beneficial effects in swallowing behaviour. However, there is very little evidence to support this intervention. Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to investigate the neurophysiological and behavioural effects of carbonated liquids on swallowing in healthy volunteers.The effects of carbonated solutions on swallowing performance compared to non-carbonated solutions (still water) was investigated in a pilot study and (still water and citric acid) in the main study using reaction time task (chapter 2). Carbonation appears to alter swallowing performance compared to other liquids by improving complex tasks. In addition, beneficial neurophysiological effects of carbonated liquids were evident after 10 minutes of carbonated liquid swallowing compared to still water and citric acid solution in healthy volunteers (chapter 3).In chapter 4, the response of the healthy swallowing motor cortex to carbonated liquids following application of a virtual lesion compared to still water and saliva swallowing, was investigated. Carbonated liquids were able to reverse the inhibitory effect induced by 1 Hz rTMS to the dominant pharyngeal motor representation. Moreover, the beneficial effects of carbonated liquids on swallowing performance, measured with a swallowing reaction times task after application of a virtual lesion was observed in a pilot investigation in healthy volunteers (chapter 5). These data demonstrate that carbonated liquids have beneficial neurophysiological and swallowing performance effects and support notion that the chemical properties of carbonated liquids may provide the required peripheral sensory information that alter the brain swallowing function, which leads to an improvement in the swallowing performance of stroke dysphagic patients.  These data lay the foundation for considering the use of carbonation as facilitating stimuli in dysphagic patients." ],

  "texts" : [ "An Entrepreneurship Perspective on the  Formation and Growth of Business Groups  in the Small Business Sector", "This thesis is a contribution to our understanding of business groups in the small busi-ness sector. Specifically, its aim is to verify to what extent the consideration of entrepre-neurial processes can advance our understanding of this phenomenon. A ‘business group’ is a set of companies which are legally distinct but belong to the same person or people. Despite the significant presence of business groups in the small business sector, most of the literature on business groups addresses large groups. This study demonstrates that the available theories of business groups – the financial and the diversification theories – are not able to explain the presence and characteristics of business groups in the small business sector. Given the little work done on the issue, the research strategy involves the use of both, quantitative and qualitative methods. Quantitative methods are used to test propositions deduced from available models of business groups; qualitative methods, based on case studies and direct interviews, are used to get new insights about the phenomenon and develop theoretical propositions. Quantitative analyses refer to the population of Italian business groups; case studies and interviews refer to a sample of business groups in the Marche region (Italy). \nThe business group is an organizational form used by portfolio entrepreneurs to grow and diversify the businesses under their control. By using cross sectional and longitudinal analyses this study shows that in the small business sector diversification is a substitute strategy for growth in the original business. Moreover, this study demonstrates that the diversification theory is not able to explain the setting up of a business group as in most cases the degree of diversification observed in small groups is very low. \nThe thesis demonstrates that entrepreneurial processes associated with the exploitation of new business opportunities by portfolio entrepreneurs play a crucial role in explaining the formation and characteristics of  business groups. The start-up phase is critical for the success of a new business as it requires complete dedication of time and attention by the entrepreneur to continuously adjust the planned actions to the unforeseen events and un-predictable contingencies that are typical of this phase. The legal autonomy granted to the new venture helps focus resources and monitor results. In addition to this and more than anything else, legal autonomy allows entrepreneurs to modify the ownership structure of the new business and give minority shares to people involved in the start-up. The financial explanation of business groups stresses the importance of legal autonomy as a way for manipulating the ownership structure of new businesses, to raise outside equity. The thesis demonstrates that the causal relationship is the opposite of that hypothesised by the financial explanation: it is not so much the aim of raising outside equity that determines the involvement of external shareholders as the need to involve and motivate people in the start up of the new business that induces entrepreneurs to sell minority shares in it, thus enlarging the entrepreneurial team. By involving other people in the start-up of new ventures, portfolio entrepreneurs enhance their ability to enter new businesses while retaining ownership and control of the ones already established. The empirical analysis revealed the existence of three different patterns: joint venture with established entrepreneurs, employee involvement and intrapreneurship. The first is when new ventures are set up with other established entrepreneurs. The second is when the entrepreneur gives a share of the new company to an employee to secure his/her involvement in the start-up of a new venture (employee involvement). The third is when the new business is established as a result of the inspiration of an ‘intrapreneurial’ employee who takes major responsibility for the development of the business. As well as the discovery and analysis of these three forms, the thesis provides a theoretical explanation of entrepreneurial team development in business groups, based on the problems faced by portfolio entrepreneurs in allocating time and attention between the running of established businesses and the exploitation of new business opportunities. By integrating the latter explanation with other models of business groups the thesis provides a more general framework for understanding the formation and dynamics of business groups in the small business sector. The thesis also provides contributions to explain the formation and dynamics of entrepreneurial teams in a multi business context and in situations where there is a ‘dominant’ or ‘lead’ entrepreneur and one or more ‘associate’ or ‘sub’ entrepreneurs.\nStudying the formation and evolution of business groups poses several methodological problems, as groups are complex systems, characterised by the presence of several companies, different architectural structures and a multi-business context. The thesis provides methodological contributions on the ways to represent the current structure of business groups and on how to analyse their evolution over time." ],

  "texts" : [ "How are doctoral students supervised? Concepts of doctoral research supervision.", "<p>Literature about doctoral supervision has concentrated on describing the ever lengthening lists of functions that must be carried out. This functional approach is necessary but there has been little exploration of a different paradigm, a conceptual approach towards research supervision. This paper, based on interviews with supervisors from a range of disciplines, aims to fill this a gap. The main concepts identified are: Functional: where the issue is one of project management; enculturation: where the student is encouraged to become a member of the disciplinary community; critical thinking: where the student is encouraged to question and analyse their work; emancipation: where the student is encouraged to question and develop themselves; and developing a quality relationship: where the student is enthused, inspired and cared for. Supervisors of doctoral students are also trying to reconcile the tensions between their professional role as an academic and their personal self as well as encouraging students to move a long a path towards increasing independence. The concepts are examined in the light of each of these tensions. Finally the research illuminates the power of the supervisor’s own experience as a student and the paper suggests that supervisors need to be aware of both the positive and negative aspects of each of these conceptual approaches.</p>" ],

  "texts" : [ "INTEGRATING INDIGENOUS SKILLS AS PANACEA FOR IMPROVING VOCATIONAL AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN NIGERIA", "The paper focused on the need to integrate indigenous skills as panacea for improving Vocational and Technical Education (VTE) in secondary schools in Nigeria. The purposive population was used which comprises of teachers, students and artisans. A random sampling technique was used to select 200 respondents for the study. Descriptive survey research design was used for the study. A twenty- item questionnaire was used to elicit responses from the respondents. Standard deviation and means scores were used to analyze the data. The result shows that the integration of indigenous skills in the teaching and learning of Vocational and Technical Education will improve the quality of skills acquired in schools to a greater extent. The level of acceptability of the infusion of indigenous skills by the stakeholders is very high in the area of exposing students of VTE to practical skills and collaborative efforts. Based on the results of the study, it is recommended among others that Government should provide enabling environment for the integration of indigenous skills for improving vocational and technical education in secondary schools in Nigeria. &nbsp; KEYWORDS: Indigenous skills, Vocational and Technical Education, Collaborative efforts and Enabling Environment." ],

The goal of this project is to build an Intelligent Computer Assisted Language Learning (ICALL) system that provides computational assistance to learners of Arabic by teaching grammar, producing homework and issuing students with immediate feedback. To produce this system we use the Parasite system, which produces morphological, syntactic and semantic analysis of textual input, and extend it to provide error detection and diagnosis. The methodology we adopt  involves relaxing constraints on unification so that correct information contained in a badly formed sentence may still be used to obtain a coherent overall analysis. We look at a range of errors, drawn from experience with learners at various levels, covering word internal problems (addition of inappropriate affixes, failure to apply morphotactic rules properly) and problems with relations between words (local constraints on features, and word order problems). As feedback is an important factor in learning, we look into different types of feedback that can be used to evaluate which is  the most appropriate for the aim of our system." ],

The paper also aims at exploring the perceived impact of e-business adoption on logistics-related processes. Design/methodology/approach: Case study research, by conducting in-depth interviews in eight companies. Findings: E-business adoption is not exclusively a matter of resources. Increased e-business adoption and impact are caused by increased operational compatibility, as well as increased levels of collaboration. In terms of e-business impact this mainly refers to cycle time reductions and quality improvements, rather than direct cost reductions as reported by other authors. Research limitations/implications: The intrinsic weakness of the research method and the way concepts are operationalized limits the ability to generalize findings. Practical implications: Managers should emphasize developing their relationships with theirsuppliers/customers, in an effort to do common e-business investments, and should aim to increase their partners' commitment to the use of these applications. Originality/value: This paper provides empirical evidence from a sector where limited research efforts have taken place. Explanations can be helpful to other researchers involved in the understanding of the adoption of e-business and its impact. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited" ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "CASES ON GLOBAL E-LEARNING PRACTICES:Successes and Pitfalls", "“Cases on Global E-Learning Practices: Successes and Pitfalls” look into the global practices of e-learning which has assumed a considerable role in the education sector recently. It is edited by Ramesh C. Sharma and Sanjaya Mishra from Indira Gandhi National Open University in New Delhi, India. It is published by Information Science Publishing, which is an imprint of Idea Group, an international publishing company specializing in research publications in the fields of technology, management and information science.  The book is consisted of 356 pages (+xiv) covering 23 articles. Articles are related to successes and failures of e-learning professionals. Practical experiences and research on e-learning are provided in the form of case studies by experts from all over the world. E-learning practitioners who are involved in the design, development and implementation of e-learning may find the book quite useful since it might back up their working knowledge on how to design appropriate instructional strategies for e-learning.  The book sheds light on the potential of e-learning in instruction through reader-friendly reviews followed by unique case studies. Case study approach is deliberately assumed since case studies have the potential to present authentic learning situations with a balance of both theory and practice. Both contributors and readers are encouraged to reflect on what, when, why and how an instructional endeavor has planned, designed and implemented. Such an approach seems to initiate continuous reflective thinking on the part of the authors. Case studies in the book are presented in three sections, namely, cases on completely online learning systems, cases on blended online learning systems and cases on resource-based online learning systems each sheltering relevant articles. The introduction provides an overview of the e-learning concepts, theories and practices. It is emphasized that e-learning is a system based on technology and a new generation of distance education, which provides opportunity for both synchronous and asynchronous interaction among the stakeholders of the instruction process. The chapter also enlightens the readers in terms of the benefits of e-learning, design and development of e-learning systems and pedagogy of e-learning.  Section I: Cases on Completely Online Learning Systems Chapter 1: Online Learning with the Use of WebCT VistaIn the chapter, authors offer reflections on various aspects of the use of WebCT Vista in online business education at Marshall University, U.S. It is claimed that if adequate technology, support and the cooperation of educational administrators are sustained, WebCT Vista can improve the current educational practices remarkably. Besides, it is argued that WebCT contributes to the effectiveness of distance learning by improving students’ critical thinking, problem solving, decision making, written communication, organization and analytical skills. Students’ feedback regarding their learning outcomes is also examined which reveals that most students positively evaluated the effect of WebCT on their learning.  Chapter 2: Combining Synchronous and Asynchronous Distance Learning for Adult Training in Military Environments In the chapter, the territorial dispersion of military personnel in large geographical areas is presented as a major problem of military training. The traditional training camps require officers to gather in training camps and attend the lessons, which oblige them to leave their units. Such an approach is considered extremely costly. Thus, distance learning techniques are believed to solve such problems. A pilot study which aimed to train officers through a computer-based distance-learning system is presented along with the implementation, results and overall assessment of the study.  Chapter 3: A Case Study on Education Networks and Brokerage The chapter maintains that the educational market is influenced by the increasing importance of knowledge in society. In this respect, universities and professors need to serve existing customers better and to develop new business segments. Educational services can be delivered beyond the physical barriers of the educational institutions to a global target group through online learning systems. Besides, such an approach can transform potential competencies and marketable educational services into more profit. However, active participation of universities in the global education market is considered insufficient. Thus, several action alternatives for the German-speaking area are provided in order for public universities to transfer their core competencies to the global education market in return for more profit and global educational success. These alternatives are provided within the framework of a well-developed e-learning network example and a brokerage model among universities.  Chapter 4: Transitioning to E-Learning: Teaching the Teachers The study investigates the ongoing development of an online instructor training program initiated in 2002.

Based on the experiences of the study, administrative issues and considerations for future developments are discussed as well.  Chapter 8: The Mediated Action of Educational Reform: An Inquiry into Collaborative Online Professional Development The chapter describes and evaluates the online collaboration of four teachers in four different cities in Missouri; U.S. Teachers collaborated online to implement an online constructivist learning environment with a problem-based learning unit design. The design of the study is shaped through prior research on technology adoption innovations in the classroom, new constructivist-based learning theories and relevant principles of professional development. Methodology of cultural historical activity theory is used in order to collect and analyze relevant data to identify how effectively each teacher played their roles based on their goals for adopting the new innovations during the online collaborative professional development process. Authors successfully evaluated the effectiveness of the model and developed best-practice concepts for the online professional development programs.  Chapter 9: VIPER (Voice Internet Protocol Extended Reach): An Evaluation of an Integrated Group VoiceIP Software Application for Teaching and Learning in Higher Education The chapter suggests that recent developments such as Internet conferencing and multipoint desktop conferencing may replace text-based and audio/video conferencing software. New Internet conferencing and multipoint desktop conferencing systems are claimed to have the ability to integrate interactive tools. They are considered more advantageous in terms of the cost in comparison to audio/video conferencing software. The author assesses an exploratory study of a multipoint desktop conferencing application called Voice Café in a business school setting. The academic application of the software is named VIPER which stands for voice Internet protocol extended reach. VIPER has been evaluated through involving several undergraduate business studies students, through a dissertation support group, an MBA student group and faculty staff. The software’s features, pedagogic aspects and how faculty and students considered its use have also been discussed. General views of both students and tutors who have used the system were positive. VIPER has proved to be a useful communication tool for both students and faculty.  Chapter 10: Investigating Patterns of Cognitive and Interactive Acts in an Online Student Cooperative Program In order to improve the employability skills of university students student cooperative programs have been increasingly used. Some higher education institutions started to offer such programs online. The study explores the implementation of a pilot program at Simon Fraser University, Canada. The transition from the face-to-face to the online version of the program has been explained adequately. Development and implementation of the online version have been discussed. To address the research questions of the study, participants’ messages and focus group interviews were transcribed and analyzed. The pilot group found the online program an effective tool to support cooperation and develop employability skills. Most participants believed that the program helped them to develop several skills such as problem defining and solving, planning and goal setting, interpersonal communication, self-assessment and peer-feedback skills. Several contributive recommendations regarding the packaging of the program have been presented as well.  Section II: Cases on Blended Online Learning Systems Chapter 11: Learning Sport Management through Interaction with the Real World The chapter describes the development of a course in sport administration. Eight sport organizations provided a variety of documents including real case studies which formed the basis of the learning activities. The documents and resources are provided to students through CD-ROMs. Students both interacted online and face-to-face. It is claimed that using real world scenarios increases students’ motivation and improves the learning outcomes. Some crucial practices are recommended for practitioners who want to use case studies in their online teaching.  Chapter 12: Experimentation and Challenge: Online Criminology at the University of Bologna The chapter discusses the implementation of an online criminology course at the University of Bologna, Italy. Face-to-face lesson, online collaboration, resources available on the Internet and online and face-to-face teacher tutoring constituted the basic components of a well-designed and didactic program. Similar to other studies in the book, administrative issues and program evaluation are well-reported. Authors believe that students not only appreciated the utilitarian side of the online activity but they also become more capable of identifying e-learning’s potential to be used in their professional life. Lessons learned from the practice are invaluable and should definitely be examined by those who are interested in e-learning practices.   Chapter 13: Learning Computer Science over the Web: The ViSCoS Odyssey The chapter first maintains that most of Finland’s land consists of sparsely populated rural areas. Thus, it is difficult for institutions in these rural areas to offer advanced levels of computer science studies. In order to meet this demand, the University of Joensuu in Finland has designed an e-learning program called ViSCoS (Virtual Studies of Computer Science) for students who are interested in computer science. The program allows students to study their first-year undergraduate computer science courses through the web. More than a hundred students enrolled in the program between 2000 and 2005. The formative development method with extensive action research orientation leads to the gradual development of the program. Authors also summarize their main experiences in developing and implementing the ViSCoS courses along with invaluable recommendations for best practice.  Chapter 14: Fiji Implements Blended E-Learning as Appropriate Flexible Learning The chapter focuses on an e-learning environment which promotes and adaptive approach toward e-learning.

This review examines the kinds of understandings that have been generated through studies of primary literacy and technology reported during the period 2000-2006. It uses Green’s distinction between ‘operational’, ‘cultural’ and ‘critical’ dimensions of primary literacy (Lankshear and Bigum, 1999; Snyder, 2001) to investigate the focus and methodology of 38 empirical studies. It explores ways in which research may be informed by assumptions and practices associated with print literacy, but also highlights the kinds of studies which are beginning to investigate the implications of digital texts for primary education. The paper concludes by arguing for further ethnographic and phenomenological studies of classroom literacy practices in order to explore the complex contexts which surround and are mediated by digital texts." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Acute diarrhoea induces rectal sensitivity in women but not men.", "Some patients with diarrhoea predominant irritable bowel syndrome have increased rectal sensitivity. It is uncertain, however, whether the diarrhoea is a consequence of the rectal sensitivity or if it is sensitising the rectum in some way. The aim of this study was to assess whether inducing diarrhoea in normal healthy volunteers can sensitise the rectum and therefore be a potential or partial cause of the sensitive rectum seen in some patients with diarrhoea predominant irritable bowel syndrome. The anorectal responses to balloon distension were measured in 20 healthy volunteers (aged 20-43 years, 10 female) eight hours after laxative induced diarrhoea or under control conditions. Ingestion of an isoosmotic laxative increased stool output from 1.1 (0.7-2.3) (median (range)) to 8 (5-19) bowel movements per day with no significant differences between men and women. In women rectal sensitivity was significantly increased after diarrhoea compared with control conditions (vol to induce discomfort (ml): 116 (96, 136) v 153 (137, 168), mean (95% CI); p < 0.001). This was associated with a reduction in the volume to induce internal anal sphincter relaxation (16 (12, 20) v 28 (21, 36); p < 0.005), and volume to induce sustained internal anal sphincter relaxation (70 (56, 84) v 90 (67, 113); p < 0.03), but no significant change in rectal compliance (ml/cm H2O at 100 ml) 4.8 (3.5, 6.1) v 4.1 (3.0, 5.1) or distension induced motility (motility index) 994 (341, 1647) v 735 (46, 1424). Conversely, in men diarrhoea had no significant effect on anorectal physiology and their control values were not significantly different from those of the women. In conclusion, the results of this study taken with the finding that irritable bowel syndrome is more common in women, suggests that the male or female sex hormonal environment may be an important factor in allowing the gut to be sensitised to noxious stimuli." ],

The transcription factor RUNX1 is essential for this process, but its main downstream effectors remain largely unknown. Here, we report the identification of Gfi1 and Gfi1b as direct targets of RUNX1 and critical regulators of EHT. GFI1 and GFI1B are able to trigger, in the absence of RUNX1, the down-regulation of endothelial markers and the formation of round cells, a morphologic change characteristic of EHT. Conversely, blood progenitors in Gfi1- and Gfi1b-deficient embryos maintain the expression of endothelial genes. Moreover, those cells are not released from the yolk sac and disseminated into embryonic tissues. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a critical and specific role of the GFI1 transcription factors in the first steps of the process leading to the generation of hematopoietic progenitors from hemogenic endothelium." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Research on the Financing Problems of Taiwanese Firms Investing in Mainland China", "[[abstract]]During the process of economic development, Taiwan’s Investment in mainland China has gradually changed from traditional labor-intensive consumer industries to high-tech industries such as electronics and semi-conductor. These capital-intensive technological industries all have financing problem while making investments in China due to cross-strait policy restrictions and China’s dilapidated banking practices. China’s outdated banking industries were unable to improve their financial services to develop new product to satisfy much-needed financial demand from the fast-developing private sectors and, thus, creating financing difficulties for Taiwanese firms in China.\nThe financing sources for Taiwan subsidiaries in China are mainly from their parent companies. Taiwanese subsidiaries’ high dependence on parent company for financing forced parent company to continue to use home bank-financing which influenced unfavorably their parent-subsidiary operating financing and created worries that the problem of capital outflow into china went out of control.\nIn order to correct this problem, Taiwan subsidiary firms in China should be allowed to obtain financing or to raise fund locally to overcome the difficulties of cross-strait financing.\nTaiwan’s business communities have often criticized and recommended the Government to liberalize investment restrictions and allow Taiwan’s banking sectors to set up branch offices in China to provide financial services to Taiwanese business. China, however, still restricted Taiwanese and Foreign banks to operate local RMB financing business. After both Taiwan and China joined WTO, the problem might be corrected and national treatment on the financial industries be provided to Taiwanese as well as foreign banking industries.\nThis paper studies the financing problem of Taiwanese firms in China. Taiwanese firms’ use of home debt financing from the bank to invest in China has created high degree of worry from Taiwanese government as well as home banking communities.  As a result, Taiwan’s Central bank have asked its commercial banks to pay special attention to financing risks in China and indicated to these commercial bank to report detail account information regarding firms’ fund remittance into China.\nOn the other hand, local Chinese banks possess RMB depository resources to operate local currency guarantee loans, and become one of the ideal financing sources for Taiwanese firms. Foreign banks have the advantage in trade remittance and financing since they own branches across strait. As a result, Taiwanese firms’ financing strategy should focus on bank selection based on individual bank’s characteristics, historical background, fund-management capability, and build up firm-bank trust relationship with their debt-repayment capability to obtain local financing through private banking channels. Taiwanese firms should use portions of their operating capital to establish local banking relationship, use their long-term good will and business reputation to obtain local financing.\nWith Taiwan’s huge investment in China, Taiwan firms are scattered through out everywhere in China. These firms strive to continue their hard-working tradition and contributed significantly to cross-strait economic development. This study recommends that Taiwan government extends loan guarantee to Taiwanese firms in China and provide financial services to help Taiwanese firms to raise fund and to be listed in China’s stock market so that the financing problem may be resolved and a cross-strait win-win result may be achieved by Taiwanese firms in China." ],

Although many treatment options are available, they focus on the removal of symptoms rather than repair of the degenerate tissue. However, there is a growing interest in the potential of cell-based tissue engineering strategies for regeneration of the damaged IVD. To achieve this, investigators are now focusing on the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which offer several advantages over more mature cell types. A number of problems must be overcome for MSC-based IVD regeneration to be successful, including determining a method for the differentiation of stem cells into nucleus pulposus-like cells. Although this is still a relatively new field, it offers huge potential for the clinical treatment of IVD degeneration and LBP in the future." ],

The latter is mediated by a signal molecule called the\n\"autoinducer\". The mechanistic bases of both luminescence and autoinduction are well\nknown in V. fischeri, but this knowledge is mostly derived from studies of the cloned\nluminescence and autoinduction genes expressed in Escherichia coli. In this study,\nluminescence and autoinduction mutations were systematically generated in V. fischeri to\nexplore aspects of luminescence and autoinduction not addressable in E. coli, such as the\nadaptive significance of luminescence. Most dramatically, the mutants revealed the\npresence of multiple autoinducers and autoinducer synthases in V. fischeri. One of the\nautoinducers (autoinducer-2, or AI-2) was chemically purified and shown to be Noctanoyi-\nL-homoserine lactone. The genetic locus encoding the AI-2 synthase was\ncloned and designated ain (autoinducer). Manipulation of ain and AI-2 in V. jischeri\ndemonstrated that the function of AI-2 appears to be to inhibit rather than to promote\nautoinduction.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution December 1994The\nWHOI Ocean Ventures Fund and the WHOI Molecular Biology Fund" ],

  "texts" : [ "The yeast vacuolar membrane proteome", "Transport of solutes between the cytosol and the vacuolar lumen is of crucial importance for various functions of vacuoles, including ion homeostasis; detoxification; storage of different molecules such as amino acids, phosphate, and calcium ions; and proteolysis. To identify proteins that catalyze solute transport across the vacuolar membrane, the membrane proteome of purified Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuoles was analyzed. Subtractive proteomics was used to distinguish contaminants from true vacuolar proteins by comparing the relative abundances of proteins in pure and crude preparations. A robust statistical analysis combining enrichment ranking with the double boundary iterative group analysis revealed that 148 proteins were significantly enriched in the pure vacuolar preparations. Among these proteins were well characterized vacuolar proteins, such as the subunits of the vacuolar H+-ATPase, but also proteins that had not previously been assigned to a cellular location, many of which are likely novel vacuolar membrane transporters, e.g. for nucleosides and oligopeptides. Although the majority of contaminating proteins from other organelles were depleted from the pure vacuolar membranes, some proteins annotated to reside in other cellular locations were enriched along with the vacuolar proteins. In many cases the enrichment of these proteins is biologically relevant, and we discuss that a large group is involved in membrane fusion and protein trafficking to vacuoles and may have multiple localizations. Other proteins are degraded in vacuoles, and in some cases database annotations are likely to be incomplete or incorrect. Our work provides a wealth of information on vacuolar biology and a solid basis for further characterization of vacuolar functions. ?? 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Firm Entry and Exit with Financial Frictions", "This paper considers a model of firm dynamics to study the quantitative importance of financial frictions for the entry and exit of firms over the business cycle.  Firms face a working capital constraint in that they must pay wages and choose labor in advance.  The firm finances wages with a defaultable one-period non-contingent bond.  Financial frictions then introduce an external finance premium into the firm's cost of borrowing, which constrains the firm's demand for labor and influences the firm's entry and exit decisions through its effect on future profits.  I then measure a financial shock, which contributes to the external finance premium, from corporate bond spreads and feed it back into the model.  Under reasonable parameters, the model predicts that entry and exit rates are almost twice as sensitive to financial shocks than output and employment.  Moreover, historical financial shocks account for a third of cyclical movements in output and hours in the United States between 1953 and 2010.  They are an even stronger explanation for the first year of the Great Recession, accounting for more than half of the initial decline in output and hours, a third of the decline in entry rates and a fifth of the increase in exit rates." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Valuation of uncertainty in travel time and arrival time - some findings from a choice experiment", "We are developing a dynamic modeling framework in which we can evaluate the effects of different road pricing measures on individual choice behavior as well as on a network level. Important parts of this framework are different choice models which forecast the route, departure time and mode choice behavior of travelers under road pricing in the Netherlands. In this paper we discuss the setup of the experiment in detail and present our findings about dealing with uncertainty, travel time and schedule delays in the utility functions. To develop the desired choice models a stated choice experiment was conducted. In this experiment respondents were presented with four alternatives, which can be described as follows: Alternative A: paying for preferred travel conditions. Alternative B: adjust arrival time and pay less. Alternative C: adjust route and pay less. Alternative D: adjust mode to avoid paying charge. The four alternatives differ mainly in price, travel time, time of departure/arrival and mode and are based on the respondents’ current morning commute characteristics. The travel time in the experiment is based on the reported (by the respondent) free-flow travel time for the home-to-work trip, and the reported trip length. We calculate the level of travel time, by setting a certain part of the trip length to be in free-flow conditions and calculate a free-flow and congested part of travel time. Adding the free-flow travel time and the congested travel time makes the total minimum travel time for the trip. Minimum travel time, because to this travel time we add an uncertainty margin, creating the maximum travel time. The level of uncertainty we introduced between minimum and maximum travel time was based on the difference between the reported average and free-flow travel time. In simpler words then explained here, we told respondents that the actual travel time for this trip is unknown, but that between the minimum and maximum each travel time has an equal change of occurring. As a consequence of introducing uncertainty in travel time, the arrival time also receives the same margin. Using the data from the experiment we estimated choice models following the schedule delay framework from Vickrey (1969) and Small (1987), assigning penalties to shifts from the preferred time of departure/arrival to earlier or later times. In the models we used the minimum travel time and the expected travel time (average of minimum and maximum). Using the expected travel time incorporates already some of the uncertainty (half) in the attribute travel time, making the uncertainty attribute in the utility function not significant. The parameters values and values-of-time for using the minimum or expected travel time do not differ. Initially, we looked at schedule delays only from an arrival time perspective. Here we also distinguished between schedule delays based on the minimum arrival time and the expected arrival time (average of minimum and maximum). Again, when using expected schedule delays the uncertainty is included in the schedule delays and a separate uncertainty attribute in the utility function is not significant. There is another issue involved when looking at the preferred arrival time of the respondents; there are three cases to take into account: 1.If the minimum and maximum arrival times are both earlier than the preferred arrival time we are certain about a schedule delay early situation (based on minimum or expected schedule delays). 2.If the minimum and maximum arrival times are both later than the preferred arrival time we are certain about a schedule delay late situation (based on minimum or expected schedule delays). 3.The scheduling situation is undetermined when the preferred arrival time is between the minimum and maximum arrival time. In this case we use an expected schedule delay assuming a uniform distribution of arrival times between the minimum and maximum arrival time. Parameter values for both situations are very different and results from the minimum arrival time approach are more in line with expectations. There is a choice to take into account uncertainty in the utility function in either the expected travel time, expected schedule delays or as a separate attribute. In the paper we discuss the effects of different approaches. We extended our models to also include schedule delays based on preferred departure time. In the departure time scheduling components uncertainty is not included. Results show that the depart schedule delay late is significant and substantial, together with significant arrival schedule early and late. Further extension of the model includes taking into account the amount of flexibility in departure and arrival times for each respondent. The results will be included in this paper." ],

  "title" : "Some observations about the endogenous money theory",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Some observations about the endogenous money theory", "The endogenous money theory constitutes the core element of the post-keynesian monetary theory. The first formulation of this theory can be found in the works of Kaldor published in the 1970s. Taking these studies as a starting point, the post-keynesians elaborated two versions of the endogenous money theory which differ in their assumptions about the behaviour of the monetary authorities and the banking system, and hence offer different conclusions about the slope of the money supply curve. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the importance of the endogenous money theory using a criterion which can be defined on the basis of Keynes’s distinction between a real exchange economy and a monetary economy. As is well known, Keynes (1933a, 1933b) uses the former term to refer to an economy in which money is merely a tool to reduce the cost of exchange and whose presence does not alter the structure of the economic system, which remains substantially a barter economy. A monetary economy instead refers to an economic system in which the presence of fiat money radically changes the nature of exchange and the characteristics of the production process. Keynes (1933a, p. 410) notes that the classical economists formulated an explanation of how the real-exchange economy works, convinced that this explanation could be easily applied to a monetary economy. He believed that this conviction was unfounded and stressed the need to elaborate a ‘monetary theory of production, to supplement the real–exchange theories which we already possess’ (Keynes, 1933a, p. 411). The specification of the elements determining the non-neutrality of money is thus the key factor differentiating Keynes’s theory from the classical one.1 The criterion used to evaluate the significance of the endogenous money theory is whether it enables us to elaborate on and to broaden the explanation of the justification the nonneutrality of money formulated by Keynes. In The General Theory the reasons for the non-neutrality of money are grounded in the store of wealth function of money; the liquidity preference theory is the element on which the keynesian explanation of income fluctuation is based. The importance of the money endogeneity theory can therefore be assessed in relation to its ability to specify determinant factors for the non-neutrality of money that have not been highlighted by the liquidity preference theory; in other words, the significance of the endogenous money theory depends on its capacity to bring out elements of a monetary economy that have been overlooked in the liquidity preference theory. This paper presents the following results. First of all, it shows that the endogenous money theory makes it possible to extend the analysis of the factors accounting for the non-neutrality of money beyond what Keynes has done in The General Theory; in particular this paper argues that the theory of money endogeneity obtains this result by underlying the means of payment function of money. Second, the work shows that the money endogeneity theory gives credence to certain points developed by Keynes in some works published in 1933 and between 1937 and 1939. Third, the work emphasises that the novel aspects of the money endogeneity theory do not depend on the particular version of this theory, i.e. they do not depend on the slope of the credit supply curve. Finally, in the paper the most significant aspects of the money endogeneity theory are presented by means of a theoretical model that distinguishes clearly between the credit market and the money market. It is shown that an important element of the money endogeneity theory is that it elaborates an alternative credit theory to the neoclassical one. The paper is divided into three parts. In the first one, the most relevant aspects of the money endogeneity theory are presented starting from Kaldor’s work, and we bring out the consistency between that theory and the considerations formulated by Keynes in some writings which preceded and followed the publication of The General Theory. In the second part the two versions of the money endogeneity theory are analysed and it is noted that the debate between the supporters of these two versions risks overshadowing the innovative aspects of the money endogeneity theory that do not depend on the slope of the credit and money supply curves. Then in the third part, the aspects that distinguish a monetary economy from a real-exchange economy and that emerge because of the money endogeneity theory are described." ],

Here, we have begun efforts to upgrade the prototype polymer production system to a practical stage by using metabolically engineered Gram-positive bacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum as an endotoxin-free platform. We designed metabolic pathways in C. glutamicum to generate monomer substrates, lactyl-CoA (LA-CoA), and 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA (3HB-CoA), for the copolymerization catalyzed by the LA-polymerizing enzyme (LPE). LA-CoA was synthesized by D-lactate dehydrogenase and propionyl-CoA transferase, while 3HB-CoA was supplied by β-ketothiolase (PhaA) and NADPH-dependent acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (PhaB). The functional expression of these enzymes led to a production of P(LA-co-3HB) with high LA fractions (96.8 mol%). The omission of PhaA and PhaB from this pathway led to a further increase in LA fraction up to 99.3 mol%. The newly engineered C. glutamicum potentially serves as a food-grade and biomedically applicable platform for the production of poly(lactic acid)-like polyester." ],

This work is inflected by the new literacies approach (Lankshear and Knobel, 2006a), and here I provide an overview of the ways in which learning through participation is characterised by those adopting this and other related perspectives. I include a critical examination of the idea of ‘participatory’ culture as articulated in the field of media studies, focusing particularly on the influential work of Jenkins (2006a; 2006b). In order to draw these threads together around conceptualizations of learning, I summarise ways in which participation is described in the literature on socially-situated cognition.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of ustekinumab in patients with severe psoriasis attending 10 dermatology centres in the U.K. and Ireland. METHODS: A retrospective case-note review of 129 patients with psoriasis treated with ustekinumab. RESULTS: Baseline Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) was 22·9±10·1 (mean±SD). After 16weeks of treatment with ustekinumab PASI 75 (75% reduction in PASI) was observed in 63·0% (n=80/127) of patients, although four patients required concomitant therapy at the 16-week time point. Previous biologic use did show a small, non-significant trend towards treatment failure. A PASI 75 response was seen in 29·4% (n=5/17) of individuals weighing 90-100kg and treated with the standard 45mg ustekinumab dose compared with PASI 75 of 70·3%, 71·4%, 75·0% and 55·6% for weight groups <80, 80-90, 100-110 and >110kg, respectively (P=0·024). Ustekinumab therapy was well tolerated; serious adverse events were observed in 2·3% (n=3/129) of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Ustekinumab is a novel biologic agent for psoriasis. When used in everyday clinical practice it demonstrates high levels of short-term therapeutic efficacy with an acceptable short-term safety profile." ],

Growth rate of total fixed capital is used for total physical capital variables. In case of human capital; the share of total education expenditure in GDP, the share of total health expenditure in GDP and rate of school enrollment are used by turns. The main hypothesis is to test whether the primal factor is human capital in Turkish economic development. To test this hypothesis we use Romer’s (1990) Endogenous Technological Change Model (ETCM). The Engle-Granger two step co-integration method is used with time series.The econometric results indicate that physical and human capital accumulation affects positively Turkish economic development.

Given this industry is experiencing such widespread growth and becoming increasingly global, questions remain about how best to understand national markets, and how this affects the operation of the industry within them. One area of literature which addresses the concept of different national systems is Varieties of Capitalism which introduces the ideas of ‘institutional complementarities’ to account for co-ordination of actors within an economic system. This Working Brief provides an overview of the varieties of capitalism perspective by outlining some of its key features, the main criticisms, and alternative approaches to considering national systems of economic organisation. Overall, this Working Brief argues that the Varieties of Capitalism approach provides some insight into the ideas surrounding the comparative study of capitalist systems, however, criticisms of being too static, failing to account to regional diversity, overreliance on the firm, a distinct focus on the national, and the absence of labour from its discussions indicate that it is inherently flawed." ],

It focuses on the aspect of ‎poetic image, imagery in classical Arabic criticism. The aim is to point out the origins of the idea of poetry dependence ‎on imagery and whether there was an Aristotelian influence on the early Arabic works and critical practises in the scope ‎of studying and analysing poetic imagery.‎The issue of the influence of Greek thought in general , and the Aristotelian tradition in particular, is controversial in the ‎modern writings about the development of Arabic literary theory. J. S. Meisami notes that “the Arabic translations and ‎discussions of Aristotle affected criticism. Qudāma ibn Jaʿfar’s, Naqd al-Shiʿr, which discusses the good and bad ‎qualities of poetry according to a fourfold classification reminiscent of Aristotle, adapts Aristotelian moral categories ‎as the proper topics for madīḥ (panegyric) and hijāʾ (invective)”. On the other hand Al-Baṣῑr, for instance, claims that ‎Qudāma ibn Jaʿfar was not influenced by Aristotle’s thought in his book Naqd al-Shiʿr, and supports his claim by two ‎pieces of evidence. The first is that Qudāma’s definition of poetry followed the Qurʾān’s, which is different from ‎Aristotle’s. Secondly Qudāma’s idea that poetry is a craft indicates his debt to al-Jāḥiż.‎By following the historical order of the development of literary theory this paper will discuss the historical development ‎of the conception of imagery and the possible influence of the non-Arabic elements contributed towards developing ‎the theory of imagery in Arabic criticism. It will also discuss some unpublished material recently translated from ‎classical Arabic sources. ‎" ],

Despite the calamitous effects on human health arising from the extensive use of arsenic-enriched groundwaters in these regions, the mechanisms of arsenic release from sediments remain poorly characterized and are topics of intense international debate. We use a microscosm-based approach to investigate these mechanisms: techniques of microbiol. and mol. ecol. are used in combination with aq. and solid phase speciation anal. of arsenic. Here we show that anaerobic metal-reducing bacteria can play a key role in the mobilization of arsenic in sediments collected from a contaminated aquifer in West Bengal.

It draws mainly on the work carried out during the Clarity Project where different user-centred evaluations were run during the lifecycle of a cross-language information retrieval system. The iterative testing was not only instrumental to the development of a usable system, but it enhanced our knowledge of the potential, impact, and actual use of cross-language information retrieval technology. Indeed the role of the user evaluation was dual: by testing a specific prototype it was possible to gain a micro-view and assess the effectiveness of each component of the complex system; by cumulating the result of all the evaluations (in total 43 people were involved) it was possible to build a macro-view of how cross-language retrieval would impact on users and their tasks. By showing the richness of results that can be acquired, this paper aims at stimulating researchers into considering user-centred evaluations as a flexible, adaptable and comprehensive technique for investigating non-traditional information access systems." ],

The CD4 binding site is one such epitope against which several antibodies (e.g. b12, VRC01) have been isolated. In macaques infected with SHIV, passive immunization with these CD4-directed neutralizing antibodies fails to control the virus, but prophylactic administration is highly protective. Similarly, patients who generate neutralizing antibodies over the course of an HIV infection derive no clinical benefit from them, but eliciting such antibodies prophylactically by vaccination may prevent the virus from establishing its lethal foothold." ],

To\nthis effect, the study used a recursive dynamic CGE model. The model used an\nupdated version of 2005/06 SAM. The simulations examined to explore the impact of\nthis investment on Ethiopian economy are investment on electricity fully financed by\nforeign saving (loan), investment on electricity fully financed by domestic households\nand enterprise saving, and investment on electricity partly financed by domestic\nhousehold and enterprise saving and partly by foreign saving. We run these\nsimulations in combination with increase in TFP of industrial and service sectors.\nThe findings of the study have shown the improvement of the real GDP, output of\nindustrial and service sectors, average factor income and household income.\nHowever, the high growth of real GDP is registered when the investment on\nelectricity is fully financed by domestic household and enterprise saving and when\nthis investment is partly financed by domestic non government institutions and partly\nby foreign saving. Household consumption and consumption expenditure have raised\nmore when investment on electricity is financed by increased foreign savings.\nHowever, they have grown at negative rate when the investment is fully financed with\nincreased domestic household and enterprise saving. In general, investment on\nelectricity fully financed by foreign saving is resulted in lower growth rate of real\nGDP due to worsening of the net export and it is also expected to be repaid that\nwould increase indebtedness of the country. On the other hand, meeting this\ninvestment with domestic household and enterprise saving will be difficult. So,\nfinancing investment on electricity partly by domestic household and enterprise\nsaving and partly by foreign saving would be worthwhile." ],

  "texts" : [ "The role of religious epistemology in inter-religious dialogue", "From the dawn of civilization, a multitude of religious has developed each very complex. These great differences among religions make it difficult to find a least common denominator or to talk at length of religion in general. On the other hand, focusing on just one specific religion often causes us to ignore or underestimate some of the very broad traits that religions seem to share. The fact remains that we will make no headway into the question of what makes a specific religion a religion if we do not seek some characteristics common to all religions.\r\nReligion is usually associated with the supernatural or the divine.505 However, the notion of a supernatural realm does not occur in the non-theistic schools of Buddhism and functions in very different ways, say, in Taoism, Hinduism, and Islam. These shortcomings suggest that religion is notoriously difficult to define. To me, religion is any action taken through every aspect of our being to release us from our weakness or imperfection, and bring us closer to the divine reality. In other words, it is a human inner desire or activity to unite with an absolute being.\r\nThe examination of the intellectual dimension of religion that is, its key beliefs is most beneficial when it is guided and informed. Since epistemology is the theory of knowledge, one would therefore expect epistemological discussions of religion to concentrate on the question whether one could have knowledge of religious beliefs. Religious epistemology is simple to say that it is the epistemology of distinctively religious beliefs, but that will not be helpful in the absence of a definition of religious beliefs.\r\nPhilosophers of religion might consider the epistemology of religious belief, pondering questions about the sources and justifications of religious knowledge. Fundamental questions regarding the nature of knowledge are likely to arise in any culture. After all, everyone has some stake in distinguishing truth from error, wisdom from ignorance, and the path to knowledge from the path to ignorance. Epistemologists have discussed, in addition to the defining conditions and the sources of knowledge, the extent of human knowledge. They have asked how far human knowledge can extend. Many philosophers find it obvious that we know at least some things, if only things about personal experiences or household physical objects. Others have claimed, however, that we really have no knowledge. Such philosophers admit that people typically feel confident that they have some knowledge, but these philosophers insist that our apparent cases of knowledge are mere illusions. Many epistemologists aim not to set knowledge beyond our reach or to escape the quest for knowledge but rather to make many of our ordinary claims to knowledge more secure by explaining knowledge. They seek to explain what knowledge consists in and how we get it.506\r\nTherefore, a good deal of the task of general epistemology is to understand the nature of the various truth-relevant merits which beliefs can possess, the necessary and sufficient conditions for beliefs to possess those merits, and the virtues of mind and practice requisite and apt for their presence merits such as being reliably formed, being warranted, being entitled, being scientific, being rational, being justified and indeed being true.\r\nEpistemology in Western philosophical tradition has until recently offered a prominent definition of knowledge that analyzes knowledge into three essential components: justification, truth, and belief. According to this analysis, propositional knowledge is, by definition, justified true belief. Epistemologists typically focus on propositional knowledge. Knowledge that something is the case, as opposed to knowledge of how to do something. The content of propositional knowledge can be expressed in a proposition, that is, what is meant by a declarative sentence. Knowledge how to do something is by contrast, a skill or competence in performing a certain task. Within the last few decades, philosophers have discovers that these three conditions are not really sufficient for knowledge; something else is required. Genuine knowledge requires not only truth and belief, but also the satisfaction of the belief condition be appropriately related to the satisfaction of the truth condition. That is, on the traditional approach, genuine knowledge requires that a knower have an “adequate indication” that a believed proposition is true. The required “adequate indication”507 of truth, according to Plato, Kant, and many other philosophers, is evidence indicating that a proposition is true. These philosophers thus hold that knowledge must be based on evidence, or justifying reason.\r\nThe kind of justification crucial to knowledge is called epistemic justification. Even if knowledge requires justification, a justified belief can be false. In allowing for justified false beliefs, contemporary epistemologists endorse fallibilism about justification. Reformed epistemologists contend that belief in the existence of God can, in some circumstances, have an epistemic status high enough to render it worthy of acceptance even if it has no support from the arguments of natural theology or from any other beliefs. The views of Alston and Mavrodes are sometimes said to display an affinity with Reformed epistemology, and Nicholas Wolterstorff has made significant contributions to its development. But Plantinga has clearly been the leading contemporary advocate of this school of thought in religious epistemology. During the earlier phase of their development, Plantinga concentrated on defending the view that theistic belief can be in certain conditions, is justified or rationally held even in the absence of any propositional evidence or supporting argument.508\r\nFor the conviction that theistic belief is properly basic, foundationalists carry out a reconstructive project that would put our revised doxastic structures on foundations so firm that they could withstand rather than ignore skeptical challenges. That is, for the classical foundationlist theistic belief requires support from propositional evidence or argument if it is to be rationally or justifiably held. However, it is fairly clear that belief in God’s existence does not satisfy this criterion; it is neither self-evident nor incorrigible nor evident to the sense for humans at any time in this life.\r\nThe question of justification attracts philosophers especially in contemporary epistemology. And controversy of this question focuses on the meaning of ‘justification’ as well as on the substantive conditions of a belief’s being justified in a way appropriate to knowledge. William Alston, for instance, has introduced a non-deontological normative concept of justification that relies mainly on the notion of what is epistemically good from the view-point of maximizing truth and minimizing falsity. Alston link epistemic goodness to a belief’s being based on adequate grounds in the absence of overriding reason to the contrary. But for some epistemologists “Epistemic justification” means simply “evidential support” of certain sort.509 To say that s is epistemically justifiable to some extent for you is, on this view, just to say that s is supportable to some extent by your overall evidential reason. According to epistemologist, knowledge entails beliefs, so that I cannot know that such and such is the case unless I believe that such and such is the case.\r\nRobert Audi mentioned that knowledge arises in experience. It is constituted by conclusively justified true belief, meaning that: the believer may be justified by psychological certain of the true proposition in question and this proposition is so well-grounded as to be itself propositionally certain. And knowledge constitute by such belief may be called epistemic certainty. When we come to religious knowledge, Audi says that religious propositions are simply beyond the scope of human knowledge. But the point is why would it be thought that no religious propositions are known? The most common ground for holding this view is namely, that religious propositions, such as that God exists, cannot be known either a priori or on the basis of experience. The concept of justification or evidence would occur with the concept of belief in a more complex analysis of the concept of knowledge.510\r\nIn recent decades, questions of knowledge seem to have been marginalized by question of justification. As a matter of fact, however, epistemological discussion of religious belief, at least since the Enlightenment has tended to focus, not on the question whether religious belief has warrant, but whether it is justified. More precisely, it has tended to focus on the question whether those properties are enjoyed by theistic belief - the belief that there exists a person like the God of traditional Christianity, Judaism, and Islam: an almighty, all knowing, wholly benevolent and loving spiritual person who has created the world. The main epistemological question about religious belief, therefore, has been the question whether or not religious belief in general and theistic belief in particular is rational or rationally acceptable, or whether it is justified?\r\nIn its primary sense, rationality is a normative concept that philosophers have generally tried to characterize in such a way that, for any action, belief, or desire, if it is rational we ought to choose it. Rationality is the use of reason to reach a certain level of reasonableness or unreasonableness. Many positive characterizations of rational beliefs have been proposed by beliefs that are either self-evident or derived from self-evident beliefs by a reliable procedure and beliefs that are consistent with the overwhelming majority of one’s beliefs.511 Analytic epistemology in the twentieth century was conducted as if there were a part from truth itself - just one truth-relevant merit in beliefs, that one typically called either “justification or rationality;”512 and since there was a great deal of disagreement on the answer to that question, there was a great flowering of theories of justification, or theories of rationality.\r\nAccording to Nicholas Wolterstorff, there are a large number of distinct truth-relevant merits in beliefs, and that neither “Justification” nor “rationality”513 picks out single such merit, both are highly ambiguous terms, each picking out a number of distinct merits. Religious beliefs are formed or evoked by experience of some sort, or by believing what is said in some discourse, or by reflection on the implications of some complex of beliefs that one has previously acquired. Here, we notice that there are no rational activities to understand or justify the experience.\r\nRichard Swinburne considered the nature of actual belief. He saw how in a sense all beliefs given rise to action and must be based on evidence. But he knows that not all beliefs are rational beliefs. For him a beliefs will fail to be rational if it is based on evidence in the wrong way or if it is based on the wrong sort of evidence. According to Swinburne beliefs are rational in so far as they are based on investigation which was, in the believer’s view, adequate, and if the believer believes it to be rational. Swinburne understand by religious beliefs as about transcendent reality, including his belief about whether or not there is a God, and his beliefs about what properties God has (what God is like) and what actions he has performed.514\r\nAccording to John Hick, the issue is not whether it can be established as an item of indubitable public knowledge that God (or the divine or the Transcendent) exists, or most probably exists, but whether it is rational for those who experience some of life’s moments theistically to believe that God exists, and to proceed to conduct their lives on that basis. Hick looks at a rational belief in general way. For him “belief” can mean a proposition believed or it can be defined as an act or state of believing. The idea of evidence normally presupposes a gap between an observed fact, or body of facts, and an inferred conclusion. Therefore, our ordinary moment - to moment perceptual beliefs contradict the principle that all rational believing must be based upon adequate evidence. It is not that they are based upon inadequate evidence, but rather that the model of evidence-inference-belief does not apply here. Ordinary perceptual beliefs arise directly out of our experience, and it is entirely appropriate, proper, and rational to form these beliefs in this way. The relationship between experience and belief has been much debated in recent work in the philosophy of religion. This discussion has focused upon specifically theistic belief and Hick discusses also in these terms and his argument is that it is rational to believe in the reality of God.\r\nAlvin Plantinga argues on these manifestation-experiences that they are properly basic.515 That is to say, it is as rational for religious persons to hold these basic religious beliefs as it is for all of us to hold our basic perceptual beliefs. But, more basically, it is the biblical assumption translated into philosophical terms. According to Plantinga this experience is what justifies me in holding (the belief) that is the ground of my justification, and by extension, the ground of the belief itself. He then applies this principle to religious beliefs.\r\nIn philosophy, experience is generally what we perceive by the senses what we learn from others, or whatever comes from external sources or from inner reflection. In the sense, experience is associated with observation and experiment. Empiricism stresses that our knowledge must be based on experience, but rationalism claims that experience is a potential source of error and prefers rational certainty to mere empirical generalization. In ordinary usage, for every experience there must be something experienced that is independent of the subject of experience. But in philosophy, the relation between experience as a state of consciousness and independent objects of experience becomes a focus of debate. There are many different kinds of experiences, but it is religious experiences that interest me here.\r\nFrom the point of view of epistemology the modifications of consciousness consisting our apparently perceptual experience are of importantly different kinds. In addition to true perceptions there are misperceptions, illusions, and hallucinations. Therefore, if anyone misled by any of these forms of perceptual error, he or she is then deluded. In each case the delusion consists in a mistaken implicit belief about the cause of the experience: Applying this concept of delusion to the realm of religious experience, we have to ask whether those who assume that their experience of living in God’s presence is caused by their being in God’s presence are believing truly or are, on the contrary, under a delusion.\r\nIn modern philosophy of mind a major theme which bears on many theoretical issues, concerns the alleged privacy of an experience as an event knowable only to its possessor and the possibility of public access to that experience. There is much philosophical debate concerning precisely how perception is to be analyzed. In particular, questions are raised concerning the status of the phenomenon. But there is general agreement that in perception, objects present themselves to us in ways that enable us to know them. Similarly, in religious experience God presents himself in ways that enable us to know him and his actions. For Alston there are, it seems, important differences between ordinary perceptual or sense experience and religious experience. Sense perception is a common experience, whereas religious experience is less common, perhaps, even rare, sense perception yields a great deal of information about the world, whereas religious experience yields apparently little information about God, all humans have the capacity for sense perception, but many seem not to have the capacity for religious experience. These differences, however, do not show that religious experience has a structure unlike perception. For one thing, neither the frequency of an experience nor the amount of information it yields tells us anything about its structure.\r\nOn the other hand, the limitation of the rationalist way is that the only truths capable of being strictly proved are analytic and ultimately tautological. But we cannot by logic alone demonstrate any matter of fact and existence; these must be known through experience. For sure if nothing were given through experience in its various modes, we should never have anything to reason about. This is as true in religion as in other fields. If God exists, God is not an idea but a reality outside us, in order to be known to men and women, God must therefore become manifest in some way within their experience. This conclusion is in line with the contemporary revolt against the rationalist assumptions which have dominated much of western philosophy since the time of Descartes.516 Descartes held that we can properly be said to know only truths that are self-evident or that can be reached by logical inferences from self-evident premises.\r\nTherefore, those who stress faith and attack reason often place a great deal of emphasis on religious experience. However, religious experience is by no means a purely emotional “happening”; rather, it involves concepts and beliefs about the being that is experienced. If we tried to separate religious experiences from such concepts and beliefs - from the religious belief-system, as we shall call it - then there would be no way saying who or what is that is experienced, or of explaining what sort of difference the experience ought to make to the person who has it. However, such a religious belief system needs to be understood; at least to some degree - it is hard to see how understanding it is not going to involve the use of reason.\r\nFor Rationalisms, in order for a religious belief-system to be properly and rationally accepted, it must be possible to prove that the belief-system is true. Rationalism in this sense implies a reliance on reason, or intelligence, in deciding our beliefs and actions. The central idea of strong rationalism was stated forcefully by W. K. Clifford. According to his opinion, no religious belief-system is capable of meeting the high standard of proof that should govern all of our believing, and so a reasonable (and moral) person must do without religious beliefs. Among the objections to Christian belief, as well as to Judaic and Muslim, Characteristic of the modern intelligentsia is the objection that it is no longer rational, if ever it was, to believe that God exists. Therefore, the rational person will have to make his way in the world without supposing that there exists any God in whom he could trust.517\r\nHowever, according to Nicholas Wolterstorff, to believe in God is our fundamental human obligation. Central to Christianity, Judaism, and Islam alike is the conviction that we as human beings are called to believe in God to trust in him, to rely on him, to place our confidence in him. Central also is the conviction that only by believing in God can the deepest stirrings of the human heart be satisfied. Duty and fulfillment here coalesce. The rationality of trusting someone presupposes the rationality of believing that person exists.\r\nJohn Locke was among the first to formulate articulately the evidentialist challenge to theistic belief. Reason is reasoning for Locke, and clearly he thinks of it as one among others of our belief-forming processes. Faith is another belief-forming process. It, by contrast, consists in accepting something “as coming from God.”518 However, for Locke it still belongs to reason to judge of the truth of its being a revelation, and of the signification of the words wherein it is delivered.\r\nFor evidentialist, one’s belief that God exists is rational only if it is formed or sustained by good inference by inferring it from others of one’s beliefs, which in fact provide adequate evidence for it. But, Wolterstorff, see no reason what so ever to suppose that by the criterion offered the evidentialist challenge is tenable. He see no reason to suppose that people who hold as one of their immediate beliefs that God exists always have adequate reason to surrender that belief or ought to believe that they do. However, for him those abstract and highly general theses of evidentialism no longer look very interesting, once we regard them in the light of the criterion offered. Therefore, for him the fact that it is not rational for some person to believe that God exists does not follow that he ought to give up that belief.\r\nBut can we accept the Principle of Credulity? One problem is that whereas there is a fundamental uniformity about the way we report both ordinary perceptual experiences and the beliefs about objects of those experiences, there is quite a diversity of reports about religious experiences and the claim based on them. Person give incompatible descriptions of the Reality experienced. Therefore, where perceptions yield conflicting testimony, we must turn to other experiences and rational arguments to determine the truth of the various claims. That is, where there are different accounts, additional considerations must be introduced to help decide which, if any, of the religious experiences are veridical. Although the reports provide a prima facie ground for their acceptance, not all beliefs based on such experiences are true. Just as we at times doubt perceptual claims for good reason, we might do the same for claims based on religious experience.\r\nAccording to Hick, religion constitutes our varied human response to transcendent reality. Religious experience then is structured by religious beliefs which are implicit within religious experience. But the question is if this complex of experience and beliefs that takes place in different shapes within the different traditions, is to be regarded simply as a human creation or as our response to a transcendent reality, even if a response whose particular forms always involve the creative activity of the human imagination. Of course the problem of terminology is obvious as we see in many parts of philosophy, and without explanatory gloss none of the available descriptive labels for these two possibilities is entirely adequate.\r\nMuch of the philosophical discussion of religious diversity continues to centre on the work of John Hick.519 He is not interested in the question of what can justifiably be affirmed in the face of such diversity, rather, he is primarily concerned with the question of which justified response is most reasonable. Moreover, on this question, he leaves no doubt as to his opinion:\r\n519 See John Hick, An Interpretation of Religion: Human response to the Transcendent, (New Haven: Yale University and London: Macmillan press, 1989), 172.\r\n194\r\nreligious pluralism is by far the most plausible explanation for the pervasive religious diversity we encounter.\r\nMany Westerners will best understand the emergence of inclusivism and pluralism in terms of the history of Christianity. For most of its history, Christianity has been resolutely exclusivist. In late antiquity, it was a new religion, struggling to establish itself in the face of criticism and persecution. It is not surprising to find it making exclusive claims on behalf of its charismatic founder, Jesus of Nazareth. Of course, Christianity is not the only religion to have fostered exclusivist attitudes. In their more militant movements, Muslims have done the same. Some Jews cherish an ethnically exclusive identity as God’s chosen people, and some Hindus revere the Vedas as a source of absolute truth, Buddhists often see in the teachings of Gautama the only dharma that can liberate humans from illusion and suffering.\r\nHick has set forth a philosophically sophisticated pluralistic hypothesis that may avoid problems of this sort.520 As he sees it, each of the major religious traditions offers a path to salvation or liberation that involves a transformation of human existence from self-centeredness to reality- centeredness.\r\nReligious plurality is simply a fact. There are religious traditions that differ deeply in terms of their doctrines, practices, institutions, scriptures, experiences, and hope. According to pluralism, a single ultimate religious reality is being differently experienced and understood in all the major religious traditions; they all, as far as the philosophers can tell, offer equally effective paths to salvation or liberation.\r\nAccording to Harold Coward, Judaism is an appropriate tradition in which to begin the stay of religious pluralism and the world religions. The experience of being a minority group in other cultures, which becoming more common place for all the world religions as religious pluralism spreads, has been the norm for Judaism for countless generations. From the biblical period to the present, Judaism has had to formulate its beliefs and practices in the face of challenges from other cultures and religions. The viewpoint of the modern Jew opens the way for relations with Christianity, Islam, and perhaps Hinduism; however, Buddhism - especially Mahayana Buddhism may prove to be in a separate category. The Buddhist consciousness in which no transcendent God is recognized and the Mahayana awareness of the Divine in the\r\n520 Ibid.\r\n195\r\nsecular may be judged by the Jewish philosopher as a modern idolatry. Therefore, perhaps the most serious challenge for Judaism comes in its response to Buddhism. As long as a religion is founded on the experience of a transcendent God, Judaism seems to be able to enter into spiritual partnership with it. But if that experience does not hold true for the Buddhist - if it is not a transcendent God that is being experienced - can the Jew still embrace the Buddhist as a spiritual partner? This question has yet to be faced by Judaism.521\r\nThe relationship between Christianity and the other religions is one of the key issues in Christian self-understanding. Perhaps pluralism is so pressing a challenge because of the exclusivist missionary approaches adopted by Christianity over the past several hundred years.\r\nIn the rapidly expanding body of literature resulting from the encounter with other religions, many Christian theologians are concluding that Christian theology cannot continue to be formulated in isolation from the other religions, and that in fact future developments in Christian theology will be the direct result of serious dialogue with the other religions. Although the Churches are altering their ecclesiology so as to open the way for serious dialogue with other religions, the fundamental Christology that underlies traditional ecclesiology has not yet changed.\r\nThrough out the centuries the basic Islamic approach to other religions was to search for some fundamental structures that were harmonious with Islam but which lay hidden beneath the other religion’s deviations from true Islam: A major obstacle for understanding other religions was the lack of accurate information. However, Islam has essentially reached the truth toward which all other religions are evolving. Christianity, it seems, has also virtually reached this goal. It is possible that various nations or cultures will reach the truth in their own way. The Qur’an itself teaches that every community in every age has had its prophet. However, modern education will offer Muslims an opportunity to understand each religion in terms of its own culture, history, world view, and claims to truth. This will have an effect on Islamic self-perception.\r\nTherefore, the religious pluralism of the modern world will force Islam, finding itself in much the same position as the other traditions, to come to grips with them rather provincial\r\n521 See Harold Coward, Pluralism: Challenge to World Religions, Harold Coward, 1-12.\r\n196\r\ncharacter of some of its past views of other religions.\r\nAccording to Hinduism, there is one divine reality that manifests itself in many forms. The various religions are simply different revelations of the one divine reality. Hinduism sees itself as being a very open and tolerant religion. But because it asserts that the Vedas are the most perfect revelation of divine truth, Hinduism also sees itself as providing the criteria against which the revelations of all other religions must be tested. Nevertheless, the Hindu view that there is one Divine, which may be reached by many paths, has proven through out the centuries to be a powerful influence upon Hinduism’s interaction with the other religions.522 Therefore, the Hindu contribution to the modern challenge of religious pluralism is to encourage the inquiring spirit and devotion to truth that is larger than any individual tradition.\r\nThe Buddhist attitude to other religions has been described as “critical tolerance”523 combined with a missionary goal. Buddhism has demonstrated a remarkable degree of tolerance and flexibility throughout the course of its expansion. Unlike some other religious expansions, the spread of Buddhism has been accomplished more through the dissemination of ideas than by migration of peoples.\r\nBuddhism rejects the worship of God or gods and the performance of religious rituals as a means to release. It also rejects speculations about ultimate beginnings, especially about whether the self and the world were eternal, and a number of speculations about the ultimate state of the self in the future. The tolerant but critical attitude of the Buddha toward the plurality of religious views is shaped into a rigorous philosophic approach by the Madhyamika Buddhists. If, as the Buddha discovered, the goal of religion is compassion, then, say the Madhyamika, the biggest obstacle to realizing that goal is attachment to our own religious beliefs in such a way as to make them absolute. Based on this understanding, the Madhyamika Buddhist’s attitude towards other religions is one of openness and indeed a “missionary desire”524 to enter into dialogue.\r\nThe inherent desire to conceptualize and share religious experience is too deeply ingrained in\r\n522 Ibid., 63-80.\r\n523 See K. N. Jayatilleke, The Buddhist Attitude to Other Religions (Kandy, Sri Lanka: Buddhist Publication Society, 1975). And see also Harold Coward Pluralism: Challenge to World Religions, 81.\r\n524 See Harold Coward, Pluralism: Challenge to World Religions, 88.\r\n197\r\nhuman nature to render silence an acceptable answer. In fact the Madhyamika himself has been far from silent. His prescription of silence was only intended to apply to claims of absolute knowledge. As long as the limitation is honored, then discussion, including theological discussion, could take place.\r\nThe dialogical approach opens the way for the meeting of Christians with Jews, Muslims, and Hindus. However, the theocentric premise could become an obstacle to meaningful encounters with Buddhists and Advaita Vedantists. Therefore, an unresolved problem for all of these approaches is the Buddhist and even those with considerable exposure to Buddhism and Hinduism seem almost willfully to turn a blind eye to this problem. One possible exception might be found in Tillich’s formulation of the “god above gods” as the “ground of being.”525\r\nDialogue starts from the assumption that each religion has its absolute claims which cannot be relativized. No amount of reformulation will do away with the difference. But, by letting our theologizing be influenced by others we will be forced to greater honesty and deeper spirituality. The prerequisite for dialogue is not the harmonizing of all beliefs but the recognition that each spiritual person has a committed and absolute conviction, and that these convictions are different.\r\nTherefore, the expected outcome is not the homogenization of particular religions but the mutual deepening of spiritual experience within each particular religion, which may lead to glimpses of a common transcendent reality. This shift in perspective had the effect of drawing attention to the universal nature of religious experience in its many different traditions. In addition to turning attention away from metaphysics, rationalism, or revelation, the focus on the humanity of religion has had the effect of highlighting some of the limitations in human nature that must be taken seriously in all future religion." ],

To realise this target for nonlinear systems, this thesis brings in an assumption about the existence of a controlled invariant mani- fold and a Desired Feedforward Control (DFC) which is contained in the input to compensate the influence of disturbances. According to the approximation property of Neural Networks (NN) that any periodic signals defined in a compact set can be approximated by NN, the NN-based disturbance approximator is applied to approximate the DFC. Algorithmically, two important types of NN approximators that are Multi-layer Neural Networks (MNN) and Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNN) are presented in detail.In this thesis, a variety of nonlinear systems in standard canonical form are looked into. These forms are the output feedback form, the extended output feedback form, the decentralised output feedback form and the partial state feedback form. For these systems, four types of uncertainties are mainly considered. The first one is the disturbance that can be eliminated by the DFC. Secondly, the parameter uncertainty is taken into account. To get rid of this uncertainty, the adaptive control technique is employed for the estimation of unknown parameters, e.g. the NN gain matrix. The third one is the nonlinear uncertainty. For the case that nonlinear uncertainties are polynomials, it has a bound consisting of an unknown constant and a function of the regulated error such that this uncertainty can be also treated as the parameter uncertainty. Delay is the last type of uncertainty. Particularly, the delay is supposed to appear in output only. This uncertainty can be eliminated together with the nonlinear uncertainty. To establish the closed- loop stability, a Lyapunov-Krasovskii function is invoked. In addition, due to the requirement of the system structure or the stability analysis, some general control techniques are also involved such like the backstepping control and the high gain control.Throughout the results are illustrated by simulations." ],

In terms of both production and distribution,\r\nHollywood has traditionally dominated international markets, however, with radical\r\ninnovations in information and digital technologies and the spread of the Internet, it has\r\nbecome increasingly easier to make and distribute films around the world\r\n. Coupled with this\r\nis the ‘runaway production’ concept, whereby Hollywood productions are no longer tied to\r\nsite-specific studios and can choose to shoot and edit their (usually high-budget) movies in\r\nlocations around the globe. This has created an international market where cities, such as\r\nVancouver, Sydney, Brisbane, Prague, Cape Town, London and many more, compete for big\r\nmovie business. London has a thriving film and video sub-sector and a highly competitive\r\ninfrastructure, nurtured by a host of supporting institutions, which together create a powerful\r\ncreative network of players capable of competing at a global scale. The physical geography of\r\nthe city also matters to the film industry, not only in terms of shooting locations, but also in\r\ndetermining where to locate, pitch or exhibit the final creative product. Consequently, the\r\nlocation and interconnected value chain of producers, post-production, financiers, sales\r\nagents and distributors, cinemas and theatres, as well as the myriad of specialised and highly\r\nskilled workforce is key to the industry’s success. The co-location and clustering tendencies of\r\nindividuals and institutions located at close proximity in London and highlighted in this report\r\nare evidence of the intense social networking that characterises the industry." ],

The reasons for this weight loss are unknown, but may be due to increased energy expenditure (metabolic rate) or a reduction in energy intake. This was investigated in the present study, using a triple-transgenic (3xTgAD) mouse model of AD. Two-month-old 3xTgAD mice displayed greater food intake (17%) and body weight (34%) but no difference in metabolic rate, as compared with nontransgenic controls (non-Tg). At 12 months of age, 3xTgAD mice still consumed more food (30%), but their body weight was significantly lower (15%) than non-Tg controls. This reduction in body weight was accompanied by a significant rise in metabolic rate, indicated by greater oxygen consumption (24%) and carbon dioxide production (29%); the effects were also observed in 18-month-old 3xTgAD mice. These data demonstrate for the first time the existence of a hypermetabolic state in an experimental model of AD, but whether this can explain the weight loss observed in AD patients remains to be determined." ],

Immobilization of biomolecules leads to the formation of biomimetic substrates, improving cell response. We introduced RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) sequences on poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) film surfaces using thiol chemistry to enhance Schwann cell (SC) response. XPS elemental analysis indicated an estimate of 2-3% peptide functionalization on the PCL surface, comparable with carbodiimide chemistry. Contact angle was not remarkably reduced; hence, cell response was only affected by chemical cues on the film surface. Adhesion and proliferation of Schwann cells were enhanced after PCL modification. Particularly, RGD immobilization increased cell attachment up to 40% after 6 h of culture. It was demonstrated that SC morphology changed from round to very elongated shape when surface modification was carried out, with an increase in the length of cellular processes up to 50% after 5 days of culture. Finally RGD immobilization triggered the formation of focal adhesion related to higher cell spreading. In summary, this study provides a method for immobilization of biomolecules on PCL films to be used in peripheral nerve repair, as demonstrated by the enhanced response of Schwann cells." ],

The justification for why this may indeed be the case draws upon autopoietic theory and incorporates three main arguments. These are the market for corporate control, to a degree, already protects stakeholder interests, the market for corporate control is responsive to civil regulatory pressure, and civil regulatory pressure is an inevitable form of regulatory oversight for many market transactions in developed pluralistic societies." ],

Four groups of students, aged 14 to 15 years old, from a secondary school in the United Kingdom (UK) participated in the study. The students involved in the programme took the role of researchers investigating their peers’ perceptions of climate change using video to visually record their findings. University researchers worked collaboratively with the school students and a teacher from the school through an approach that empowered the students within the research process. Drawing from the ideas and issues raised from an initial briefing session, each group of students developed a short interview schedule to be used whilst investigating the views of their peers. Although the project was on a small scale, the data gathered from the brainstorming activity, video reports and reflective discussions provided a useful snap shot of how the participating students perceived their experience and the nature of their involvement in the research process. The research approach enabled students to take on the role of investigator when interviewing their peers and to offer a voice for both themselves and their peers. Introduction</p>" ],

We explore why and how such exercises shape and define conceptualisations of the relative strength of organisations, and what the consequences of this are likely to be. Our analysis is grounded in a conceptualisation of universities, particularly in the UK, as marketised, neo-liberal institutions for which rankings are essential to organisational transformation.

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Three essays concerning information transmission", "The first paper investigates how interest groups use private information to influence policy decisions. A primary observation is that access to the decision maker is necessary for information transmission, and in many situations, this access is not free. Furthermore, payments directed at securing access must be committed before the ultimate outcome is determined. The decision maker's welfare depends on both these monetary payments and on how much information is transmitted. He may restrict access in order to advance these potentially contradictory objectives. Only those interest groups' which commit sufficient resources will be granted access, and be in a position to influence the ultimate decision. The model is consistent with the observations that the rents generated by policy choices may not be completely dissipated, and relatively few interest groups find participation profitable. The sensitivity of the results to the specification of the decision maker's preferences and the information structure is also investigated. The second paper considers the feedback mechanism between firms' efforts to screen potential employees and the quality of the labor pool. The model displays a complementarity: where available workers are of lower quality on average, firms will optimally commit more resources to hiring only the most qualified. More stringent screening returns more under-qualified workers to the unemployed pool, which further lowers its quality. This framework allows us to consider the impact of changes in the environment, e.g., the introduction of web-based testing services which lowers the cost of screening potential employees. The final paper investigates the job-offer decisions of ranked institutions. The motivation is the academic job market, where differences in prestige between schools is well known. Firms cheaply learn something about a candidate's quality through an interview, but actually making an offer is costly in terms of opportunity cost. We show that a lower ranked firm will want to take a \"flier\" on the best candidates, even though they are the most likely to attract a better offer. When the firms can delay making offers, the lower-ranked firm prefers to wait to make offers until after the higher-ranked firm has made its offers" ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Effect of Fluorine Implantation Dose on Boron Thermal Diffusion in Silicon", "<p>This paper investigates how the thermal diffusion of boron in silicon is influenced by a high energy fluorine implant with a dose in the range 5x10(14)-2.3x10(15) cm(-2). Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS) profiles of boron marker layers are presented for different fluorine doses and compared with fluorine profiles to establish the conditions under which thermal boron diffusion is suppressed. The (SIMS) profiles show significantly reduced boron thermal diffusion above a critical F+ dose of 0.9-1.4x10(15) cm(-2). Fitting of the measured boron profiles gives suppressions of the boron thermal diffusion coefficient by factors of 1.9 and 3.7 for F+ implantation doses of 1.4x10(15) and 2.3x10(15) cm(-2), respectively. The suppression of boron thermal diffusion above the critical fluorine dose correlates with the appearance of a shallow fluorine peak on the (SIMS) profile in the vicinity of the boron marker layer. This shallow fluorine peak is present in samples with and without boron marker layers, and hence it is not due to a chemical interaction between the boron and the fluorine. Analysis of the (SIMS) profiles and cross-section Transmission Electron Microscope micrographs suggests that it is due to the trapping of fluorine at vacancy-fluorine clusters, and that the suppression of the boron thermal diffusion is due to the effect of the clusters in suppressing the interstitial concentration in the vicinity of the boron profile</p>" ],

  "title" : "Strategic interactions with competition authorities in the UK alcoholic beverages industry",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Strategic interactions with competition authorities in the UK alcoholic beverages industry", "This central question addressed by this thesis is how and to what extent firms in a mature industry can pursue a corporate growth strategy through sequential mergers and acquisitions of competitors by influencing the outcome of competition authority enquiries to their benefit. First, by either ensuring that mergers and acquisitions are not referred to the competition authorities at all or second, if they are referred, that they transact subsequently with minimal requirement for adverse remedies. The UK alcoholic beverages industry was examined in detail over the period 1969 2006 during which time there were 40 significant mergers and acquisitions, 26 of which were proposed in the UK the remaining 14 being cross-border deals in the US and/or Europe. Each of these transactions produced a rich array of quantitative and qualitative data. Discriminant analysis, a technique that has not traditionally been used in competition policy issues was applied to this data. The findings of the discriminant analysis were then tested using two case studies that examined i. the emergence of Scottish & Newcastle, the smallest of the national brewers in 1969, as the largest UK brewer and one of the largest brewers in Europe and ii. the emergence of Diageo, formed by the merger of Grand Metropolitan and Guinness in 1997 as the dominant global spirits producer with a wide portfolio of leading brands in Scotch whisky, gin, vodka and liqueurs. Both case studies combined a descriptive analysis ofthe long tenn impact of the anti-trust enquiries that shaped the two respective segments of the industry and short term event analysis' surrounding the specific mergers that created the leading firm in each industry. The case studies suggest that these two firms did influence the competition policy process to their advantage and, moreover, that this was an essential and deliberate component oftheir corporate strategy. The analysis reveals that firms were able to maximise their chances of success in furthering their growth strategy through mergers and acquisitions by i merging with and or acquiring firms in markets where they had no previous dominant share, ii exploiting the political landscape, iii pursuing 'agreed' rather than 'hostile' bids and iv presenting 'upfront' competition remedies before or during the referral process. Collectively, the analysis reveals that over a period of 35 years the UK alcoholic beverages industry was transformed from a fragmented national industry into one that is now dominated by two firms in their respective segments of international spirits and UK brewing. The success of Scottish & Newcastle and Diageo in achieving their merger and acquisition goals depended heavily on their ability to repeatedly and successfully interact with competition authorities. At the same time their major UK competitors, Allied Domecq, Bass and Whitbread were less successful at the key stages in their history in pursuing mergers and acquisitions. This led, within a matter of years to all those firms either exiting the alcoholic beverages industry completely or being subsumed into other firms." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Essays on corporate capital structure and cash holdings", "In this thesis, I examine several important aspects of firms’ financing processes in the G-5 countries consisting of France, Germany, Japan, the UK, and the US.First, I investigate the asymmetry in firms’ partial adjustments toward their target leverage, conditional on deviations from target leverage and financing gaps. Using the system Generalized Method of Moments, I show that the asymmetry in firms’ leverage adjustments are driven by differences in these factors. Firms adjust toward their target leverage faster when being over-levered and/or facing a financing deficit, a behavior in strong support of the dynamic trade-off theory of corporate leverage. Second, I examine whether firms’ choices of securities enable them to close out deviations from target leverage through asymmetric, logistic models that take into account both total costs of leverage adjustments (as proposed by the trade-off theory) and costs of adverse selection (as proposed by the pecking-order theory). The results suggest that even when firms’ choices of securities reflect their target adjustments as they allow them to move closer toward their target leverage, costs of adverse selection may still have some influence on these choices.Finally, I develop asymmetric, partial adjustment models to examine firms’ cash holdings adjustments. Consistent with the optimal cash holdings view, I find that firms have optimal levels of cash holdings and attempt to adjust toward these over time. Further, there is asymmetry in both their speeds and mechanisms of adjustments. Firms with above-target cash holdings adjust toward their targets faster than those with below-target cash holdings as their mechanisms of adjustments may involve relatively lower costs. They adjust mainly via changes in cash flows from financing and cash flows from investing while their counterparts adjust mainly via changes in cash flows from operating. I also document some evidence on the asymmetric impact of the magnitude of deviations from target cash holdings and factors which proxy for the levels of financial constraints on firms’ cash holdings adjustments and find that the impact of these proxies tends to be weaker than that of deviations from target cash holdings." ],

  "texts" : [ "A critical role for OX40 in T cell-mediated immunopathology during lung viral infection.", "Respiratory infections are the third leading cause of death worldwide. Illness is caused by pathogen replication and disruption of airway homeostasis by excessive expansion of cell numbers. One strategy to prevent lung immune-mediated damage involves reducing the cellular burden. To date, antiinflammatory strategies have affected both antigen-specific and naive immune repertoires. Here we report a novel form of immune intervention that specifically targets recently activated T cells alone. OX40 (CD134) is absent on naive T cells but up-regulated 1-2 d after antigen activation. OX40-immunoglobulin fusion proteins block the interaction of OX40 with its ligand on antigen-presenting cells and eliminate weight loss and cachexia without preventing virus clearance. Reduced proliferation and enhanced apoptosis of lung cells accompanied the improved clinical phenotype. Manipulation of this late costimulatory pathway has clear therapeutic potential for the treatment of dysregulated lung immune responses." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "A descriptive study of work-oriented programs for educationally deficient students at the secondary level in the state of Indiana", "The purpose of this study was to investigate existing work-oriented programs for the educationally deficient in the state of Indiana, to review related literature concerning such vocationally-oriented programs, and to explore the implications for future directions in program planning and implementation.The reserach was planned to answer questions pertaining to four major levels of investigation: 1) program and coordinatore identification, 2) analysis of program structure, 3) descriptive analysis of students and 4) curriculum content. An eighteen item questionnaire was devised to gather descriptive data pertaining to these four areas.The questionnaire was sent to seventy-nine Special Education Cooperatives and/or Unified Public School Systems in Indiana as identified by the Division of Special Education, Indiana Department of Public Instruction, 1974-75 school year. From the seventy-nine questionnaires mailed, sixty-six percent of the Co-ops or Single Unified Systems responded.The first level of information analyzed concerned existing or planned programs, specific program locations in the state, identifying terminology, and information concerning personnel and their certification. All Systems responding, except one, stated that they did have some type of program for educationally deficient students at the secondary level. In fifty-eight percent of the systems, Pre-Vocational Education (P.V.E.) was the term which titled the program. Anotherthirty-five percent used the more standard label of Special Education while twenty-five percent chose Work-Study. Other labels were closely associated with Vocational Education.All professional Personnel were certified teachers with twenty-seven systems reporting that their personnel held certification in the field of special education and twenty-five systems had a wide diversity of educational certification held by their personnel. One might assume that persons with certification in special education were not abundant at the time when a large majority of these programs were initiated. The title held by these professionals closely corresponded with the program title; P.V.E., Special Education, and Work-Study. Only small differences were discernible between the total number of males and females working as professionals in the programs.Level two contained information concerning program operation and length of service with the system. Finances and program management were also questioned with regard to local, state, and federal regulations. Nearly thirty-one percent of the systems reporting had some structured program for more than seven years. Most of these long term programs are operating in large metropolitian areas and are single system units. Another twenty-eight percent of the systems responding had been operating some secondary work-oriented programs between two and three years. It would appear that these more recent programs have been developed in preparation for the special education mandate or since the promulgation of the mandate in Indiana.Nearly eighty percent of the programs were financed from twelve to one hundred percent by the school corporation. Most school systems accepted between forty-three to fifty-five percent of the financial obligation. Only three systems obtained federal grants and this money was ear-marked for specific additions to an already existing program. Seventy-five percent of the systems were applying and receiving between twenty to sixty percent of their program finances from the Department of Public Instruction.Nearly one half of those responding systems were receiving aid in widely varying amounts from either Indiana Vocational Education or Indiana Department of Vocational Rehabilitation. Both Departments have criteria upon which program funding assistance can be obtained. However, these criteria seem to lack consistency among those programs which are receiving financial benefits.Level three refers to specific information concerning students who are enrolled in work-oriented programs. Seventy-five percent of the students are enrolled in these public school programs at the secondary level between three and four years. Most of the programs appear to be structured as four-year programs. The length of enrollment varied from one to six years which may mean that pupils in soem systems may continue as long as they can show progress toward meeting program goals, or that the pupils enter the program at the junior high level.The students who are enrolled in work-oriented programs tend to cluster between the chronological ages of fifteen to nineteen inclusively. Most programs adhere to State Rules and Regulations concerning intelligence quotients for students which are between 50-79. Criteria beside that of I.Q. scores were used to determine placement in some systems, suggesting that there are more complexities in dealing with handicapped children than a single test score might indicate.Much of the literature suggests that most educationally deficient persons fall into more than one classification and this data seems to support these same findings inasmuch as a number of systems checked several categories of handicaps for their students. Forty-six of the systems reported that eighty-eight percent of their students were classified as being mentally retarded. The second largest group were classified as slow learning. One assumption can be made from this evidence; these students received higher than state standards indicating retardation on intelligence tests but still required individualized programs in order to achieve academic success and enter into the employment field.Approximately eighty-two percent of the programs are operating in a regular high school facility. Less than one-third of the programs provide work-shop facilities. More than three-fourths of those systems responding place their students on jobs either within the school or in the community.Level four concerned curriculum development. More than ninety-eight percent were utilizing some type of mainstreaming technique. The courses of Home Economics, Industrial Arts, Health & Safety, Art, Music, and Physical Education proved to be the most frequently used for the integration of educationally deficient students.According to the literature available, pre-vocational education programs seem to be providing a rewarding experience for educationally deficient students at the secondary level. It is generally agreed that goals of social and vocational competencies can be enhanced by use of a work-study contact for the adolescent because such an arrangement gives real meaning to public school attendance. Work-oriented programs are structured to provide those types of educational courses and actual job training which will later prepare the student for the world of work The pre-vocational phase of the program cultivates those work habits and specific occupational skills which make it possible for the student to be gainfully employed.Research indicates that the educationally deficient student has the potential of limited academic education, vocational training, and employability. However, he lacks sufficient skills, appropriate attitudes, and self-confidence in order to maintain an economically independent and/or socially acceptable life style without supervision and guidance from other sources. Upon graduation from the work-study program, each student should be able to take his place in society on a meaningful, rewarding level, capable and willing to assume the responsibility that will be demanded of him as an adult.From the sixty-six percent of responses received, it seems evident that there has been activity in Indiana to develop work-oriented programs for educationally deficient students at the secondary level. Adequate job placement which is suited to the individual's physical and mental capacities is the final goal.On the basis of the study it is recommended that a more uniform and reliable funding system be established to support work-oriented programs, that follow-up studies on program graduates be initiated, and that both pre-service and in-service programs be developed to upgrade the competencies of professional personnel associated with work-oriented programs.Ball State UniversityMuncie, IN 47306" ],

  "texts" : [ "FAST: Towards safe and effective subcutaneous immunotherapy of persistent life-threatening food allergies.", "ABSTRACT: The FAST project (Food Allergy Specific Immunotherapy) aims at the development of safe and effective treatment of food allergies, targeting prevalent, persistent and severe allergy to fish and peach. Classical allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT), using subcutaneous injections with aqueous food extracts may be effective but has proven to be accompanied by too many anaphylactic side-effects. FAST aims to develop a safe alternative by replacing food extracts with hypoallergenic recombinant major allergens as the active ingredients of SIT. Both severe fish and peach allergy are caused by a single major allergen, parvalbumin (Cyp c 1) and lipid transfer protein (Pru p 3), respectively. Two approaches are being evaluated for achieving hypoallergenicity, i.e. site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification. The most promising hypoallergens will be produced under GMP conditions. After pre-clinical testing (toxicology testing and efficacy in mouse models), SCIT with alum-absorbed hypoallergens will be evaluated in phase I/IIa and IIb randomized double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) clinical trials, with the DBPC food challenge as primary read-out. To understand the underlying immune mechanisms in depth serological and cellular immune analyses will be performed, allowing identification of novel biomarkers for monitoring treatment efficacy. FAST aims at improving the quality of life of food allergic patients by providing a safe and effective treatment that will significantly lower their threshold for fish or peach intake, thereby decreasing their anxiety and dependence on rescue medication." ],

  "texts" : [ "Feed Forward Control of a Micro-CHP Unit and its contribution to Low Energy Housing in the UK", "This investigation has analysed the impact on energy consumption for heating and cooling in UK housing stock, from the predicted future global warming effect, up to the 2080s.  It was found that, up to the 2050s, it is likely that heating rather than cooling will remain the main source of energy use, in a pessimistic business-as-usual scenario.  Micro-CHP (domestic scale combined heat and power plant) offers a medium term low carbon solution for the replacement of heating equipment.  The operation of a micro-CHP unit in a time-of-use electricity tariff scenario for existing UK housing stock was simulated.  The investigation analysed whether electrical export earnings could be increased by the use of feed forward control in comparison to a conventional control strategy of timed operation with optimised start, without serious compromise to fuel consumption.  It has been found that the use of an auto-regressive model with exogenous input (ARX) model can adequately describe thermal characteristics of a typical house for a model based predictive controller.  It was demonstrated that export earnings could be increased significantly without additional fuel consumption by accepting dynamic heating operation within a comfort range, rather than a static setpoint value.  Compared to a conventional control strategy, overall CO2 emissions and peak network electricity demand were reduced.  This approach increased electrical export earnings without additional fuel consumption during theoretical testing and has potential for further development. These finding confirm a positive case for utilising time-of-use electricity tariffs and could contribute significantly towards increasing the productivity of micro-CHP." ],

  "texts" : [ "UNDERSTANDING DECISION-MAKING RELATING TO OUT-OF-AUTHORITY PLACEMENTS FOR PUPILS WITH AUTISTIC SPECTRUM CONDITIONS", "This study is concerned with understanding decision-making in relation to out-of-authority educational placements for pupils with an Autistic Spectrum Condition (ASC) in one Local Authority (LA).  The aims of this research were twofold.  The first was to explore what factors have the greatest impact on the decision to educate pupils with an ASC outside the local authority.  The second was to explore the perceptions of key informants about the process for deciding those placements.  The study involved examining 24 pupil cases where out-of-authority ASC placements had been agreed and interviews with case-informants contributing to those placement decisions in order to analyse their beliefs and understandings about the processes of decision-making.  The literature review highlights the limited research with regard to decision-making about pupils with Special Educational Needs (SEN) and draws examples from medical decision-making frameworks.  Data analysis showed that two factors, complexity and range of pupil need and lack of LA provision to match the needs identified had the greatest influence on the decision to educate pupils outside the local authority.  The response of the LA’s own schools, professionals and parents to those presenting needs as well as the consequent impact on the child/young person and others were recognised secondary factors.  Case-informants offered a strong impression that for the majority of these pupils successful inclusion in their own LA would require increased and more integrated services in order to meet their identified needs. Data from the qualitative interviews provides a sense of the range of informants’ experiences relating to decision-making processes and the factors determining those perceptions.  These related to whether the processes had been experienced as planned, were evidenced-based, child-focused and involved effective working with parents and other agencies.  The findings, in part, reflect government concerns about the current statutory SEN framework and the case for change as made in the recent Green Paper (DfE, 2011).  At a local level informants identified the need for a more explicit model of decision-making, ethically grounded with an emphasis for decision-making to be based on the holistic needs of the child and viewed that this would be better facilitated by having improved joint-working between services and stronger partnership engagement between the LA and parents/carers.  Clinical professional-patient shared decision-making is discussed as a potential model which might be usefully applied to better understand and develop current SEN decision making." ],

S1 nuclease protection experiments showed that transcription of actII-ORF4, the activator gene required for expression of the biosynthetic structural genes, increased dramatically during the transition from exponential to stationary phase. The increase in actII-ORF4 expression was followed by transcription of the biosynthetic structural genes actIII and actVI-ORF1, and by the production of actinorhodin. The presence of actII-RF4 on a multicopy plasmid resulted in enhanced levels of actII-ORF4 mRNA, and transcription of actIII and actinorhodin production during exponential growth, suggesting that actinorhodin synthesis in rapidly growing cultures is normally limited only by the availability of enough of the activator protein. bldA, which encodes a tRNA(UUA)(LEU) that is required for the efficient translation of a single UUA codon in the actII-ORF4 mRNA, was transcribed throughout growth. Moreover, translational fusions of the 5' end of actII-ORF4 that included the UUA codon to the ermE reporter gene demonstrated the presence of functional bldA tRNA in young, exponentially growing cultures and no increase in the efficiency of translation of UUA codons, relative to UUG codons, was observed during growth. The normal growth-phase-dependent production of actinorhodin in the liquid culture conditions used in these experiments appears to be mediated at the transcriptional level through activation of the actII-ORF4 promoter." ],

We develop a method for allocating federal and state funds to reward local governments that adopt effective travel demand management measures and reduce the need for expenditures on expanded roadway capacity. This method is applied to Sacramento using the region's travel demand models to forecast, for twenty and fifty year time horizons, the effects of two travel demand management scenarios: a congestion pricing scenario and a comprehensive scenario that includes congestion pricing, parking pricing, and a fuel tax. Estimates of the capital, operation, and maintenance costs were obtained from local data and are used in the financial analysis of cost savings. We found that in the Sacramento region travel demand management implementation could defer roadway projects for a minimum of 7 yr and a maximum of 24 yr, resulting in a total savings to federal and state agencies of least $100 million and at most $223 million in 1992 $, which could be used to make annual payments of at least $16 million or at most $31 million a year to local governments. Issues surrounding the technical and political feasibility of funding incentives to local governments are addressed and further research is suggested." ],

One member of the team is a joint school-university appointment. A former local authority consultant she now works 50% in a partnership training school where she mentors four students and 50% as a PGCE tutor contributing to all elements of the PGCE course including subject specific and professional studies sessions, tutoring a number of students including school visits.What are the affordances of a joint school-university appointment? What are the personal challenges for the appointee and colleagues working with the appointee – in school and in university?Evidence for the paper is through personal reflective accounts, and focus group discussions with school and university colleagues. There will also be an anonymous questionnaire of student teachers to find out whether the joint school-university appointee’s support is qualitatively different to that of other tutors.Becoming a teacher educator is challenging at the best of times (Berry, 2007; Swennen & van der Klink, 2009), as is establishing yourself as a teacher in a new school (Day et al. 2007). To do both at once is novel, but given current government priorities something that is likely to become more commonplace, with initiatives such as School Direct (TDA, 2011).Professional identity provides a means of interpreting the way practitioners conduct their work (Day et al, 2005) and the development needs they prioritise. In school there are priorities of learning systems and policies and establishing oneself as a member of the adult community. In higher education this often includes embarking on Masters level study as a requirement for becoming a higher education lecturer (HE academy n.d.). The outcomes of this early experience have implications for the developing practice of the University of Manchester PGCE mathematics team and the way in which university and school based colleagues work together to optimise learning for beginning teachers, as new models of ITE are adopted within a well-established partnership. These implications may provide areas for consideration by institutions rethinking partnership in initial teacher education." ],

  "texts" : [ "The ephemeral aesthetic of spontaneous design on the streets of São Paulo, Brazil", "<p>There are few opportunities when the poor and prosperous can be spoken about with respect to the same, shared cultural experience. And yet, visual culture, and the design process that contributes to its materialisation in specific contexts, offers an opportunity to recognise a socially inclusive activity that reveals similarity rather than difference. This paper celebrates an ephemeral aesthetic that is appreciated by people at different ends of the economic, political and social spectrum. A mutual appreciation for the medium of collage differs only in terms of the environment within which the recycled object is eventually revealed. This paper explores some of these different contexts, and those who recognise and practise this phenomenon in a South American and European context. The conclusion of this speculative and exploratory study is that there is potential to develop this unique medium as an accessible and inclusive visual language, giving voice to those who often do not have the opportunity or the means to speak and be heard. Collage is recognised as a channel that mediates between social exclusion and inclusion when political and economic means have been exhausted. The resulting ephemeral aesthetic is proven to have visual appeal, satisfying low- and high-order human needs.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Keywords:</strong> <br />\nBricolage; Ephemeral Aesthetic; Urban Poor; Human Need; Graphic Design</p>" ],

  "texts" : [ "Patient knowledge, perceptions, and acceptance of generic medicines: a comprehensive review of the current literature", "Alian A Alrasheedy,1 Mohamed Azmi Hassali,1 Kay Stewart,2 David CM Kong,2 Hisham Aljadhey,3 Mohamed Izham Mohamed Ibrahim,4 Saleh Karamah Al-Tamimi1 1Discipline of Social and Administrative Pharmacy, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia; 2Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; 3Medication Safety Research Chair, Clinical Pharmacy Department, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; 4College of Pharmacy, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar  Background: Generic medicines have the same quality, safety, and efficacy as their counterpart original brand medicines. Generic medicines provide the same therapeutic outcomes but at a much cheaper cost, so are promoted in many countries to contain pharmaceutical expenditure and sustain the health care system. Thus, the perspective of patients and medicine consumers as end users of these medicines is an important factor to enhance the use and utilization of generic medicines. The objective of this paper is to review patients&rsquo; and consumers&rsquo; knowledge, perceptions, acceptance, and views of generic medicines in the current literature. Methods: An extensive literature search was performed in several databases, namely Scopus, PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, Proquest, and the Wiley online library, to identify relevant studies published in the English literature for the period 1990&ndash;2013. Results: A total of 53 studies were included in the review, comprising 24 studies from Europe, ten from North America, six from Asia, five from Australia and New Zealand, five from the Middle East, one from Africa, one from Latin America, and one from the Caribbean region. A large body of literature has reported misconceptions and negative perceptions about generic medicines on the part of patients and medicine consumers. Moreover, although it is reported in almost all countries, the percentage of consumers who had such misconceptions varied from one country to another. However, in many countries, there was a meaningful percentage of patients who had negative perceptions and misconceptions about generic medicines. Moreover, such misconceptions and negative perceptions were reported as major obstacles to the use and acceptance of generic medicines among patients. Further, studies that focused on specific populations (eg, patients with epilepsy, psychosis, or renal disease) reported a more negative perception and more resistance to the use of generic medicines. The type of medical condition and its level of seriousness or severity, recommendations by health care professionals, price difference (ie, cost saving), previous experience of generic medicines, and knowledge/information about generic medicines were considered to be important factors that affect a patient&rsquo;s decision to use a generic medicine or a brand medicine. Conclusion: The results from this literature search show that patients and medicine consumers tend to prefer original brand medicines over generic medicines. Further, in many countries, there is still a considerable proportion of patients and consumers who lack adequate knowledge or have insufficient information about generic medicines. Thus, there is a need for educational interventions and activities to educate patients about generic medicines. It is also evident in the literature that health care professionals (physicians and pharmacists) play a key role in the promotion of generic medicines and in patients&rsquo; acceptance of generic medicines and generic substitution. Hence, health care professionals need to play a more active role by educating patients and recommending generic medicines to their patients.

  "texts" : [ "Cash holdings, capital structure and financial flexibility", "This thesis is structured into two main parts to investigate the role of financial flexibility in firms’ liquidity and financing management. Financial flexibility is the most important practical determinant to managers when they make financing decisions. This missing link, financial flexibility, is identified by practitioners and used in this thesis to fill the missing gap between theory and practice in corporate finance. Part A of this thesis analyses the trends in firms’ internal financial flexibility and examines the role of this internal flexibility on investment behaviour of firms. Part B of this thesis then move on to examine the role of both internal and external financial flexibility on firms’ financing behaviour.\r\n\r\nPart A examines the relationship between debt capacity and cash as part of firms’ internal financial flexibility. Firms use both debt capacity and cash holdings for their internal flexibility management; and debt capacity is used here to explain the trends observed in cash holdings. Debt capacity is the most important determinant of cash holdings and has better ability to predict cash level compared to conventional cash determinants. Together, both debt capacity and cash contribute to firms’ internal financial flexibility and are able to explain most of firms’ investment behaviour, even during a recession period.\r\n\r\nPart B examines the role of financial flexibility in capital structure decisions. Financial flexibility is measured internally as cash and debt capacity, and externally as equity liquidity using a novel external equity flexibility index based on common equity liquidity measures. The conventional pecking order and trade-off models are used to measure the impact of financial flexibility on firms’ capital structure. The pecking order theory is contingent upon firms’ internal flexibility – debt capacity. Finally, supporting the notion that financial flexibility is the most important consideration in financing decisions, debt capacity and external equity flexibility are shown to be the most important determinants of leverage." ],

  "texts" : [ "Realistic Escapism: I Romanzi della Palma and FeminineModernity in Fascist Italy", "AbstractThe object of this dissertation is the collection of translations I Romanzi della Palma,which was published in Italy by Mondadori from 1932 to 1943.The purpose of this project is to fill a gap about this underestimated series andto highlight its importance in the publishing scenario of the 1930s. In particular, I havemeant to underline how its immense success can certainly be explained by the modernmarketing techniques adopted by the publisher, but also, and most importantly, throughits innovative content. Despite being a sales-oriented product and despite hostingmostly romantic novels, IRdP disproves the assumptions about such products, byproposing texts dealing with hotly debated topics, such as female work, abortion anddivorce. It is especially the feminine models portrayed in the series that are strikinglynot in tune with the tenets of Fascist ideology about the role of women in society.Through an interesting fusion of escapist and realistic elements, and a careful balancebetween modernity and tradition, IRdP enabled many Italian readers of all social andcultural backgrounds to discover foreign models of hybrid femininity and genderrelations, and paved the way for some of the most prestigious Italian collections oftranslations.Through a scrutiny of the documents and the original IRdP novels held in theMondadori archive in Milan, and an approach that has privileged a socioanthropologicalanalysis of texts over a literary one, I have set the publication of theseries in the historical and cultural context of Fascist Italy and underlined how itinteracted with national discourses about gender and how it may have offered Italianreaders new ideas about femininity, particularly as far as agency and self-determinationare concerned. In addition, I have discussed how the publication of this series raisesinteresting questions about Fascist censorship and the regime’s ambiguous andselective relationship with modernity, and about the discrepancy between the everydayreality and the aspirations of Italian society and the Fascist project.In the first chapter, I have outlined the way in which scholarship about Fascism,about modernity and modernisation, about Fascism and culture and about femininemodels and the condition of women under Fascism have led to the argument broughtforward in this dissertation.In the second chapter, based partly on the observations made by otherscholars about IRdP and mostly on archival documents, I have contextualised thecreation of the series in Mondadori’s business strategy and in the Italian publishingcontext of the 1930s. The chapter provides a general overview of the features of theIRdP collection and particularly its interplay between tradition and modernity. I haveexplored the origins of the series and the audience it was targeting, and how athoroughly defined set of criteria determined inclusion in this series or in the otherMondadori collection Medusa.In the third chapter, I have examined the construction of national and ethnicidentities (North and South American, German, Asian and British) in IRdP, particularlywith reference to what editors deemed modern or old-fashioned in foreign femininecharacters and novels.In the fourth chapter, I have analysed the theme of work as represented inIRdP, with an overview of the condition of Italian female workers in the 1930s, Fascistpolicy and the discourses about women workers.In the fifth chapter, I have discussed the themes of relationships and family inthe collection and the extent to which the definition of gender roles in foreign texts isdifferent from what was considered acceptable in Fascist Italy." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Re-sounding Radicalism: Echo in William Blake and the Chartist Poets Ernest Jones and Gerald Massey", "This thesis argues that William Blake’s poetry creates meaning through internal poetic echoes, and that these Blakean echoes re-sound in Ernest Jones and Gerald Massey’s Poetry. There is no demonstrable link between Blake and Chartism; this raises the question of how to account for poetic echoes that occur in the absence of a direct link. The thesis uses two complementary methodological strategies. The significance of the Blakean echoes in Jones and Massey’s work will be demonstrated through extensive close textual analysis. This is accompanied by the historically focused argument that the Blakean echoes in Chartist poetry can be explained by a shared underlying cultural matrix of radical politics and radical Christianity. Chapter 1 opens by presenting the evidence against a demonstrable link between Blake and the Chartists. It outlines how the lack of a direct link impacts upon our understanding of the Blakean echoes in Chartist poetry. Existing theories of influence insufficiently describe these textual effects; this chapter draws upon aspects of Intertextuality and New Historicist theory to propose that Blake, Jones and Massey’s poetry is best considered in terms of echo, re-sounding and correspondence. Chapter 2 addresses the question of how Blakean echoes can occur in the absence of a direct link. Using recent Blake scholarship as a methodological model, this chapter outlines the ‘cultural matrix’ theory, suggesting that Blake and the Chartists engaged with many of the same radical historical ‘threads’. Chapter 3 explores key examples of Shelleyan influence in Jones and Massey’s poetry. This chapter highlights the direct intertextual link between Shelley and the Chartists and demonstrates how Chartist poetry might be discussed in terms of influence and allusion. Chapter 4 outlines the most notable Blakean echoes in the poetry of Jones. Jones’ poetry resonates with images of Priestcraft and Kingcraft, as well as chains and binding; similar images play a central role in Blake’s Songs of Innocence and Experience. The chapter contains significant engagement with Blake studies; it presents Blake’s imagery as echoingly interconnected both within and across poems and collections. Chapter 5 extends this close textual exploration to the work of Massey. Massey’s poetry contains many of the key Blakean images identified in the work of Jones. However, ‘The Three Voices’ contains an uncanny resonance of Blake; echo occurs as mis-hearing and trace. ‘Echo’ is not being used as a simple substitute for ‘allusion’, ‘influence’ or ‘intertext’, but here denotes an entirely different textual effect that must be judged in new terms. The conclusion summarises the thesis and asks whether the radical nature of Blake, Jones and Massey’s shared culture may have affected not only their vocabulary of imagery, but also the way in which these images were deployed." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Business Transfer and Retention in Rural Nebraska", "Small businesses are an important part of the economic future of rural Nebraska. Therefore, it is important for communities to be able to retain their existing businesses. Part of retaining businesses involves transferring ownership of current businesses to the next generation. How important is transferring ownership of businesses in their community to rural Nebraskans? Which strategies do they think would be most effective in retaining businesses? What do rural Nebraskans who currently own a business, farm or ranch believe will happen to it after they are no longer involved in its operation? This report details 2,841 responses to the 2002 Nebraska Rural Poll, the seventh annual effort to understand rural Nebraskans’ perceptions. Respondents were asked a series of questions about business retention and transfer strategies. Comparisons are made among different respondent subgroups, i.e., comparisons by age, occupation, region, etc. Based on these analyses, some key findings emerged:  •\t Most rural Nebraskans view assisting people to take over local businesses and farms as important to the future of their community. Ninety-two percent think assisting people to take over local businesses as current owners retire is very or somewhat important for the future of their community. Similarly, 90 percent view the transfer of local farms as important.  •\tPersons living in or near smaller communities are more likely than those living in or near the largest communities to think transferring ownership of businesses is very important. Sixty-one percent of the persons living in or near communities with populations ranging from 500 to 999 think this is very important for the future of their community. However, only 47 percent of the persons living in or near communities with populations of 10,000 or more agree.  •\t Forty-one percent of the employed respondents own either a business or farm/ranch. Twenty-one percent own a farm or ranch, 13 percent own a business and seven percent own both a farm or ranch and another type of business. Fifty-nine percent do not own either.  •\t Many rural Nebraskans are involved in multiple enterprises. Only 51 percent of the farm and ranch owners indicate that their primary occupation is farming or ranching. And, fourteen percent of the farmers or ranchers indicate that they also own some other type of business.  •\t Persons owning a farm or ranch are more likely than those owning only a business to say it will stay in their family. Forty-one percent of the persons owning only a farm or ranch state that it will stay in their family. However, only 14 percent of the persons owning only a business believe it will stay in their family.  •\t Business owners living in or near communities with populations ranging from 5,000 to 9,999 are the most likely to say their business will be sold and closed down. Thirty-five percent of the business owners living in communities of this size say their business will be sold and closed down when they are no longer involved in its operation. In comparison, 28 percent of the business owners living in communities with populations of 10,000 or more say their business will be shut down.  •\t The farm or ranch owners living in the South Central region of the state are more likely than those living in other regions to say their farm or ranch will stay in their family. Fifty-one percent of the farm or ranch owners in the South Central region state that their farm or ranch will stay in their family. However, only 24 percent of the farm or ranch owners in the Panhandle say their operation will stay in their family.  •\t The business owners in the North Central region are more likely than the business owners in other regions of the state to say their business will be sold and closed down. Forty percent of the business owners in the North Central region say their business will be sold and closed down when they are no longer involved in its operation. However, only 18 percent of the business owners in the Panhandle say their business will share this same fate.  •\tThe business retention strategies ranked the highest by rural Nebraskans in terms of their effectiveness include: creating a mentoring program for youth who are interested in becoming business owners, creating a program where people can save money that is matched with federal or other public dollars to use to start a small business, and enhancing the ability of businesses to use information technology. •\t The perceived effectiveness of several of the business retention strategies varied by community size. Providing entrepreneurial or business training to the youth in their community and educating business owners on how to develop a business plan that includes a transition plan for the business were more likely to be ranked highly by the persons living in or near the larger communities as compared to persons living in the smaller communities. Conversely, creating a revolving loan fund to be used to make loans to local businesses and creating a tax credit to use toward the development of new or existing buildings or other development costs ranked higher among the persons living in or near smaller communities than by those living in or near larger communities." ],

Current policy orthodoxy assumes there are indomitable negative costs associated with inflation; as such, Central Banks are tasked with maintain price stability to ensure economic growth and global competitiveness. Critical political economists challenge in  these assumptions tend to focus almost exclusively on the ambiguous relationships between low inflation, monetary policy and real economic growth. Examining the politics of low-inflation policy and labour market reform adds a new dimension to this critical research agenda. Using the United States and the United Kingdom as case studies, two policies designed to control inflation and adopted as part of labour market reform are examined: promoting increased product market competition and indexing wage increases to price levels using the consumer price index (CPI). These two policies reveal how controlling wage-led inflation, and all the related distributional outcomes, at the heart of low inflation policy. Finally, with inflation rates rising quickly across the US and the UK the politics of inflation have again entered the public domain. Again, we see that policy makers are looking to labour markets, not monetary policy, to quell inflationary pressures. Wage-earners must take real wage cuts to ensure a rebounding of economic growth. For all intense and purposes, it appears the politics and vigilance against wage-led inflation is paramount in Anglo-America, whether the actual inflation rate is low or high." ],

Report for the Committee on\nClimate Change.", "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY •1. Key findingsThis study examines the land use and\ngreenhouse gas implications of UK food consumption change away from carbon\nintensive products. It shows that the UK agricultural land base can support\nincreased consumption of plant-based products arising from the reduced\nconsumption of livestock products. A 50% reduction in livestock product\nconsumption reduces the area of arable and grassland required to supply UK food,\nboth in the UK and overseas. It also reduces emissions of greenhouse gases from\nprimary production by 19%. A switch from beef or sheepmeat (red meat) to pork or\npoultry (white meat) reduces food consumption related greenhouse gas emissions\nand the land area required but increases overseas arable land use. With this\nexception, the release of arable land now used to grow animal feed exceeds the\nadditional arable land required for increased plant based foods in both the UK\nand overseas. Reducing livestock product consumption also has the potential to\nenable delivery of other significant environmental benefits, for example,\nreductions in ammonia and nitrate emissions. A 50% reduction in livestock\nproduct consumption reduces UK grassland needs for UK food production by several\nmillion hectares. This land could be used to supply livestock products for\nexport markets although our scenarios assume that the proportions of imports,\ndomestic production and exports remain constant. In these circumstances, some of\nthe grassland released could be used to produce arable crops, including crops\nfor biofuel production. Almost all of it could be converted to woodland or\nmanaged in other ways for biodiversity and/or amenity purposes. Conversion of\nthis land resource to woodland has significant potential to increase soil carbon\nstorage while supplying biomass for energy.

The area of land needed to supply UK food and the\ngreenhouse gas emissions from food production under current circumstances and\nunder the seven scenarios studied. In a reduction scenario, concentrating\nremaining livestock production on different land types (e.g. concentrating on\nintensive production on lowland farms versus extensive production on lower\nquality land) has little effect on greenhouse gas emissions from primary\nproduction. This indicates that there is relatively little scope to reduce\nemissions by restructuring production (at least restructuring in relation to\nland use). It is further noted that concentrating livestock production on higher\nquality land would cause an almost complete closure of production for UK markets\non land not suited to intensive grass or arable production, with biodiversity\nand economic impacts (discussed further below). The risks of unintended\nconsequences with respect to greenhouse gas emissions are relatively low given\nthe assumptions in the scenarios, but the actuality of such change will depend\non future economic, social and political drivers. The report includes detailed\nanalyses of land use and emissions data together with extensive discussion of a\nwide range of effects based on literature analysis. •2. Study objectivesThis\nstudy was conducted for the UK Government's Committee on Climate Change (CCC) to\nexamine if UK agriculture can support consumption change away from carbon-\nintensive food products. For the purposes of the consumption scenarios, it is\nassumed the relationships between imports, exports and domestic consumption\nremain constant for each of the commodities used by the UK food system. The\nfollowing questions were addressed: 1. Land needs: Given land quality\nconsiderations (e.g. land capability and constraints), to what extent is it\npossible to support a change in the UK consumption of meat and dairy products\nwith a corresponding increase in substitute goods from UK agricultural land? Can\na reduction in meat and dairy product consumption release land for other\npurposes? To what use would this freed-up land be suitable (e.g. food\nproduction, biomass production, carbon sequestration, other ecosystem service\nprovision, forestry, etc.)? 2. Greenhouse gas emissions: What are the\nimplications of the transition in production for GHGs both in the UK and abroad\n(including soil carbon releases, sequestration, reduced production of feed, etc,\nas well as reductions in direct N2O and CH4 emissions? 3. Other effects: What\nare the other implications, including for water, other pollutants, farm incomes,\navailability of manure as a fertiliser input, public health, ecosystem services,\nbiodiversity, and animal welfare? 4. International implications: If UK\nagricultural land cannot support consumption changes, what are the international\nimplications in terms of agricultural production and land-use displacement (e.g.\ndeforestation, land for biofuels, land for food), and GHGs?•3. MethodsWe\ndeveloped and used a combination of consumption and production scenarios to\nexamine potential consequences of change. Life-cycle assessment (mainly life\ncycle inventory analysis) was applied to these scenarios to examine the overall\neffects of the consumption change on GHG and other emissions from primary\nproduction, in the UK and overseas. The production under the various scenarios\nwas allocated to agricultural land resources by a combination of survey-based\ndata analysis and model-derived calculations. Land use change (LUC) emissions\n(from changing soil C and biomass stocks) were calculated from data in the UK\nnational inventory as well as from the UK Renewable Fuel Agency for overseas\nland types. Commodity flows as affected by consumption were calculated from\nFAOSTAT and Defra data. The resulting emissions were allocated to the various\ninventories in which they are registered, e.g. the UK's GHG inventories for\nagriculture, LUC, energy use and industry, together with those from overseas\nthat are made up by components from our UK consumption of food and drink.\nScientific literature relevant to the wider assessment of these scenarios was\nanalysed (and an ecosystems services method was applied) to enable a qualitative\nassessment to complement the quantitative analysis. ScenariosWe designed a range\nof consumption and production scenarios to examine options on both the demand\nand supply sides. These comprise three consumption and three production\nscenarios. The consumption scenarios are as follows: Consumption Scenario 1. A\n50% reduction in livestock product consumption balanced by increases in plant\ncommodities. Consumption Scenario 2. A shift from red meat (beef and lamb) to\nwhite meat (pork and poultry). Red meat consumption is reduced by 75%.\nConsumption Scenario 3. A 50% reduction in white meat consumption balanced by\nincreases in plant commodities. It must be stressed that the nature of scenarios\nis such that they contain a variety of assumptions about possible future demands\nand supplies of agricultural commodities. The scenarios are not forecasts. The\nfocus has been on the technical capacity of land and agricultural production,\nnot on the market changes needed to enable change. It should be noted that the\nbalance of supply from the UK and overseas is assumed to remain as it is now.\nThe 50% reduction in livestock products was not applied uniformly across these\ncommodities. Under the reduction scenario (Consumption scenario 1), consumption\nof milk and eggs is 60% of current consumption, and meat consumption is 36% of\ncurrent consumption. Sugar consumption is also reduced to align with healthy\neating guidelines. Reduction in consumption of livestock products is balanced by\nincreasing plant consumption on the basis of constant food energy supplied.\nFruit and vegetable consumption was increased by 50% and basic carbohydrate\n(e.g. cereals, potatoes) and oil rich commodities (except palm oil) by 33%.\nSubstitution was estimated on the basis of food energy use at the commodity\nlevel using FAOSTAT data. Expert opinion was obtained in relation to the\nviability of consumption change under Scenario 1. This indicated that diets at\nthe consumer level under this scenario are viable from a nutritional viewpoint.\nIt was also noted that Consumption Scenario 1 aligns with healthy eating\nguidelines in other countries. The production scenarios are focused on the\nintensity of use of different types of land. The result is a difference in the\nquantity and type of land ‘released' from production from change that reduces\nland needs. The production scenarios are: Production Scenario 1. Uniform land\nrelease - ‘pro-rata' changes in land requirements across land types. Production\nScenario 2. Maximise release of tillable land - ruminant meat production\nconcentrated on lower quality land. Production Scenario 3. Maximise release of\nlow quality land - ruminant meat production concentrated on high quality land.\nThe combination of consumption scenarios 1 and 2 and three production scenarios\ngives a total of 6 system scenarios. These are complemented by Consumption\nScenario 3 giving a total of 7. •4. ResultsLand needsAll consumption change\nscenarios reduce the total amount of land estimated as required to support the\nUK food system. A switch from red to white meat increases the need for overseas\narable land, although a larger area of UK land that can be tilled is released.\nUnder a reduction scenario, the amount of extra land required for the direct\nconsumption of plant products is less than the amount of arable land released\nfrom livestock feed production. The net effect on total overseas arable land\nneeds is a reduction of about 311,000 ha and a net release of about 265,000 ha\narable land in the UK. The need for grassland is greatly reduced. The release of\ngrassland with some arable potential ranges between 1.6 to 3.7 million ha\ndepending on where remaining production is concentrated. The release of\ngrassland with no arable potential ranges from 0.7 to 6.9 million ha. Under a\nreduction scenario, concentrating remaining production on better quality land\nwould almost entirely eliminate sheep and beef production for the UK from the\nhills, most uplands and less productive lowland areas. Under Consumption\nScenario 2 (a shift from beef and sheepmeat to white meat from pigs and\npoultry), the diet needs of pigs and poultry result in a net increase in demand\nfor overseas grown crops, although considerably more potentially arable land is\nreleased in the UK. More arable cropping is needed both in the UK (an additional\n55,000 ha) and to a much greater extent overseas (about an additional 466,000\nha), driven largely by soy. However, the release of arable quality grassland in\nthe UK exceeds the increase in overseas arable landed needed for producing this\nfeed. The result is a net release of between 1.6 and 2.9million ha potentially\narable land in the UK plus the release of 1.3 to 6.6 millionha of land suitable\nonly for grassland. Under Consumption Scenario 3 (a 50% reduction in white meat\nconsumption balanced by an increase in plant products) the changes are much less\ncomplex with no changes in grassland needs. Increases in demand for arable land\nfor direct human consumption amounted to about 154,000 and 172,000 ha (domestic\nand overseas respectively), but these are more than compensated for by the\nrelease of arable land from feed production (341,000 and 668,000ha domestic and\noverseas respectively). Focusing a reduced cattle and sheep industry on non-\narable land would result in the release of substantially more tillable land\n(currently grassland). In a 50% livestock production consumption reduction\nscenario, maximising the use of lower grade land (semi-natural grassland, hill\nland etc.) releases 3.7 million of tillable grassland (including 1.3million ha\nof good arable land). The opposite approach of withdrawing production from less\ncapable land releases just 1.7 millionha of potentially arable land, with almost\nno release of the grassland well suited for to arable production. The land-use\ntrade-off is therefore clear. Under a 50% livestock consumption reduction\nscenario, 2 million ha of tillable grassland is required to compensate for the\nwithdrawal of cattle and sheep production from 6.9 million ha of non-tillable\ngrassland. A 50% reduction in livestock product consumption opens up the\nopportunity to release about half of UK land currently used for UK food supplies\nif remaining production is concentrated on the more capable land. If land is\nreleased uniformly, almost two-thirds of this release takes place on grassland\nnot suited to arable production and the remaining third is grassland with some\narable potential. There would be with higher levels of land release in Scotland,\nWales and Northern Ireland than in England. Depending on where the remaining\nproduction takes place, a large proportion of land released may be very\nunproductive, but it can be assumed that about 5 million ha with potential for\nother agricultural uses would be available, for example for the production of\nlivestock for export (if they did not reduce their livestock consumption), for\nproducing arable biofuel crops, planted woodland and re-wilding (to natural\nwoodland in many cases). Greenhouse gas emissionsAll consumption scenarios\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions from primary production. The largest reduction\nis from a livestock reduction scenario (Consumption Scenario 1): from 81 to\n66MtCO2e (19% reduction). The switch from red to white meat reduces emissions by\n9% and a 50% reduction in white meat consumption by only 3%. The net effect on\nemissions depends greatly on the alternative use of the grassland released from\nfood production. The study indicates the range of possible consequences on soil\nand biomass fluxes. If all tillable grassland released from food production was\nconverted to arable use, 8 to 17MtCO2e per year would be released over 20 years\nthrough the effects of land use change. Converting all released land with the\npotential to support good tree growth to woodland would cause a net carbon\nuptake equivalent to about 7.5 to 9.5MtCO2e per year in soil and wood per year\nover 20 years. Land use preference (e.g. focusing remaining production on high\nquality land) has little effect on emissions. This is an important result\nindicating that supply chain emissions are unresponsive to changes in industry\nstructure with respect to the land used. The location of emissions reductions\n(UK or overseas) was identified. Currently, we estimate that 36% of primary\nproduction emissions are overseas. All scenarios reduce UK emissions while\nConsumption Scenario 1 has little effect on overseas emissions and Consumption\nScenario 2 reduces overseas emissions by 5%. None of the scenarios involve a net\nexport of emissions and the GHG reduction benefits in the UK are proportionally\ngreater than those overseas because of the tight link between UK livestock\nconsumption and production. OTHER EFFECTS Other emissions All consumption\nscenarios are expected to reduce other emissions. Consumption Scenario 1 halves\nammonia emissions. Reductions in nitrate emissions, eutrophication emissions\ngenerally, and acidification are almost as large (ca 45%). Biodiversity and\ncarbon sequestration It is widely asserted that grassland, especially semi-\nnatural grassland, has a higher biodiversity value compared with other types of\nvegetation, natural climax vegetation for example. It is often claimed that the\nretention of these grasslands is important for the continued delivery of some\necosystem services, for example, carbon sequestration. In many other European\ncountries, the uplands and hills are usually wooded. For example, 32% and 29% of\nthe land area in Germany and France respectively are wooded compared with 12% in\nthe UK. Thus conversion to climax woodland or other forms of forestry is one\nobvious alternative use for released grassland. Our study has identified\nbenefits for carbon sequestration in soil when grassland is converted to\nwoodland (there should also be potential benefits in the use of harvested wood).\nOur analysis of land use statistics reveals the large proportion of UK land\ncurrently occupied by cattle and sheep. Without these livestock, this grassland\n(much of which is semi-natural grassland) would revert to the natural vegetation\n- deciduous woodland in many cases. Our results show that the use of livestock\nto retain semi-natural grasslands is not dependent on the current high level of\nlivestock product consumption. A 50% reduction in demand still leaves a market\nwhich is large enough to support this activity. However, given how a declining\nmarket affects all suppliers, a livestock reduction scenario presents special\nchallenges to the maintenance of semi-natural grasslands. Livestock systems\nprovide a wide range of services that are currently used by society. In a\nreduction scenario, rural areas lose skills and employment in the livestock\nsector and there would be ramifications for linked industries such as the meat\nprocessing or veterinary sectors. Culturally important features, for example,\nhedgerows and stone walls, and much of the fauna and flora associated with\ngrassland would be no longer needed. In the UK as a whole, land that is most\nlikely to be taken out of production is associated with difficult production\nconditions. In England, upland moorland and common land now in a semi-natural\nstate could change to fully natural vegetation cover. In upland areas, where the\nmajority of re-wilding under Consumption Scenario 1 and 2 would be located,\nevidence suggests that various natural communities including scrub, bracken,\nbramble, and woodland with their own assemblage of flora and fauna are likely to\ndevelop, with potential increases in wild herbivores such as deer, hares, and\nrabbits. The majority of SSSIs currently under-grazed occur in lowland areas,\nfor example in southern and eastern parts of England, and a lack of livestock\nresults in difficulty in applying the grazing pressure required to maintain the\nsemi-natural faunal and floral diversity. Recreational access to the uplands,\nwhich is now facilitated by open grassland landscapes, may be impaired and\nevidence suggests that visitors view the loss of traditional semi-natural\nlandscapes, with associated meadows, hedges, and stone walls, negatively. Whilst\na reduction in the current ecosystem service provision associated with livestock\nproduction from cattle and sheep can be expected under Consumption Scenarios 1\nand 2, the net change is also dependent on the alternative use to which land is\nput. In upland SSSIs, overgrazing is often problematic and reducing grazing\npressure may allow semi-natural habitats to recover, in particular dwarf shrub\nheaths, bogs, acid grassland and upland habitats. The release of large areas of\nland could also be used to diversify upland areas. For example, semi-natural\nupland woodlands have declined by 30-40% since the 1950s and the UK Habitat\nAction Plan has therefore included a target to increase the area of upland oak\nwoodland through planting or natural regeneration of current open ground. In the\nlowlands, approximately 10% of the current arable land could be released for\nother activities, such as bioenergy crops, woodlands, recreational land, wetland\ncreation, nature reserves, flood protection, carbon sequestration, and urban\ndevelopment. Each of these land uses will have its own specific range and flow\nof ecosystem services associated with it. While in general, the release of\nagricultural land with high environmental value from food production is not\nviewed as positive, Defra has concluded that there are likely to be situations\nwhere positive outcomes can occur. Economic considerations The reduction in the\namount of land needed to supply the UK goes hand-in-hand with a reduction in the\nvalue added by agriculture supplying UK consumed food. A 50% reduction in\nlivestock product consumption (Consumption Scenario 1) reduces the UK farm-gate\nvalue of livestock products from £7.6 to 3.5 billion. The farm-level economic\nimpact of a change along these lines will depend crucially on what replacement\noutput is found for the land released and on market effects that are beyond the\nscope of this study. One economic response scenario is that the land resource\nreleased remains in agriculture serving export markets. Another strategy is to\nuse the land for non-food purposes. Using biomass energy cropping as a benchmark\nand assuming a price of £40/tonne dry matter biomass wood, we estimate that\nreplacing the value of the food output of higher quality land released will be\nchallenging, although it is reported that biomass energy is an economically\nviable alternative to sheep production on uplands.[1] Potential unexpected or\nunintended consequences Changes to UK crop production The general conclusion\nthat a reduction in livestock production consumption will have little effect in\nto" ],

  "texts" : [ "Do Telecommunications Affect Passenger Travel or Vica Versa?", "This study explores the aggregate causal relationships between telecommunications and travel in a comprehensive framework, considering their demand, supply, and costs, together with land use, economic activity, and sociodemographic variables. On the basis of a hypothesized conceptual model, composite indexes were developed for endogenous variable categories (telecommunications and travel demand, supply, cost, land use, and economic activity) by confirmatory factor analysis, with the use of national time series data (1950 - 2000) in the United States. Then, single equation and structural equation models for telecommunications (telephone calls and mobile phone subscribers, separately) and travel were estimated, with the composite indexes and sociodemographic measures used as explanatory variables. Overall, the model results suggest that the aggregate relationship between actual amounts of travel and telecommunications is complementary, not substitution. That is, as telecommunications demand increases, travel demand increases, and vica versa. In addition, it was found that the causal effects of travel demand on telecommunications demand were larger than those in the reverse direction." ],

We identify two accounts, the compensated absence liability account and the unfunded pension liability account, which provide incumbent gubernatorial candidates with flexibility for manipulation. We find that, in an election year, the liability associated with compensated absences and unfunded pension liabilities are both systematically lower. We also find that the variation in these employment-related liabilities is correlated with proxies for the incumbent's incentives and ability to manipulate their accounting reports. Jointly, these results suggest that state governments manipulate accounting numbers to present a healthier financial picture in an election year." ],

Design: Reliability study. Participants: Thirty patients with non-specific low back pain (12 males, 18 females, mean age: 27.7 years (standard deviation 10.3) and 7 physiotherapists (raters). Methods: Based on a health professionals' consensus via focus groups and a Delphi servey, an examination procedure was developed comprising 206 items discriminatory for non-specific low back pain, 108 of which were from the History (clinical questions) and 98 from the Physical Examination (clinical tests) section. Utilizing this procedure, each patient was examined by a blinded pair of raters. Results: Moderate to excellent agreement was obtained in 125 (61%) items (77 History and 48 Physical Examination items), 47 of which obtained substantial or excellent agreement (kappa>0.61), 37 moderate agreement (kappa between 0.41 and 0.6), and 41 excellent percentage agreements. Poor reliability (kappa < 0.41) was yielded in the remaining 81 items (31 History and 50 Physical Examination items). Conclusion: Satisfactory reliability was obtained in nearly two-thirds of History and half of the Physical Examination items on a non-specific low back pain assessment list generated through consensus agreement. These findings provide clinicians and researchers with valuable information regarding which items are considered reliable and can be utilized in non-specific low back pain patient evaluation/assessment procedures, classification attempts and clinical trials." ],

  "texts" : [ "Condor-COPASI: high-throughput computing for biochemical networks.", "BACKGROUND: Mathematical modelling has become a standard technique to improve our understanding of complex biological systems. As models become larger and more complex, simulations and analyses require increasing amounts of computational power. Clusters of computers in a high-throughput computing environment can help to provide the resources required for computationally expensive model analysis. However, exploiting such a system can be difficult for users without the necessary expertise.\n\nRESULTS: We present Condor-COPASI, a server-based software tool that integrates COPASI, a biological pathway simulation tool, with Condor, a high-throughput computing environment. Condor-COPASI provides a web-based interface, which makes it extremely easy for a user to run a number of model simulation and analysis tasks in parallel. Tasks are transparently split into smaller parts, and submitted for execution on a Condor pool. Result output is presented to the user in a number of formats, including tables and interactive graphical displays.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Condor-COPASI can effectively use a Condor high-throughput computing environment to provide significant gains in performance for a number of model simulation and analysis tasks. Condor-COPASI is free, open source software, released under the Artistic License 2.0, and is suitable for use by any institution with access to a Condor pool.

  "title" : "Description Of Procedures In Automotive Engine Plants",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Description Of Procedures In Automotive Engine Plants", "1. Human resources\n- For automakers, the total cost of paying average workers is around $40000 per year (mean\nvalue); the numbers range from $30000 to $60000 (except for a Central European facility where it\nis much lower). On average, direct pay is three times the amount of benefits. In general, worker\nqualification does not affect the benefits policy within an automobile engine plant.\n- Overall, the average age of workers in engine plants is slightly above 40 years old. There is no\ndifference by geographic region. In older engine plants, workers do tend to be older. Annual\nturnover rates are around 5%. Mean values for unionization levels are 7990 for hourly workers,\n45% for salaried workers. It is common for production workers to be assigned different tasks; the\nengine plants where the union contract restricts the kind of activities are located in North America.\n- A majority of engine plants surveyed have work teams, and they are deployed in all departments.\nIn most cases, work teams were introduced about five years ago. Sometimes, work team leaders\nare not elected. The average training received is 41 hours per employee per year. Fluctuations in\nthe values are large. European facilities tend to have more training. Respondents felt that inspecting\none?s work, being well trained, designing one?s workplace and having suggestions accepted are\nfactors which can help workers make high quality engines. Workers and management interact via\nmeetings and surveys. There are usually fewer than 2 suggestions per worker per year. The more\ntraining people get, the more likely they are to make suggestions.\n2. Logistics\n- Delivery of parts to the assembly department of engine plants: the Japanese-owned facilities get a\nmuch higher fraction of these components delivered more than once per shift, compared to other\nplants. There are more instances of ?just-in-time? practice for castings and parts delivered to the\nmachining departments.\n- Engine and vehicle assembly plants: for half of our sample, the average delivery pace of finished\nengines to the car assembly plant is once per shift or more frequently. Engine plants which deliver\nengines very frequently no matter how far their customer vehicle assembly plants are located. The\naverage value of the average delivery size of finished engines is 273 units (the results are very\nvariable, but in general, the more engines are produced per unit time, the larger the batch size). For\none out of two engine plants, the average transit time to the customer vehicle assembly plant is less\nthan half a day; however, there are many cases where finished engines are delivered to vehicle\nassembly plants located very far away.\n3. Maintenance policies\n- Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) is in place in all of the plants surveyed, but this is quite\nrecent (implementation started between 1990 and 1994). In two out of three cases, it is based on a\ncentralized planning and information system. All of the key maintenance items mentioned in the\nquestionnaire are taken care of by all engine plants; however, the frequency at which maintenance\nis done varies a lot from plant to plant (average: one and a half times per week).\nProceduresinEnginePlants(ABSTRACT) MIT /IMVP --Oct.1997 Page2\n- Throughout all departments of engine plants, breakdowns are caused on average mostly by\nmechanical problems and then by electrical problems although there is a lot of variation between\nplants. For those types of failures, there is no link with any downtime statistics. Hydraulic failures\noccur more frequently in those plants which are older.\n4. Production technologies\n- Several of the engine plants surveyed are currently undergoing major changes. For a new engine\nvariant, most engine plants can deal with the adaptation by using much more than half of the\nexisting machines. In engine plants, a ?minor upgrade? can stop lines anywhere between less than\n24 hours to more than a week. Currently, assembly lines in engine plants can handle more\nflexibility than machining lines. When different engines are built in sequence, the pattern used most\noften is 1-1- 1-2-2-2 (batch sizes range from 6 to 100?s of engines).\n- Current and future design and acquisition processes for equipment do not differ. There is one\npolicy for the whole plant. For a majority of engine plants, the methodology is as follows: the\nautomobile company takes care of defining the requirements, it has a large influence (along with an\naffiliate or sister company sometimes) for the planning process, but the design and building of\nequipment is done by an outside equipment or system supplier. Two areas where answers differ a\nlot concern the system integration and the actual installation of equipment in engine plants: in some\ncases, the automobile company is in charge, while in other cases, an outside firm does the job.\n5. Quality\n- Engines made in European plants have more complaints per 1000 than the North American or\nJapanese ones (caution: we have rather few of these data points from non-European plants).\nEngine quality as measured by complaints per 1000 units after engines are delivered: 3-month\nquality data are quite good predictors of 12-month data.\n- In almost all engine plants, Statistical Process Control (SPC) data are collected and displayed at\nthe line or work station. Engine plants also get back some engine performance and warranty data.\n- In most instances, communication of engine design information is done via fax or hardcopy.\nSometimes, CAD systems (mostly 2-D) are used to exchange design dat~ however, whether CAD\nsystems are used or not, is not a function of the age of the engine plant or of the lines. In a majority\nof cases, the exchange of information between the plant and the engine design department take\nplace weekly, with actual design changes happening monthly. On average, half of the design\nchanges are due to the engine engineering department, in order to improve the engine and to fix\ndesign or performance problems. Other causes for design changes are the meeting market needs,\nfixing production problems, and responding to the evolution of regulations.\n- All plants conduct hot testing of engines; in two facilities, only some of the engines are hottested.\nThe test can last from 45 seconds to 18 minutes. The (few) all-aluminum engines of our\nsurvey are among those which undergo longer periods of hot testing. Less than 7% of the engines\nfail the hot test the first time. By looking simultaneously at the engine quality data and at the hot\ntesting results, we did not find any correlation: hot test duration does not uncover problems which\ncause quality complaints 3 or 12 months after the engines are delivered to customers.\nProceduresin EnginePlants(ABSTRACT) MIT /IMVP --Oct.1997 Page 3\n- According toourrespondents, production technologies thatcan becritical formanufacturing high\nquality automotive engines concern machining operations more than the sub-assembly and final\ndressing ofengines; interestingly, these technologies are most often supplied by outside vendors.\nIn addition, organizational factors are seen as much more effective than automatization, in order to\nproduce high-quality engines.\n6. Information systems\n- Information systems are in place in engine plants, and they are used quite extensively.\n- While centralized systems tend to be used mainly for planning purposes, non-centralized\ncomputer systems can help compile some statistical data and tell about equipment problems. Rarely\nare information systems actually used to give work assignments to employees.\n7. Accounting procedures and investment decisions\n- For a series of recent major installations of equipment in engine plants, it took around two years\nbetween the approval of the plan and the moment when the first part was produced, and from there\non, an extra three to six months for full production levels to be reached.\n- The top financial indicator used by car firms for measuring the ?performance? of engine plants is\nclearly variance from budget. Some financial ratios like return on equity or return on assets are not\nused at all. For non-financial indicators, the quality of engines is most important, followed by\nsafety and environment concerns, logistical issues, and labor productivity.\n- Product quality and internal rate of return are the two most important factors involved in engine\nplant investment decisions.\n- Most common practice is that indirect cost allocation uses standard or actual labor hours.\n- Activity-based costing systems were in place in 30% of the engine plants surveyed ( 1995 data).\n8. Plant improvement efforts\n- The persons surveyed do not think that more automation will be the key for progress in engine\nmanufacturing. For the future, a strong desire is the ability to improve the flexibility of the factory,\nof the machines, and of the material flow. Interestingly, the respondents most interested by\nflexibility improvements are based in engine plants which currently deal with rather low levels of\nengine variety.\n- On the list of factors which can help improve operations in engine plants, is the need to establish\nbetter contacts with people in the engine design department and with the suppliers of machinery.\nAlso, being able to build more engines in less space is an important goal for several respondents;\nactually, those most interested by this issue are from engine plants where the utilization of space is\nalready more efficient than on average.\nThis study was sponsored by the International Motor Vehicie Program.

The juice was administered orally to adult albino rats the rats; group A received 0.5ml twice per day of the fruit juice for one week. Group B received 1.0ml twice per day for one week. Group C received 1.5ml twice per day of the white Citrus x paradisi juice , while in group D served as control for the experiment. The entire weight study signifies that the loss of weight with White Citrus x paradisi Juice is dose and duration dependent. ALT, AST and ALP in all the groups of this study were elevated apart from group A, of ALP which is lower than the control. Tissues of the liver showed sinusoidal dilatation, inflammatory cells in the portal vein and loss of radial architecture. All hepatocytes were normal.

  "texts" : [ "The Role of Interest Rates in Business Cycle Fluctuations in Emerging Market Countries", "Emerging market countries have enjoyed an exceptionally favorable economic environment throughout 2004, 2005, and early 2006. In particular, accommodative U.S. monetary policy in recent years has helped create an environment of low interest rates in international capital markets. However, if world interest rates were to take a sudden upward course, this would lead to less hospitable financing conditions for emerging market countries. The purpose of this paper is to measure the effects of world interest rate shocks on real activity in Thailand. The analysis incorporates balance sheet related credit market frictions into the IMF’s Global Economy Model (GEM) and finds that Thailand would best minimize the adverse effects of rising world interest rates if it were to follow a flexible exchange rate regime.Interest rates;Emerging markets;Economic models;exchange rate, flexible exchange rate, exchange rate regime, bond, bond market, exchange rate regimes, flexible exchange rate regime, nominal exchange rate, fixed exchange rate, emerging market bonds, global bond, exchange rate policy, global bond market, bonds, international financial statistics, emerging bond market, international interest rates, financial markets, fixed exchange rate regime, international financial markets, international capital, international finance, international capital markets, foreign exchange, foreign exchange market, financial stability, exchange rate movements, government bond yields, fixed exchange rate policy, financial fragility, government bond, interest rate fluctuations, exchange rates, exchange rate flexibility, nominal interest rate, bond yields, money market, money market rate, flexible exchange rate policy, stock losses" ],

  "title" : "Open Cube",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Open Cube", "White Cube Mason's Yard presented 'Open Cube', an international group exhibition organised by São Paulo-based curator Adriano Pedrosa. Invited by the gallery to curate an exhibition, Pedrosa launched a process of open submission via Art Agenda in January 2013, under the title 'Call for entries: 'Open Cube' at White Cube Mason's Yard'. The only requirement was that the artist needed to be available for an interview in London with the curator, in March 2013. 'Open Cube' received over 2,900 applicants, of which Pedrosa interviewed 38 and selected a final group of 17 artists. Taking his cue from Brian O'Doherty's seminal book Inside the White Cube, the Ideology of the Gallery Space (1976), Pedrosa's exhibition challenged the identity of White Cube as an organisation, as a physical space and as a concept, questioning the complex relationships between existent notions of 'inside' and 'outside', value and economics. By opening up the curatorial selection process beyond his own networks and meeting with artists who were previously unknown to him, Pedrosa confronts what he perceives to be the standard gallery practice of seemingly closed systems that exist in the criteria for staging exhibitions. The works in the ground-floor gallery were concerned with the concept of the 'white cube' and the 'open cube' itself, of public and private spaces, as well as value and currency. The works in the lower ground-floor gallery presented different forms of abstraction - constructivist and geometric and also organic, amorphous, fluid types - yet many of these run counter to traditional modernist abstract idioms. The 17 artists included in this exhibition, from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, The Netherlands, Portugal, Ireland, UK and USA, had created work that seeks, as Pedrosa says, ‘to contest these national boundaries as well as the very identity of White Cube itself.’ In the accompanying catalogue, which includes transcripts of the interviews Pedrosa conducted with the 17 selected artists, he suggests that the 'Open Cube' is a transparent cube and sets out to reveal what goes on behind the gallery doors. Pedrosa is himself interviewed by Pablo Leon de la Barra, in order to expose his own methods and the motivations behind this exhibition. The publication is fully illustrated and will be available in September 2013. Artists: Matt Ager was born in 1985 in England and lives and works in London.

  "texts" : [ "The use of nurses' and carers' observations in the identification of poststroke depression.", "AIM: This paper is a report of a study to determine the accuracy and utility of an observational screening tool (Signs of Depression Scale), when rated by nurses and carers for detecting depression in patients who have recently had a stroke. BACKGROUND: Depression following a stroke is common and adversely affects recovery and rehabilitation. Identifying depression when patients have communication and cognitive difficulties is especially problematic. Screening tools which rely solely on observation may be beneficial in this group. METHOD: A cross-sectional study of people admitted with an acute stroke compared a clinical diagnosis of depression by a psychiatrist (the gold standard) with the Signs of Depression Scale completed by nurses and carers. The agreement between nurses' and carers' ratings was also explored. Data were collected over 10 months (December 2004-October 2005). FINDINGS: Seventy-one patients were included in the study, median age 70 [inter-quartile ranges (IQR) 59-76], including 40 (56.3%) males. The psychiatrist classified 25/71 (35.2%) patients as depressed. Using the recommended cut-point of 2 or more on the Signs of Depression Scale, the nurse and carer respectively rated 27/71 (38.0%) and 18/30 (60.0%) patients as potentially depressed. The proportion of patients correctly identified as depressed by the test (sensitivity) when rated by nurses was 64%, and the proportion of patients not depressed who were correctly identified by the test (specificity) was 61%, whereas carers achieved sensitivity 90% and specificity 35%. The optimal cut-point for carers was higher at 4 or more. Inter-rater agreement on the Signs of Depression Scale between nurses and carers was fair (ICC = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.09-0.68). CONCLUSION: The Signs of Depression Scale is easily completed by clinical staff, although we found the sensitivity when completed by nurses to be low. Information from carers shows potential to improve screening and it is important for nurses to value the knowledge and skills of carers in detecting depression following a stroke. Further refinement of the Signs of Depression Scale, with accompanying research, is required." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "An Architecture For Shared Multi-User Client Rendering Of Massive Geodatasets", "We are developing a novel data-centric visualization architecture to allow interactive exploration of geophysical data. Our method allows multiple users to collaborate in a lightweight, loosely-coupled and highly scalable environment. We choose 3D seismic data for our case study. Existing visualization solutions for data exploratory tasks are mainly application-centric rather than data-centric. They typically store large datasets on users’ local machines for fast access. Additionally, data objects that are the focus of study, e.g. seismic surveys and interpreted geological features, are managed as objects that are independent of the primary data. Thus multi-user collaborations where different users visually share their geological interpretations are handled inefficiently since objects from each interpretation are stored as independent discrete objects. These objects may be stored separately from the primary data, e.g. on local disks, ensuring a coherent multi-user view is difficult. Our visual analytic method places a central data structure built on a Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) relational database at the heart of the visualization architecture. This structure allows us to develop the following efficient methods for data retrieval and display: -global hashing for spatial reference on all datasets -interpretation tagging which accumulate user interpretation into the database -multi-user concurrent access allowing parallel multi-threading queries In our data structure, data elements are indexed on their geolocations by a hashing algorithm. The hashing algorithm determines the location of the required row through hashing functions without a construction or any storage complexity. This is unlike other conventional indexing algorithms such as bitmapping or tree-based methods where construction and storage (of the index table) complexity varies between O(n) and O(n log n) where n is the size of the dataset. Also, we replace the geometric objects formed as a result of user geological interpretations with what we call ‘features’. A feature is a logical subset of the original data with each key-value pair tagged as belonging to a particular spatial feature. Thus, instead of a surface being considered as composed of polygons it is now a tagged subset of the data. Our architecture requires an intermediate stage which builds in real-time a volume in a format which can be directly rendered on a client GPU. We call this a Feature-Embedded Spatial Volume (FESVo). In this stage we utilize the indexing and parallel capabilities of the database to perform parallel queries, and on-the-fly down-sampling if lower resolution is required, at a complexity of O(k), where k is the number of data units fetched from the database, similar to searching complexity with the bitmapping index method. Also, user interactions with the visualization are saved back to the database as point tags allowing immediate knowledge sharing. We present a technical and functional architecture for a data-centric approach and how it scales to overcome access and analytical latency in client-server data interactions. Preliminary experimental evaluation shows potential advantages of such a system in terms of security and centralised data management for subsurface data visualization systems. Also, we believe that our architecture can lead to a web-based visualization environment for geoscientific data." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "A purchase decision-making process model of online consumers and its influential factora cross sector analysis", "This research explores the online purchase decision-making behaviour of consumers by introducing a comprehensive approach that covers two different viewpoints: a) individual-level behaviour and b) market-level behaviour. Individual-level behaviour enhances our understanding of how purchase decision-making processes unfold and whether they differ for different individuals. Drawing from decision analysis and consumer behaviour literature, four segments of online consumers are introduced based on two individual factors: decision making style and knowledge of the product. Archetypal behaviour of each segment is identified addressing variations in the process and process outcome for different groups. In addition, market-level behaviour investigates the actual behaviour of consumers in relation with different retailers in the market; it is based on the aggregated behaviour of 60,000 individuals. Not only behaviour in a particular website but also cross-visiting behaviour of consumers comparing multiple retailers is examined. For this purpose, a multi-level mixed-method approach is designed. Video recording sessions, think-aloud method, interviews and questionnaires are used to capture the dynamic decision-making process, segment consumers and measure the outcome of the process at individual level. Business process modeling approach and an adaptation of path configuration method are selected for modelling the process. Data from an Internet panel data provider, comScore, is analyzed to explore the market-behaviour of consumers visiting multiple retailers. A set of measurement frameworks, that have been developed to fully exploit the research potential of Internet panel data, are designed for this research. Two sectors of banking and mobile network providers are selected; this research methodology enables a much more detailed evaluation of online behaviour and can be applied in other consumer markets.A conceptual model of online purchase decision making is proposed synthesizing theory from three disciplines: consumer behaviour, decision analysis and Information Systems. This model is able to explain the complexities and dynamic nature of real-life decision-making processes. The results of individual-level analysis show that the synthesized model has an enhanced descriptive power. Purchase decision-making processes in the two sectors appear to be highly complex with a large number of iterations, being more unstructured in banking sector. The process is found to be influenced by the both individual characteristics and each segment exhibits a certain typology of behaviour. Behaviour in terms of the way stages are performed is identical across the two sectors; whereas it differs in relation to intensity of decision-making cycles, duration of the process and the process outcome, being a function of product/ market characteristics.The findings of market-level analysis revealed that banking websites are preliminary visited for using online banking services; despite the high portion of visitors, the intensity of research in these websites is low. On the contrary, mobile network providers attract a higher portion of consumers with purchase intentions and enjoy more intensive research. Consumers have a small consideration set in both sectors; and consider certain banks/providers rather than using the accessibility of all alterative on the Internet. It is evident that comparison sites play an important role in both markets affecting the behaviour of online consumers.  Finally, the research stresses the use of the Internet as a complementary channel offering specific benefits in each sector." ],

  "texts" : [ "[[alternative]]Study of Elementary School Principal''s Moral Leadership, School culture and Students'' Learning Achievement", "[[abstract]]The main purpose of the study is first to comprehend the actual condition among elementary school principal’s moral leadership, school culture and students’ learning achievement in Chia-Yi County of Taiwan. Next, the variances of perception principal’s moral leadership, school culture and students’ learning achievement by elementary school teacher based on different personal background and different school environment variables are compared, and further explore the relationship among principal’s moral leadership, school culture and students’ learning achievement.Survey research is conducted in this study. Take “A questionnaire of elementary school principal’s moral leadership, school culture and students’ learning achievement” as a study tool. Survey subjects are 606 elementary school teachers from Chia-Yi County, sampled according to random sampling and purposive sampling, and there are totally 534 copies of effective samples collected. Make an analysis about the study data in ways of mean, standard deviation, ANOVA, Pearson product-moment correlation, multiple regression analysis and LISREL. After generalizing the outcome of the study analysis, obtain the conclusions as follows:1.Elementary school teachers’ perception of principal’s moral leadership, school culture and students’ learning achievement is above average.2.Significant differences are found on the part of elementary school teachers’ perception of principal’s moral leadership, given the consideration of demographic variations of the teachers: gender, post, principal’s age.3.Significant differences are found on the part of elementary school teachers’ perception of school culture, given the consideration of demographic variations of the teachers’ post.4.Significant differences are found on the part of elementary school teachers’ perception of students’ learning achievement, given the consideration of demographic variations of the teachers: gender, post, and the school size, location.5.Significant differences are found on the part of elementary school students’ score of exam, given the consideration of demographic variations of the school size.6.Significant correlations among are found on every subpart of principal’s moral leadership, school culture and students’ learning achievement.7.Significant differences are found on the part of elementary school teachers’ perception of school culture, and students’ learning achievement, given the consideration of demographic variations of the teachers’ perception of principal’s moral leadership. Teachers with higher principal’s moral leadership would have higher school culture, and students’ learning achievement.8.Significant differences are found on the part of elementary school teachers’ perception of students’ learning achievement, given the consideration of demographic variations of the type of school culture. Hothouse is the best.9.Significant differences are found on the part of elementary school students’ score of exam, given the consideration of demographic variations of the type of school culture. Welfarist is the worst.10.Having explanatory functions of students’ learning achievement from principal’s moral leadership ,school culture, personal background variables and school environment variables, and the subpart of school culture ”social cohesion” is the most explanatory.11.The subparts of school culture are more explanatory than those of principal’s moral leadership.12.The “structural equation modeling of principal’s moral leadership, school culture and students’ learning achievement” is mediocre fit.13.Principal’s moral leadership influences school culture, school culture influences the teachers’ perception of students’ learning achievement. Principal’s moral leadership influences the teachers’ perception of students’ learning achievement thorough school culture.Lastly, depending on the above research conclusions, offer some related suggestions to be the reference for the educational administration authorities concerned, elementary school principals and the future." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Breaking the Letter: Illegibility as Intersign in Cy Twombly, Steve McCaffery, and Susan Howe.", "This dissertation analyzes different forms of illegibility in the works of Cy Twombly, Steve McCaffery, and Susan Howe within the context of postwar experimental art and poetry in North America. From the 1950s onward, interest in intermedium experimentation prompted American artists and poets to explore the visuality of writing, and to pursue strategies for breaking down the letter as the smallest graphemic unit in alphabetic writing systems through occlusion or eradication. How do we interpret marks that are variously effaced, erased, covered, cut, and fragmented to resist notational decipherment? The dissertation considers the suspension between text and image as ???intersign,??? and proposes ???scanning??? as an interpretive mode that mediates between seeing and reading, without assuming the priority of verbal or iconic legibility. Such intersemiotic illegibility seemingly escapes interpretation, yet simultaneously invites more complex interpretive strategies that are demonstrated in each chapter. The Introduction provides a theoretical and historical framework for 20th-century inter-arts experiments, while also touching on earlier European avant-gardes, to frame the artists and poets??? use of illegibility in the postwar North American context. Chapter One focuses on Twombly???s scribblings in paintings, drawings, and prints from 1959 to 1968: by juxtaposing his own name (inscribed in handwriterly marks) with the half-covered inscriptions of names of classical poets like Sappho, Twombly foregrounds the fragmentation of the modern artist???s signature. Chapter Two turns to Carnival, composed by McCaffery from 1967 to 1977, as a hybrid text that challenges reading habits by its ???destructible??? book format and complex typewriter techniques. Chapter Three explores Howe???s typographic experiments from her early to later poetry, culminating in Souls of the Labadie Tract (2007), where the cutting up of letters into ???microfonts??? interrogates the divide between text and image. The conclusion reflects further on the critical and cultural environment where artists and poets looked to each other to explore new possibilities for American poetry. In moving between visual arts and experimental poetics, between art history and literary criticism, and between pictoriality and textuality, the dissertation places the concept of illegibility in a broader interpretive context." ],

  "texts" : [ "European Temporary Staffing: The Changing Regulatory Landscape", "In Europe, a policy priority is to maintain a balance between flexibility and employment security (OECD, 2004). The concept of achieving an appropriate balance in the labour market between ensuring the flexibility of employment options and providing sufficient levels of social security has been termed flexicurity (OECD, 2004). Temporary agency work, in turn, is seen as a facilitator of flexibilisation and hence a key component of the drive towards a labour market that operates on this flexicurity principle (ILO, 2009). Restrictive regulation is seen as a prime obstacle to the expansion of the temporary staffing industry and historically there have been many areas of Europe that have been dominated by strict employment protection legislation (EC, 2009). This Working Brief outlines patterns of the regulation of temporary agency work across Europe from 1990 to 2008 using one of the OECD Employment Protection Legislation Index measures." ],

  "texts" : [ "Saving, spending, and future-making: time, discipline, and money in development", "Informed accounts of social practices around saving and collective remittances in poor countries this paper examines how the malleability of money enables it to have the potential for formalisation which allows it to be brought into formal relations of future-making and foreclosure, at the same time as its potential for investments and reallocation enables it to be the basis of flexible and adaptive strategies of future-making. We show how individuals engaged in development aspirations strive to achieve futures through the collection, care, and use of money, and how strategies of formalisation, discipline, and framing accord money developmental capacities. The liquidity of money renders it a flexible vehicle for personal and collective aspirations while representing risk of leakage to other persons and ventures. The paper examines the strategies used by low-income savers and hometown associations in their concerns with establishing rules and discipline around the flexibility of money." ],

Association of the Schools of Social Work (IASSW).July 20-24 2008. Durban, South Africa.(Peer Reviewed", "Social models are influential in international social policy, treating social inclusion as a central remedy to health and social care concerns.  This promises great potential for social work to promote its international social justice and individual empowerment value-base, linked to social understandings of service users' concerns (International Association of Schools of Social Work and the International Federation of Social Workers 2001), However, social theory encompasses different perspectives, carrying radically different policy and practice implications. International social inclusion policy assumes social theory that treats social inclusion itself, accessed through individual capacity, participation, and self management of health as the best route to positive outcomes. Significantly, however, these understandings are linked to the historical European Enlightenment concept of the normal human being as completely in control of self and environment, seeing vulnerability to the impact of social and biological forces as marginal in human society. The paper will therefore trace the socio-historical assumptions involved in these policies, together with their implications for the exclusion of service users facing immense damage, suffering and social injustice through inequalities,  those who cannot aspire to self-sufficiency, and individuals, cultures and social groups with different values.  The paper will then explore alternative social theories which both recognise human beings as authors of their lives but also heavily impacted upon by social exclusion and inequalities, and will trace the implications of these perspectives for emancipatory policy and practice, which recognises the universality of vulnerability to suffering and social injustice, and the particularity of human difference, across the globe." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Doing Belonging: a sociological study of belonging in place as the outcome of social practices", "Place is disguised, hidden or simply ignored in much sociological research. Belonging, however, has become a focus of sociological concern. This thesis proposes that one way of belonging is through belonging-in-place leading to a sociological positioning of place as an active participant in social life. In much sociological research places have been seen as fixed and essentialised. To avoid this problem, this study turned to geography and anthropology for suitable frameworks incorporating an open, fluid and relational understanding of place. In particular, Ingold’s (2000) concept of the ‘taskscape’ has been used to understand the connections between place, people, activity and time. The thesis argues that ‘imagined’ and narrativised places create only an ‘outer layer’ of belonging and that it is through embodied connections to other people in the place (what I call a ‘peoplescape’) and through inalienable connections to material places over time that a three dimensional ‘ontological belonging’, as a way of being (and doing) in the world, can develop. Belonging, often spoken of as a sense or feeling, is here shown to be the outcome of social practices, by embodied beings, in a material place.The research took a phenomenological approach in order to see the life-world of the participants from within. A multi-dimensional belonging was uncovered through various user driven qualitative methods: biographical interviews and photo and written diaries with families who have lived in one place, Wigan, for at least three generations. The diaries detailed social encounters which revealed that knowing other people and being known are crucial to an embodied belonging-in-place. Taking photos alongside the diaries enabled specific places of importance to the respondents to be discussed and these revealed that places can be passed on, as inalienable gifts, from one generation, or one life phase, to the next. Inalienable traces of previous generations of Wiganers are present in the material place. The phenomenological methodology and the mix of qualitative methods enabled an inductive analysis which disclosed the everyday life-world of these people in this place. Diaries, both written and photographic, together with other respondent directed methods could be used more widely to explore seemingly mundane aspects of social life from the perspective of the participants. The research found that place is not merely a backdrop to social life but is an integral part of the social practices carried out by embodied and emplaced people. A greater emphasis on both place and materiality as they impact social life could enhance much sociological research." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Trädgård i skolan - skola i trädgården", "The starting point for the research is my general interest of outdoor environments for children and youth in cities, and how these environments are (or could be) used for play, recreation and education from nursery to nine-year compulsory school. When the research work started I thought I was mainly interested in practical, school related and cultivation-orientated problems. But as my work advanced it was clear that my interest was broader. I became more interested in the interplay between places and learning in a general sense. Chapter 1: Introduction The aim of this work is to document and describe characteristics of use, impact and importance of existing school gardens and their relations to other education activities. The research questions are: A) What characterise the school garden as a place? B) What characterise learning in the school garden? C) In what ways can the school garden be interpreted both as a place and learning resource? I discuss and introduce the methods and material that have been used in the research process. The research work is dominated by qualitative methods. The “qualitative research interview” used for collecting empirical data in the field investigation is discussed in chapter 5. Chapter 2: The attributes of outdoor education Part of the research examines school gardening in relation to common outdoor education activities in Sweden and other countries. The study summaries the attributes of outdoor education found in Swedish literature. One general aspect of outdoor learning discussed is how outdoor education can be regarded both as a place for learning, an object of learning and a way of learning. My suggestion is that school gardening can be regarded in the same way. In a short historical retrospective the development from the first school gardens in Sweden, established in the beginning of the 19th century in the old elementary schools of Sweden is described. In spite of many educational arguments, often based on John Dewey and the pragmatism, practically all school gardens in Sweden were removed during the 1960’s. One important reason was the technical development in agriculture, food production and food distribution. It was not necessary for people to grow their own food themselves anymore. But in the 1970’s and 1980’s, with increasing environmental problems, a discussion started surrounding environmental education in schools. The school ground was now regarded as one of the educational opportunities for that purpose. Slowly the interest also increased for the school garden as an educational tool, a tool which could often be described as an ecological laboratory. By 1986 there were about 30 school gardens in Sweden. The same year a research project started at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences with the aim to study and develop methods for educational use of school gardens in Swedish primary schools. The three schools included in that project are a part of my field investigation in chapter 5. The research shows that during the last 200 years, there are two periods when school gardening is most popular; at the turn of the 20th century when peasant society was declining and industrial society was growing very fast, and 90-100 years later, when the industrial society is declining at the same time as the growth of “information society” is advancing. Chapter 3: Perspectives of places and learning This chapter is a discussion about connections and close points of similarities between learning regarded as a constantly on-going process; as a creative urge of the human being; as a human expression at striving for new situations, and places used for these purposes. Learning and creativity are discussed as two aspects of the same phenomenon and as two fundamental motives for the human being to understand and form the world she is a part of. By discussing the situated nature of learning, and learning in socio-cultural and pragmatic contexts, I focus on the need for using physical tools, intellectual/linguistic tools and communication for describing the characteristics of learning in outdoor situations. By discussing places in terms of “sense of place” and “a place is a space claimed by feelings”, I among other things want to focus on a way of looking at physical outdoor environments as relationships between humans and the landscape. With inspiration from Torsten Hägerstrand I discuss the place as a combination of space and time, the landscape as a visual expression of a tight weave of relations that allow or prevent courses of events. I also discuss how places respond to human activities and the use of places as a sort of design process. I also reflect on the interaction between humans, living organisms and the inertia. My conclusion is that there are several connections and similarities in the research of learning respectively research of places, such as: 1) Situation as an engine in learning and for the creative urge. 2) The creating of meaning. 3) The development of identity. 4) The development of thinking and knowledge in a situated and cultural context mediated by tools. 5) Communication between people, but also between people and the physical environments. My assumption is that the school garden can be regarded as a weave of relations between pupils and teachers in co-operation with the cultivated nature that allows or prevents courses of events. Chapter 4: The “where” of learning Based upon my observations in literature, Webb-sites, handbooks, journals and press cuttings from daily p0apers 1992-2002, the “where” of learning in school versus outside school is analysed. As shown in fig. 4 characteristics for four different qualitatively separated themes for place activities in school are clarified. The figure is a model of where such activities take place and shows how they differ from and relate to each other. “Text based practices” are often situated indoors. Pupils use books and Internet for learning about things, and at least in Sweden it is common that they very often just reproduce facts and information from these sources in their school work. The aim on projects in the school ground is often to make the outdoor environment more attractive for play, recreation and learning. The outdoor role of the pupil is to be a constructor or creator, for example in building benches, fences, ponds, planting trees and bushes, painting the asphalt or using the school ground for sculptures and other art work. In these place activities the pupils often participate in decisions, design and construction. School gardening is based on coming back to the same place over the year to maintain different sorts of crops. Teachers and pupil are managers with a responsibility for living plants. They act together with nature, where cultivated nature responds to the activities done in the cultivation areas. Field trips have a long tradition in Sweden, where teachers and pupils visit city environments, parks, cultural landscapes, historical places and nature outside the school. These kinds of visits, as is common for tourists, are mainly based on participation by looking and observing rather than by doing. Chapter 5: School gardening in practice Six schools are included in the field investigation. Each school is, or has been working, in cultivation activities with children that are 5-12 years old. One of the schools is British; Coombes School in Arborfield near Reading. The school is quite well known abroad for their holistic approach to education both outdoor and indoor, for the fascinating school grounds and for their teaching and learning methods (Olsson, et al. 2003). The Swedish schools are spread out all over the whole of country with different opportunities for school gardening. They are all common Swedish compulsory schools. Three of them were included in the project mentioned previously. The fifth school is a Rudolf Steiner school with school gardening stated as a subject in the local curriculum. The sixth school is special as they have extensions of cultivating potatoes and onions enough to feed the schools 60 pupils all the year around. The field investigation is composed of 19 research interviews and 4 other recorded conversations. The results are divided and discussed in two themes; what the interviewees say about the school garden as a place respectively as a learning resource. WHAT IS TOLD ABOUT THE SCHOOL GARDEN AS A PLACE? Some of the statements shown in the interviews are characterised by: - School gardening need professional organisation and management. The board of the school should in general be more active, and the school garden should not be placed outside the school grounds. - The school garden is regarded as a classroom, living library, laboratory, scene and virtual room (in computers and pupils minds) with opportunities to make school subjects come alive. - The school garden is a model for the productive culture landscape, and a producing landscape, a base for cooking and handicraft. It is a place where the children participate in building ecological cycles and have opportunities to understand more about sustainable development. - The school garden is a place for health and well-being. It is a place where you must work slowly. The school garden means fresh air, beauty and a place for city kids to be connected with nature. - Identity; practical, creative work in the garden as a way of establishing a relationship to places and to nature. To give identity to the garden at the same time as the garden becomes a part of the child’s identity. WHAT IS TOLD ABOUT THE SCHOOL GARDEN AS LEARNING? Some of the statements shown in the interviews are characterised by: - School gardening as a process and a “trampoline” to knowledge, places and environments outside the school grounds. - Learning in different levels, where the point is to combine practical garden work with more theoretical reflections. School gardening stimulates learning also in the classroom. All sorts of children like gardening. As teacher you can never know from the beginning who will enjoy or benefit from school gardening. - The professional role as teacher is changing after working with school gardening on regards to development of how knowledge, and developing teaching and learning strategies. But there is also need for more teacher training, more time for planning with colleagues and more “green support” from the community outside school. - School gardening means more and new opportunities in education, in thematic work and in teaching school subjects. It is easier to explain and explore in ways that books cannot provide. School gardening is learning by doing. It is easy to work with “sharing and caring” principles for sustainability with the school garden as a starting point. - School gardening results in new social roles. For example it is more obvious in the school garden that teachers learn together with children more than in the classroom. That means that teachers become more like a co-discoverer outdoors than indoors. Chapter 6: The function and importance of school gardens The results from the field investigation are compared to the theoretical reflections in chapter 3. How the interviewees talk about the school as place and learning resources is discussed. The aim is to characterise some opinions among teachers about school gardening as a phenomenon. The discussion focuses on three main perspectives. 1. THE SCHOOL GARDEN AS A TOOL FOR NEW TEACHING AND LEARNING STRATEGIES Teachers understand the school garden as an opportunity to challenge their teaching methods and at the same time as an instrument for testing new requirements and methods for children’s learning. They also understand school gardening as an opportunity to take care of students’ curiosity and the asking questions. Focus in teaching is changing from a teacher centred detailed planning to more pupil centred work. Teachers also understand the school garden as a place, object and way of learning. They see the child as a part of what’s happening in the garden. The teachers also understand school gardening as interaction and interplay between practical work and theoretical reflection. Success in teaching is understood as being successful when using practical garden work as a source of inspiration in other school activities. But success also is a question about regarding individual experiences in the garden (without teaching) as important as well. 2. THE SCHOOL GARDEN AS A SOCIAL HUB Teachers opinion about school gardening is an opportunity for children to express and present themselves in new ways. School gardening promotes varieties of social situations leading to new social relationships between teachers and pupils, pupils and other pupils and pupils and relatives helping the children in the cultivation activities. Teachers also understand the school garden as a focal point between the school and other parts of the municipality. They also understand the school garden as a reason to establish such contacts. But their opinion is also that some of the actors outside school should take a greater responsibility for administration and organising the garden work, to guarantee that school gardening can continue from one year to another. 3. THE SCHOOL GARDEN BOTH AS ACTOR AND A STORY When a school garden is laid out children and adults begin to take care of their school surroundings in new ways. They who use and own the school garden load it with meaning and importance. Teachers and pupils act in the school garden; they sow and plant in the spring; water and weed in the summer; and pick flowers until that season is over. The garden responds to the work that is done. Plants, animals and the place itself “talk” to the children. The school garden becomes a language, at the very least a kind of communication between the place and the people who belong to the place. Practical garden work increases the beauty of the school ground. The creative work and approach to the school garden is appropriated into the local culture of the school over time. It becomes a local culture with educational and recreational aims in which children and teachers of the school can participate. The impression of the school garden is linked to a specific place where people from one year to another interact in physical and social actions, with regards to the place as an actor. And where there are actors a story can start growing. My conclusion is that there are at least three main aspects of the function and importance of school gardens: 1) People always relate themselves to places. People establish these relationships by personal experiences on site. 2) People always use creative actions as a driving force. The aim is to understand and form the world they live in and are a part of. School gardening is a vehicle for knowledge through interactive learning, as apposed to a passive approach to learning. 3) The situated dialogue between people and places, and the drama developing from maintenance and the influences of the status of the soil, sunshine, wind, rain, animals, pest and diseases, lead to the conclusion that the school garden is both an actor and a story at the same time. Children and adults are all embedded in the same drama communicating with friends, but also with other living organisms and inert objects. From a more pragmatic point of view the garden is a story about cultivation as culture. The school garden provides means to understand ecological systems and cultivation – especially for children living in urban environments." ],

Based on the current, light signals and streamer images, characteristics of both positive and negative streamers on pressboard surface were described, which resemble the features of streamers in open liquid gaps. Introducing pressboard in parallel does not influence the streamer stopping length and thus not weaken the oil gap breakdown voltage, under both positive and negative polarities at gap distances up to 75 mm. However, presence of parallel pressboard significantly reduces the acceleration voltage in mineral oil but seems have no influence on ester liquids under positive polarity, while it tends to accelerate the streamer velocity at larger gap distance and under higher voltage in both ester liquids and mineral oil under negative polarity. Generally, streamer on ester/pressboard interface propagates further than on mineral oil/pressboard interface at the same voltage level; both breakdown voltage and acceleration voltage on ester/pressboard interface are lower than those on mineral oil/pressboard interface at the investigated gap distances up to 75 mm. ?? 2011 IEEE." ],

This debate contests Kim's progressive role in the development of the genre of true scenery painting as well as the extent to which Korean artists utilized European techniques and styles at the end of the eighteenth century. \tIn order to understand whether Kim's painting is truly an anomaly, I examine the development of true scenery painting through two other major figures, Ch&#335;ng S&#335;n (1676-1759) and Kang Sehwang (1713-1776), with special attention as to the extent to which they integrate and expand on tradition. I also compare Kim's album with his set of eight hanging scrolls (ca. 1788) that contain similar techniques, styles, and calligraphic elements. My research indicates that both Ch&#335;ng and Kang were keen innovators in the true-scenery genre, experimenting with many of the European techniques and styles that appear in the Four Districts album. In addition, Kim's set of eight hanging scrolls confirm that he used a similarly detailed style of painting for other commissions and that there may be calligraphic evidence to prove that the contested album is by his same hand. Although the true origin of the album may never be proven, my research indicates that it sits comfortably within the development of true-scenery painting in the eighteenth century as well as Kim's oeuvre of landscape works." ],

  "texts" : [ "Travel-associated sexually transmitted infections: an observational cross-sectional study of the GeoSentinel surveillance database", "BACKGROUND: Travel is thought to be a risk factor for the acquisition of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), but no multicentre analyses have been done. We aimed to describe the range of diseases and the demographic and geographical factors associated with the acquisition of travel-related STIs through analysis of the data gathered by GeoSentinel travel medicine clinics worldwide. \r\nMETHODS: We gathered data from ill travellers visiting GeoSentinel clinics worldwide between June 1, 1996, and Nov 30, 2010, and analysed them to identify STIs in three clinical settings: after travel, during travel, or immigration travel. We calculated proportionate morbidity for each of the three traveller groups and did logistic regression to assess the association between STIs and demographic, geographical, and travel variables. \r\nFINDINGS: Our final analysis was of 112 180 ill travellers-64 335 patients seen after travel, 38 287 patients seen during travel, and 9558 immigrant patients. 974 patients (0·9%) had diagnoses of STIs, and 1001 STIs were diagnosed. The proportionate STI morbidities were 6·6, 10·2, and 16·8 per 1000 travellers in the three groups, respectively. STIs varied substantially according to the traveller category. The most common STI diagnoses were non-gonococcal or unspecified urethritis (30·2%) and acute HIV infection (27·6%) in patients seen after travel; non-gonococcal or unspecified urethritis (21·1%), epididymitis (15·2%), and cervicitis (12·3%) in patients seen during travel; and syphilis in immigrant travellers (67·8%). In ill travellers seen after travel, significant associations were noted between diagnosis of STIs and male sex, travelling to visit friends or relatives, travel duration of less than 1 month, and not having pretravel health consultations. \r\nINTERPRETATION: The range of STIs varies substantially according to traveller category. STI preventive strategies should be particularly targeted at men and travellers visiting friends or relatives. Our data suggest target groups for pretravel interventions and should assist in post-travel screening and decision making. \r\nFUNDING: US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and International Society of Travel Medicine." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Student collaboration and learning : knowledge construction and participation in an asynchronous computer-supported collaborative learning environment in higher education", "Since we moved into the third millennium, there has been a gradual shift from the so-called information society to a networked society. One of the main characteristics of this new society is working in distributed companies and teams. The big challenge for educational systems in a networked society is preparing students for living, working and enjoying themselves in such a society. New advanced information and communication technology (ICT) influences all aspects of human life. One of the main applications of e-learning which captivates and fascinates so many researchers in the field of education is “Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL)”. According to Stahl (2003), CSCL environments are tools designed to support the building of shared knowledge and knowledge negotiation. In CSCL environments students try to learn collaboratively through the Web and they practice working in distributed teams which seems to be a crucial competency for living in a networked society. Although, theoretically, e-learning and CSCL environments are seen as powerful tools for learning processes, the results of empirical research in the field are contradictory. While some research in the field reported low levels of participation, interaction and depth of learning, many studies described and concluded positive effects of CSCL environments, positive effects of face-to-face teaching supported by CSCL applications, and positive effects of CSCL environments applied in combination with face-to-face learning situations.   This dissertation reports a PhD study which concentrated on performing tasks in asynchronous computer-supported collaborative learning environments as a blended learning approach for on-campus students. The blended learning approach, which aims at integrating e-learning techniques and traditional teaching methods, is seen as a way to improve the quality of education and reduce the costs of education for all students. The blended learning approach in higher education is a combination of regular, conventional, face-to-face and individual learning activities with web-based learning activities. It aims at integrating different learning approaches and modes of course material delivery into education. The current PhD project was designed to investigate students’ processes of learning (knowledge construction) and learning outcomes (quality of constructed knowledge) while performing different study tasks in university courses in which CSCL has been implemented. More specifically, the main objective of the study was to investigate the implementation of ACSCL environments in conventional face-to-face and on-campus higher education following a blended learning approach. The following research questions were addressed:  <ol type=\"1\"> <li>What is the current use of e-learning environments in general and CSCL environments in particular in higher education?</li> <li>What is the opinion of teachers about e-learning environments in general and CSCL environments in particular in higher education?</li> <li>What is the opinion of students about implementing tasks in ACSCL environments in higher education?</li> <li>How do students participate in learning processes and knowledge construction while performing tasks in ACSCL environments? </li> <li>How can peer group feedback, supported by ACSCL, improve learning quality and facilitate learning processes?</li> </ol> The dissertation is composed of four different studies which address several specific research questions to investigate different aspects of implementing ACSCL in higher education. The first two studies concern two main parties involved in the process of learning: teachers and students. The third study aims at exploring the process of knowledge construction and quality of learning outcomes while performing tasks in ACSCL environments, and finally, the fourth study is designed to investigate the effect of PGF supported by ACSCL on the process of learning. <b> </b>  <b>Study 1: teachers’ use of e-learning environments</b>   The purpose of the first study was to investigate teachers’ use of e-learning environments as teaching and learning tools in higher education and to explore factors which explain teachers’ use of those e-learning environments. In the study the following research questions were formulated:  1.                  Which functions of e-learning environments do teachers most often use? 2.                  What added value do teachers perceive of e-learning environments? 3.                  Which factors influence teachers’ use of different functions and capabilities of e-learning environments? 4.         What are the barriers for implementing e-learning environments in the learning process?   In e-learning environments, general course information functions (like course calendar and schedule and course announcement and news), content management functions (like presenting course material and literature and PowerPoint presentations) and non-interactive communication functions (like mail and mailing lists) are used most frequently. Other communication functions (like video conferencing, chatting, and voice conferencing) and collaboration functions (like online discussion, online collaboration, shared whiteboard, and application sharing) are the least used features of the e-learning environments.  Comparable to the pattern of the actual use of e-learning environments mentioned above, results indicate that teachers believe that presentation of course materials and literature, presentation of information about the courses, PowerPoint presentations, and E-mail have the most added value for teaching and learning processes. Voice conferencing, shared whiteboard, videoconferencing and net-meetings are believed to have the least added value for teaching and learning processes. The assumed added value of online discussion and online collaboration is low as well. In addition, teachers believe they do not face serious technical problems when working with ICT tools and e-learning environments. Finally, teachers are satisfied with the facilities and connectivity but they feel that they do not have access to relevant software, websites and content.  Running exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis we identified  different factors like Knowledge Construction Teaching and Learning Approach (KC), Teachers’ Opinion about Computer-Assisted Learning (CAL), Teachers’ Opinion about Web-based Activities (WA), Ease of Use (perceived difficulty), and Time which might contribute to the explanation of teachers’ actual use of e-learning environments (USE). We found that a teacher’s previous experience with e-learning environments, WA, CAL, and ease of use can help us to explain teachers’ perceptions of the added value and usefulness of e-learning environments and their actual use of these environments. At the end, we were able to introduce the Teachers’ Use of E-learning Environments Model (USE Model) which consists of Teachers’ Opinions about Web-based Activities (WA) and Teachers’ Opinions about Computer-Assisted Learning (CAL) as predictors, and Teachers’ Perceived Added Value of E-learning Environments (AV) as the mediating variable.    <b>Study 2: Student satisfaction with, and perceived learning effects of, performing tasks in ACSCL environments</b> The second study was aimed at investigating student satisfaction with, and perceived learning effects of, performing asynchronous online collaborative learning tasks in courses in higher education. The specific questions addressed in this study were: 1.                  Are on-campus students satisfied with performing learning tasks in this asynchronous computer-supported collaborative learning environment (ACSCLE)? 2.                  Do on-campus students perceive any added value of performing learning tasks in an asynchronous computer-supported collaborative learning environment (ACSCLE)? 3.                  What factors influence student satisfaction with, and perceived learning in, this asynchronous computer-supported collaborative learning environment (ACSCLE)?   Overall, 61.5% of the students were satisfied with their learning experiences with ACSCLE in their courses and, on average, 43.5% of the students agreed with all the items concerning their satisfaction with different aspects of performing tasks in the ACSCLE; with 45.7% of the students taking a neutral position. From the students’ points of view there were no differences between F2F and asynchronous online collaboration in terms of difficulty of performing tasks and perception of learning. These results led to the conclusion that students evaluate the quality of asynchronous online collaborative learning as equal to the quality of F2F learning. In total, 30.35% of the students positively agreed with all the statements meant to capture their opinions about the learning effects of performing tasks in ACSCLE and 50.35% of them were neutral (Mean=3.12).     <b>Study 3: Students’ learning activities and quality of knowledge construction while performing tasks in ACSCL environments</b> The third study was conducted to explore how on-campus university students in the context of green (food, animal, plant, social and environmental) sciences collaborate and construct knowledge in asynchronous CSCL environments. Therefore, attention was paid to learning activities during the process of knowledge construction. Moreover, we analysed students’ participation and quality of knowledge construction while performing collaborative tasks in asynchronous CSCL environments. The following research questions were addressed with respect to students performing collaborative tasks in asynchronous CSCL environments:  <ol type=\"1\"> <li>To what extent do on-campus students participate in the process of knowledge construction? </li> <li>How can on-campus students’ learning and how can knowledge construction processes be characterised in terms of cognitive, affective, and meta-cognitive learning activities?</li> <li>What is the quality of the constructed knowledge? </li> <li>Are there any changes in on-campus students’ learning activities over time and what are the patterns of those changes?</li> <li>Are there any differences in students’ learning activities in different courses and settings?   </li> </ol>   Considering the fact that, on average, students wrote two notes and read fifty five notes per week, we concluded that students’ active participation in the learning environment was rather/fairly successful and their passive participation was quite successful. We also found that while, on average, each note was read 26.7 times and those contributions written in the first week were read more (Mean =60.4) than notes written in the last weeks (Mean = 5.17). Through content analysis of the students’ written notes and learning activities by means of a coding scheme developed by Veldhuis-Diermanse, 89.2 % of students’ contributions were coded as cognitive learning activities, 8.4 % as meta-cognitive and 2.1 % as affective learning activities. Looking at the subcategories of the coding scheme, we found that ‘debating’ in the cognitive category and ‘keeping clarity’ in the meta-cognitive category appeared more. Another coding scheme was used to assess the quality of students’ contributions. For each of the four quality levels (levels increasing from D to A) corresponding verbs were identified and described. Our findings showed that 75.1 % of students’ contributions were assessed as level B, which is reasonably high, 6.1 % as Level D (lowest quality) and 7.7 % as level A (highest quality) and 11.1 % as level C. Conducting in-depth interviews and focus groups with participants and looking at the open questions of the questionnaire, we concluded that task structure, level of support that students receive, teacher’s role, task complexity, and group composition, which can all be discussed under the term ‘scripting CSCL’, are the main factors that students believed to be important for their learning activities and the quality of their contributions to ACSCL environments.    <b>Study 4: Asynchronous Computer-Supported Peer Group Feedback in Higher Education</b>  In the forth study we concentrated on the application of peer group feedback in face-to-face class meetings and asynchronous computer-supported collaborative learning (ACSCL) environments. More specifically, we surveyed student participation in, satisfaction with, and perceived learning effects of, participating in peer group feedback and studied functions and quality of student contributions to the PGF processes in both F2F and ACS conditions. For this purpose the following research questions were formulated: 1. To what extent do students participate in Peer Group Feedback (PGF) in both Asynchronous Computer-Supported (ACS) and Face to Face (F2F) conditions? 2. What are students' perceptions of the value of Peer Group Feedback (PGF) in both Asynchronous Computer-Supported (ACS) and Face to Face (F2F) conditions? 3. What is the function of the students' feedback in both Asynchronous Computer-Supported (ACS) and Face to Face (F2F) conditions during Peer Group feedback (PGF)?  4. What is the quality of the students' feedback in both Asynchronous Computer-Supported (ACS) and Face to Face (F2F) conditions during Peer Group feedback (PGF)? Our findings revealed that students in the ACS-PGF condition participated more in the process of feedback and all students were active (the distribution was better). In F2F conditions some students took over the discussions and teachers contributed more. The minimum amount of contributions under ACS conditions was much higher than under F2F conditions. We also found that students in both conditions were satisfied with participating in group feedback and perceived PGF as effective for learning. Students in ACS groups were positive, to a higher level, about the quality of PGF and its added value. However, there was no significant difference between students’ perceptions of the effect of PGF on motivation, interaction, and satisfaction.  We found that both ACS and F2F conditions differed with respect to students’ contributions. For example, the students’ notes posted in the ACS groups were significantly clearer, more structured, and more to the point than students’ utterances in F2F groups. Students in ACS conditions posted more notes that were encoded as “evaluation/criticism” and as “motivate/praise” than students in F2F conditions.    <b>Concluding remarks</b> From the study the conclusion can be drawn that although well-arranged technical support and reliable infrastructure are important for teachers’ use of e-learning environments, they are not enough. A teachers’ first experience with using e-learning environments and their attitude toward ICT are more important. Moreover, those who use e-learning environments most frequently use non-interactive and superficial features and functions. Interactive features, like CSCL, are rarely used. It seems that, in practice, more attention has been paid to the technological aspects of e-learning than to the pedagogical aspects and, as a result, these advanced learning environments have only been considered as tools to facilitate traditional learning and teaching approaches. Tasks in CSCL environments need more attention than in face to face collaborative learning. In order to integrate CSCL effectively into the learning process characteristics/issues like structure and the level of structuring of the task, complexity of the learning process, task complexity, the formulation of the task, support that learners receive, and the way that they receive that support are very important. Based on our study the conclusion is justified that, as a blended learning approach, integrating asynchronous CSCL environments can effectively engage students in the process of learning. Implementing tasks in CSCL environments increases students’ participation in learning activities and their interaction with each other and with their teachers outside of class time. We also conclude that asynchronous CSCL does not only foster more students’ participation, but more equal participation, in the learning process and might be used successfully to encourage and engage the silent side of the class into the processes of discussion and collaboration. The results of the study lead us to the conclusion that ACSCL environments can foster higher-order learning skills. However, we should remember that the quality of discussion was significantly related to the design and setting of the course. Learning to work in distributed teams is one of the main competencies that should be developed in higher education to prepare students for working in a knowledge and network society. The findings of this study revealed that performing tasks in asynchronous CSCL environments has the potential to increase the level of participation and interaction among students and to foster processes of shared and social knowledge construction. Performing these kinds of tasks has the potential to provide a meaningful supplement to conventional teaching and learning approaches and can help teachers to overcome the limitations of face-to-face collaboration and discussion.  We conclude that following a blended learning approach and taking course objectives into consideration, we can benefit from the added value of e-learning and CSCL environments. For example, our fourth study revealed that ACSCL can enable teachers to successfully embed ‘formative assessment’ and ‘process-oriented feedback’ (which aims at learning rather than assessment) into the learning process. As stated before, the quality of students’ contributions in groups operating under ACS conditions was significantly higher than in F2F groups and they posted more critical comments. This allows us to conclude that asking students to conduct tasks in CSCL environments and combining these activities within the learning process can improve depth of learning and critical thinking.  It is commonly expected that in ACSCL environments students benefit from “asynchronicity” of the environment. By reading background literature in the field and written course material, and thinking deeply about the topic, students can provide in-depth and well-grounded “delayed feedback”. However our study showed that this is not the normal strategy followed by students. In other words, first we need to learn how students work in ACSCL environments, which is not necessarily as we expect, and second to develop an instructional design and script CSCL activities in a way that persuades students to take advantage of the power of ACSCL environments. Without doing so CSCL environments will lose one of their main advantages over conventional F2F conditions.                                                      " ],

  "texts" : [ "Identification of changes needed in supermarket design for", "Supermarkets use 3% of UK energy. To satisfy building regulations supermarket buildings are modeled in considerable detail. Lighting, occupancy, and small electrical energy impacts are included in this modeling. However, refrigeration energy is not, as it is classified as “process energy” rather than “building related”. Refrigeration energy, which can be very significant, is therefore currently “unregulated” and as a result, heat transfers related to refrigeration cabinets are typically not incorporated in modeling of the building at design stage. This paper explores the comparative energy demands of supermarket stores modeled, using a simple first-order dynamic model, executed on Excel, and “optimized” firstly with, and secondly without, the cooling effect of refrigeration cabinets included in the model. A recently built supermarket is modeled. Results suggest that the energy demand of a new store could be reduced by 15-25% by improvement of the building envelope design with process energy included in the modeling." ],

  "texts" : [ "Crossing borders and industry sectors: Behavioral governance in strategic alliances and product innovation for competitive advantage", "This paper investigates governance mechanisms in international technology alliances (ITAs), firm-level innovation capabilities, and performance outcomes in the mobile computing market. This high-tech market is characterized by numerous cross-border strategic technology collaborations between software and hardware firms. Anchoring our work in interfirm governance theories and the resource-based view, we develop a model and empirically test relationships related to behavioral governance mechanisms, innovation capabilities, and business performance. In the cross-industry and cross-border context, the empirical model explains to what extent complementary strategic resources, through a relational governance mechanism, contribute to the innovation capabilities of high-tech firms, providing competitive advantage. The data, analyzed using partial least squares (PLS) path modeling, indicates that technological commitment is a factor in expediting technology resource exchange in ITAs between heterogeneous firms. Technological commitment is captured by the extent to which a focal firm commits to investing its technology resources in an ITA to maintain the relationship. The results also show that firm-level performance is only influenced by market development capability, and not new product development capability, in product innovation. However, we did not find any significant moderating effects of firm size and industry type on the model. This paper offers insights into how high-tech firms benefit from interfirm governance in international technology resource exchange arrangements. Furthermore, it provides evidence of the methodological usefulness of PLS path modeling in strategic alliance, capability and performance research." ],

  "title" : "Environmental assessment of imported organic products - focusing on orange juice from Brazil and soybeans from China",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Environmental assessment of imported organic products - focusing on orange juice from Brazil and soybeans from China", "The import of organic products to Denmark has seen a four to five fold increase during the last seven years,\r\ndue to a growing demand for organic products. Globally, the market for organic food and drinks has also\r\nmore than doubled during the same period. The global organic agricultural land has concurrently expanded\r\nfrom 26 to 35 million hectares, mostly due to major conversions in Argentina, China, India, Australia, USA\r\nand Brazil. While Europe and North America still makes up the major markets for organic food and drink,\r\nthe extraordinary growth in the organic markets offers export opportunities for both developed and\r\ndeveloping countries. The production and export of organic products in developing countries might offer\r\nboth economic and environmental benefits, though this has mainly been investigated in Europe and North\r\nAmerica. However, long-distance trade with organic products has also given rise to a debate on the\r\nsustainability of this development especially with regard to global warming. Consumers of organic products\r\nmight ask themselves what are the environmental benefits of buying organic products from e.g. South\r\nAmerica or Asia as compared to conventional production and is this outweighed by the long-distance trade?\r\n\r\nThe overall aim of the present PhD study was to assess the environmental impacts of selected imported\r\norganic products from developing countries based on impacts during both production (as compared to\r\nconventional) and during processing and transport to Denmark. Firstly, the global trade, development and\r\noverall environmental impacts of organic agriculture and food systems were investigated to form the\r\nfoundation for the further analysis. Organic soybeans from China and orange juice from Brazil were selected\r\nas relevant case studies. Secondly, environmental life cycle assessments (LCA) were conducted for the case\r\nstudies in China and Brazil focusing on comparing organic with conventional cultivation and on identifying\r\nenvironmental hotspots of the imported organic product during production, processing and transport to\r\nDenmark. Thirdly, LCA was evaluated as a tool for evaluating the environmental soundness of organic\r\nagricultural products and a new methodology on including of soil carbon sequestration in LCA was\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\nThe PhD study shows that the increasing globalization affects both conventional and organic agriculture and\r\nfood systems. Major environmental problems with regard to agriculture and food systems are identified as\r\nglobal warming, nutrient enrichment and pollution of water resources, reductions in biodiversity and soil\r\ndegradation. The growing global trade and development within organic food and farming systems holds a\r\npotential to offer economic and environmental benefits for developing countries, but at the same time holds a\r\nrisk of increasing the environmental load from long-distance transport and of pushing organic food and\r\nagricultural systems toward the conventional farming model and thereby diminishing the environmental\r\nbenefits of organic farming.\r\n\r\nThe case studies in China and Brazil show that the total greenhouse gas emissions associated with imported\r\norganic soybeans from China is 429 kg CO2 eq. per tonne soybean, whereas imported organic orange juice\r\nfrom small-scale farmers in São Paulo, Brazil is 424 g CO2 eq. per litre orange juice. Transport accounts for\r\n50-60% of the total greenhouse gas emissions from the imported organic plant products. As a comparison,\r\ntransport only account for 1-15% for imported meat products, since the greenhouse gas emissions per kg\r\nmeat is a lot higher than for plant products. However, the actual contribution from transport is the same. The\r\nmode of transport is a determining factor in that truck transport has a much higher greenhouse gas emission\r\nper km than sea transport. Thus, sea transport from South America (reloaded to trucks in Rotterdam) is\r\ncomparable to truck transport from Italy and France and lower than truck transport from Spain and sea\r\ntransport from South Africa and China (also reloaded in Rotterdam) in terms of greenhouse gas emissions\r\nper kg imported product. It should be noted that greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural production\r\ncan vary (due to inputs, yields etc.) among countries and in some cases outweigh the emissions from\r\ntransport.\r\n\r\nComparing organic and conventional small-scale production until farm gate in the case studies, greenhouse\r\ngas emissions per kg organic product is found to be 60-75% of a comparable conventional production in the\r\ncase study area. The nutrient enrichment (eutrophication) per kg organic product is 38-82% of a comparable\r\nconventional production whereas land use per kg organic product is 10-13% higher. Higher crop diversity is\r\nfound on small organic compared to small conventional orange farms in Brazil, which may have a positive\r\neffect on biodiversity along with the absence of pesticides and the interrow vegetation. No differences are\r\nfound in biodiversity potential in the Chinese case study except the absence of pesticides. Comparing large\r\nand small organic orange farms in Brazil, greenhouse gas emissions, eutrophication potential and copper use\r\nper hectare is found to be significantly lower on organic small-scale than on large-scale organic orange\r\nplantations.\r\n\r\nThe shortcomings of LCA as a tool for evaluating environmental soundness of agricultural products,\r\nespecially with regards to including biodiversity and soil carbon changes, are discussed. The studies in Brazil\r\nand China find that including estimated soil carbon changes widens the difference in greenhouse gas\r\nemissions per kg product between organic and conventional, but there is a need for methodological\r\ndevelopment on how to estimate and include this. A methodological approach to include soil carbon changes\r\nin LCA is suggested." ],

  "texts" : [ "Social Death: A Grounded Theory Study of the Emotional and Social Effects of Honour Killing on Victims’ Family Members- A Palestinian Family Perspective", "The University of ManchesterAbstract of thesis submitted by Salam Alkhatib on 4 September 2012for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy, entitled:A Grounded Theory Study of the emotional and social effects of honour killing on Victims’ family members- A Palestinian family perspectiveAbstract The murder of women in order to uphold ‘honour’ has occurred throughout history and in many contexts. Despite high rates of domestic violence and increased rates of honour killing over the last decade in Palestine, there is a paucity of empirical data about the phenomenon, the social and cultural forces underlying it and how it affects family members emotionally and socially. The standpoint of this thesis is that Palestinian society today has no solution to honour killing (HK). This study addresses two questions: the factors that contribute to HK, as reported by the participants; and the emotional and social effects and consequences of it. The study adopted a Grounded Theory method. Data were collected using individual and group interviews with family members, professionals and neighbours associated with victims of HK. The total numbers of the participants were 43 (23 family members, 15 professionals and 5 neighbours). A feminist paradigm guided the data collection and analysis. The findings of this study have revealed that the HK phenomenon is multifaceted, grounded in the interplay of several complex factors, including institutionalized patriarchy within society, families and Palestinian culture; honour and shame values in the traditional society and other societal influences (cultural norms and values, legislative and institutional systems). This study therefore concluded that HKs were patriarchal and traditional methods of disempowering and subjugating women, enabled (directly or indirectly) by families, communities, political parties, religious leaders, professionals and the state, rendering society at large as unlikely to condemn honour killing. The main result was that although family members killed their female relatives primarily in an attempt to re-establish their honour, the murder failed in this purpose and in fact made their situation worse. Understanding this significant finding gives a clear message to family members and to the public that honour killing harms perpetrators emotionally and further damages family honour, where enter into a long process which ultimately leads to social death. Thus, multiple efforts are needed to combat HK, but this is extremely difficult. Altering the attitudes and behaviour of those who believe in HK is not an easy task but one of the first and crucial steps in combating this issue is state action. This study shows that most participants, especially family members, were concerned about family reputation and endeavoured to resolve problems within the family. This makes solving the problems inside families more difficult for any external party. Therefore, it is necessary to find ways to work with families. Further research has the potential to increase our understanding of other social factors and processes involved in honour killing, which would enable concerned parties to better craft effective intervention strategies." ],

  "texts" : [ "Time trends in coroners' use of different verdicts for possible suicides and their impact on officially reported incidence of suicide in England: 1990-2005.", "BACKGROUND: Official suicide statistics for England are based on deaths given suicide verdicts and most cases given an open verdict following a coroner's inquest. Previous research indicates that some deaths given accidental verdicts are considered to be suicides by clinicians. Changes in coroners' use of different verdicts may bias suicide trend estimates. We investigated whether suicide trends may be over- or underestimated when they are based on deaths given suicide and open verdicts. Method Possible suicides assessed by 12 English coroners in 1990/91, 1998 and 2005 and assigned open, accident/misadventure or narrative verdicts were rated by three experienced suicide researchers according to the likelihood that they were suicides. Details of all suicide verdicts given by these coroners were also recorded. RESULTS: In 1990/91, 72.0% of researcher-defined suicides received a suicide verdict from the coroner, this decreased to 65.4% in 2005 (p trend < 0.01); equivalent figures for combined suicide and open verdicts were 95.4% (1990/91) and 86.7% (2005). Researcher-defined suicides with a verdict of accident/misadventure doubled over that period, from 4.6% to 9.1% (p < 0.01). Narrative verdict cases rose from zero in 1990/91 to 25 in 2005 (4.2% of researcher-defined suicides that year). In 1998 and 2005, 50.0% of the medicine poisoning deaths given accidental/misadventure verdicts were rated as suicide by the researchers. CONCLUSIONS: Between 1990/91 and 2005, the proportion of researcher-defined suicides given a suicide verdict by coroners decreased, largely due to an increased use of accident/misadventure verdicts, particularly for deaths involving poisoning. Consideration should be given to the inclusion of 'accidental' deaths by poisoning with medicines in the statistics available for monitoring suicides rates." ],

An example of such relationship is that of the interaction between area deprivation and individual ethnicity on reports of self-rated health, which we explored using cross-sectional data from the 2007 Citizenship Survey linked to the 2001 UK census. We aimed to examine whether the association between area deprivation and poor self-rated health differs for ethnic minority groups, as compared to white British people. Following from this, we also examined whether possible differential associations were mediated by ethnic density effects and perceptions of and satisfaction with neighbourhood characteristics. Results of random effects multilevel logistic regression models showed the detrimental association between area deprivation and self-rated health to be of greater magnitude and stronger for white British people than for ethnic minority people. This differential association was not mediated by ethnic density effects or perceptions of and satisfaction with neighbourhood characteristics." ],

  "texts" : [ "Design and analysis of non-pharmacological treatment trials with multiple therapists per patient", "In trials of physical and talking therapies, nesting of patients within therapists has statistical implications analogous to those of cluster randomised trials. Nevertheless, the clustering effect may be more complex, as it interacts with treatment. For some therapies, individual patients may receive care from multiple therapists of the same type, so that patients are no longer strictly nested within therapists, creating a ‘multiple-membership’ relationship between patients and therapists.This paper considers methods of analysis and sample size estimation for trials with multiple-membership clustering effects. It is motivated by a trial of a psychotherapy for the treatment of adolescent depression with cognitive behavioural therapy. We tested methods and issues in a Monte Carlo simulation study, simulating trials with multiple membership. Results demonstrate satisfactory performance in terms of convergence and give estimates of the intra-cluster correlation coefficient and empirical test size similar to a simple hierarchical design.We derive formulae for sample size and power for multiple-membership trial designs. We then compare estimates of power from this formula with empirical power derived from the simulation study. Finally, we show that we can easily extend formulae for sample size and power to allow consideration of power and sample size for certain types of more complex interventions. These include situations where therapists of different types deliver separate components of the intervention, creating a cross-classified relationship, or where several therapists deliver a group-administered treatment, creating further levels.

  "texts" : [ "High prevalence of lipoatrophy in pre-pubertal South African children on antiretroviral therapy: a cross-sectional study", "Abstract\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBackground\n\t\t\t\tDespite changes in WHO guidelines, stavudine is still used extensively for treatment of pediatric HIV in the developing world. Lipoatrophy in sub-Saharan African children can be stigmatizing and have far-reaching consequences. The severity and extent of lipoatrophy in pre-pubertal children living in sub-Saharan Africa is unknown.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMethods\n\t\t\t\tIn this cross-sectional study, children who were 3-12 years old, on antiretroviral therapy and pre-pubertal were recruited from a Family HIV Clinic in South Africa. Lipoatrophy was identified and graded by consensus between two HIV pediatricians using a standardized grading scale. A professional dietician performed formal dietary assessment and anthropometric measurements of trunk and limb fat. Previous antiretroviral exposures were recorded. In a Dual-Energy X-ray Absorbtiometry (DXA) substudy body composition was determined in 42 participants.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tResults\n\t\t\t\tAmong 100 recruits, the prevalence of visually obvious lipoatrophy was 36% (95% CI: 27%&#8211;45%). Anthropometry and DXA measurements corroborated the clinical diagnosis of lipoatrophy: Both confirmed significant, substantial extremity fat loss in children with visually obvious lipoatrophy, when adjusted for age and sex. Adjusted odds ratio for developing lipoatrophy was 1.9 (95% CI: 1.3 - 2.9) for each additional year of accumulated exposure to standard dose stavudine. Cumulative time on standard dose stavudine was significantly associated with reductions in biceps and triceps skin-fold thickness (p=0.008).\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConclusions\n\t\t\t\tThe prevalence of visually obvious lipoatrophy in pre-pubertal South African children on antiretroviral therapy is high. The amount of stavudine that children are exposed to needs review. Resources are needed to enable low-and-middle-income countries to provide suitable pediatric-formulated alternatives to stavudine-based pediatric regimens. The standard stavudine dose for children may need to be reduced. Diagnosis of lipoatrophy at an early stage is important to allow timeous antiretroviral switching to arrest progression and avoid stigmatization. Diagnosis using visual grading requires training and experience, and DXA and comprehensive anthropometry are not commonly available. A simple objective screening tool is needed to identify early lipoatrophy in resource-limited settings where specialized skills and equipment are not available." ],

Currently, the majority of cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage when surgical resection is not feasible. Screening for lung cancer has been a major focus of research for the last 40 years. Despite this, there is still a lack of evidence to promote its use outside clinical trials. More recently, interest has focused on promoting earlier recognition of symptomatic disease among both the general public and primary care physicians in order to encourage more timely investigation and referral to secondary care. The hope is that this approach may increase the proportion of disease identified in the early tages, allowing more surgical resections and improved five-year survival rates.

  "texts" : [ "Biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and metabolism of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) using [¹⁸F]-IL1RA and PET imaging in rats.", "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Positron emission tomography (PET) has the potential to improve our understanding of the preclinical pharmacokinetics and metabolism of therapeutic agents, and is easily translated to clinical studies in humans. However, studies involving proteins radiolabelled with clinically relevant PET isotopes are currently limited. Here we illustrate the potential of PET imaging in a preclinical study of the biodistribution and metabolism of ¹⁸F-labelled IL-1 receptor antagonist ([¹⁸F]IL-1RA) using a novel [¹⁸F]-radiolabelling technique. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: IL-1RA was radiolabelled by reductive amination on lysine moieties with [¹⁸F]fluoroacetaldehyde. Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intravenously with [¹⁸F]IL-1RA and imaged with a PET camera for 2 h. For the study of IL-1RA metabolites by ex vivoγ-counting of samples, rats were killed 20 min, 1 h or 2 h after injection of [¹⁸F]IL-1RA. KEY RESULTS: [¹⁸F]IL-1RA distribution into the major organs of interest was as follows: kidneys > liver > lungs > brain. In lungs and liver, [¹⁸F]IL-1RA uptake peaked within 1 min post-injection then decreased rapidly to reach a plateau from 10 min post-injection. In the brain, the uptake exhibited slower pharmacokinetics with a smaller post-injection peak and a plateau from 6 min onward. IL-1RA was rapidly metabolized and these metabolites represented ∼40% of total activity in plasma and ∼80% in urine, 20 min after injection. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Preclinical PET imaging is a feasible method of assessing the biodistribution of new biological compounds of therapeutic interest rapidly. The biodistribution of [¹⁸F]IL-1RA reported here is in agreement with an earlier study suggesting low uptake in the normal brain, with rapid metabolism and excretion via the kidneys." ],

  "texts" : [ "From Orientalism to Japonisme: Hugo, Baudelaire and Mallarme", "In nineteenth-century France, both Orientalism and Japonisme were heralded as ways to rejuvenate art and literature. Did these movements actually \"modernize\" the arts? This thesis visualizes the esthetics of the Orientalist poetry of Hugo, Baudelaire and Mallarme through a parallel study of nineteenth-century Orientalist painting. The results of these Orientalist analyses are compared to the esthetic effects of the movement of Japonisme found in painting and in Mallarme's poetry.Hugo, in Les Orientales, communicates in a linear, rational and metonymic style of representation which merely perpetuates Western literary convention. This resembles the painting of the French neo-classicists and academic realists such as Gerome. These artists, like Hugo, paint a \"realistic\" portrait of \"Oriental\" reality which blatantly coincides with the poet's desire to demonstrate his artistic virility.Baudelaire's poetry moves towards the Impressionistic ideal while still remaining (like Delacroix) in the French Romantic tradition. His images transcend the delineated linear rational reality. His personal use and distortion of metaphor disrupts the rational interpretative process of the reader which anticipates twentieth century Western art and literature.Mallarme, like many of his contemporaries, realized the relativity of Western ideals of beauty. An analysis of certain poems reveal his use of Orientalism and Japonisme which demonstrates the nineteenth century search for fresh inspiration. However, unlike earlier poets and painters, Mallarme succeeds in breaking out of tradition--much like those artists incorporating Japanese artistic techniques into their art.Mallarme relies on the universal essence of language that strips all referential connotations in order to leave the reader with nothing but its enigmatic essence. An analysis of Mallarme' s later poetry reveals a resemblance to the esthetics of Zen art wherein lies Mallarme's literary japonsime, and wherein perhaps lies another way to interpret the change in consciousness in many artists, readers, spectators and/or scientists of the time whose perception of the world was changing and whose poetic and artistic representations help us to visualize the transformation of their inner reality and its relationship to the outer world" ],

  "texts" : [ "Solving PDEs with random data by stochastic collocation", "In many science and engineering problems there is uncertainty in the input data. The ability to suitably model and handle this uncertainty is crucial for obtaining meaningful information about solutions. In this thesis, we consider the numerical approximation of statistics of solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) with uncertain inputs. We focus on PDEs with random coefficients and random domains.We consider a general set of numerical methods known collectively as stochastic finite element methods. We can distinguish stochastic Galerkin methods and stochastic sampling methods. For the latter, samples of the random inputs are generated and the deterministic PDE is solved for each one. Averages of the quantities of interest are calculated using solutions obtained from the samples. We focus in particular on a specific type of sampling method, the stochastic collocation method.The main computational cost associated with solving PDEs with random data using stochastic finite element methods is the solution of the resulting linear system(s) obtained from the fully discrete problem. The main aim in this thesis is to identify efficient and robust techniques for solving the sequence of linear systems obtained from stochastic collocation methods and to reduce the computational costs by recycling as much information as possible. New iterative solution strategies are presented for stochastic collocation discretisations of PDEs with random coefficients and for stochastic collocation discretisations of PDEs on random domains. Substantial savings on computing costs have been demonstrated." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Apolonia Dangzalan: Filipina Businesswoman, Watsonville, California", "Apolonia Dangzalan, a Filipino resident of Watsonville, California, was interviewed on April 27, 1977 by Meri Knaster, an editor at the Regional History Project, as part of a series of oral histories documenting local agricultural and ethnic history. Dangzalan was born in February 1896 in San Nicolas, Ilocos Sur, northwest of Manila, on the largest of the Philippine islands. Her family owned some land on which rice and corn was cultivated by sharecroppers. Her uncle was the president of San Nicholas. Dangzalan attended school for five years but was unable to continue due to illness. Her father died when she was five years old and her mother died when she was seventeen. In 1923, at age 27, she married. A year later she and her husband immigrated to Oahu, Hawaii. Her husband worked in the sugar cane fields and Dangzalan began a small business in her house sewing clothes for the Filipino community. This was the first of many small businesses she would run throughout her long life. In 1925 she and her husband moved to San Francisco, and then to Stockton, California, where her husband worked as a laborer in the asparagus fields.\n      Dissatisfied with her marriage, in 1926 Dangzalan divorced her husband and moved to Marysville, California, where she bought and managed a pool hall and restaurant frequented by Filipinos, Mexicans and Anglo Americans. Although she enjoyed this work, business was not too good. She heard that Watsonville and Salinas were much better places to be in business because they attracted a large Filipino community that came to work in the fruit orchards. So after five months in Marysville, Dangzalan joined her nephew, Frank Barba, in Watsonville, California. (Frank Barba is also the subject of an oral history published by the Regional History Project.) Dangzalan opened a boarding house for Filipino agricultural workers on Bridge Street in Watsonville, California, where she became known as \"Mama\" Dangzalan. After a few years, her nephew, Frank Barba, took over the Watsonville boarding house and Dangzalan opened another boarding house on Salinas Road in 1930. Most of the workers she housed were working for the Gary Company, and Dangzalan also served as a labor contractor, hiring men to work in the company's fields. Dangzalan was one of very few women engaged in labor contracting.\n      Dangzalan engaged in diverse business activities besides labor contracting. She also opened a liquor store, dancing club, and pool hall on Main Street in Watsonville in 1936. During World War II she owned a house of prostitution on Union Street in Watsonville. She hired an American woman to manage it for her.\n      In 1950 Dangzalan stopped working as a labor contractor and went into business for herself as a farmer, primarily growing strawberries. After four years of this she was tired. In 1952 Dangzalan was operated on for kidney cancer. She withdrew from all of her businesses except for the International Groceries and Liquors store on lower Main Street, which she was still running at the time of this oral history interview in 1977. At age 81 Dangzalan was still working in the liquor store until 2:30 in the morning. In her field notes, interviewer Meri Knaster described Dangzalan as \"a very spry and active eighty-one year old\". Dangzalan continued to operate the liquor store until 1982. She died in 1992, at the age of 96." ],

Only recently has thesupply chain in China become integrated into the global product innovation cycle.While innovations generated by supply channel relationships, as opposed to individualpartners, are playing an increasingly important role in the success of all supply chainpartners, there has been limited research in the literature on how supply chainrelationships cultivate the process of such innovation generation, particularly inChina.Correspondingly, this study explores how multinational suppliers can developadaptive product innovation in order to create a sustainable competitive advantage inChina and how the protection of their knowledge helps them sustain it. Drawing onthe knowledge-based view and transaction cost economics, and integrating those withbehavioural governance and the institution-based view this study identifies drivers ofproduct innovation for MNC suppliers in their relationships with Chinese OEMs,investigates the influence of supplier involvement and knowledge protection onsupplier product innovation and examines the outcomes in the specific context of theChinese automotive industry from the first-tier supplier perspective. Survey results of170 multinational automobile suppliers in China indicate support for most of thehypotheses.Specifically, knowledge protection is found to have an impact on product innovationin the context of the auto industry in China. Supplier involvement in co-design andco-development with an automotive OEM customer has an inverted U-shapedrelationship with product innovation. Furthermore, trust and technological uncertaintyare found to drive greater product innovation. In addition, the institutionalenvironment moderates the effect of product innovation on performance.Overall, this study enhances the understanding of how MNC suppliers can acquirelocal knowledge, develop products adapted to the local market requirements andfoster product innovation while retaining their knowledge and know-how andminimizing negative effects of spill-overs to the local competition in the automotiveindustry in China." ],

A MANCOVA was performed to predict distress and cancer-specific quality of life at 12 weeks post-consultation based on control variables (patient age, education, residence, tumor size (breast sample), gleason score (prostate sample), and receipt of an initial treatment consultation recording), predictor variables (treatment type--chemotherapy, hormone therapy, radiation therapy; decisional role--active, collaborative, passive), and interactions between these predictors.RESULTS: Women who received chemotherapy and reported having played a more passive role in treatment decision making had significantly greater distress and lower cancer-specific quality of life at 12-week post-consultation. There were no statistically significant predictors of these outcomes identified for men with prostate cancer.CONCLUSION: Receipt of chemotherapy places women with breast cancer at risk for distress and reduced quality of life, but only for the subset of women who report playing a passive role in treatment decision making. Prospective, longitudinal studies are needed to confirm the present findings and to explicate the antecedents, composition, and consequences of the 'passive' decisional role during the treatment phase of the cancer trajectory." ],

We focus on Chelsea, Massachusetts, because it is a dense city, dominated by multifamily housing structures with high rates of foreclosure for which we have particularly good data. We distinguish between occupant-owners and investors using local data, and we find that many investors are misclassified as occupant-owners in the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data. Then, employing a competing risks framework to study ownerships during the period 1998 through mid-2010, we find that local investors, who tend to invest more in relation to purchase prices and sell more quickly, experienced approximately 1.8 times the mortgage foreclosure risk of occupant-owners, conditional on financing. Nonlocal investors have no statistically significant difference in foreclosure risk from occupant-owners. Nonetheless, those owners with subprime purchase mortgages (most of whom are occupant-owners) faced the highest foreclosure risk when house prices fell." ],

  "texts" : [ "Role of CCL11 in eosinophilic lung disease during respiratory syncytial virus infection.", "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major viral pathogen of infants and the elderly. Significant morbidity is caused by an overexuberant mixed lung cell infiltrate, which is thought to be driven by chemokines. One of the main chemotactic mediators responsible for the movement of eosinophils is CCL11 (eotaxin). Using a mouse model of eosinophilic bronchiolitis induced by RSV, we show here that treatment in vivo with a blocking antibody to CCL11 greatly reduces lung eosinophilia and disease severity. In addition, anti-CCL11 caused a striking inhibition of CD4-T-cell influx and shifted cytokine production away from interleukin-5 without reducing the resistance to viral replication. These results suggest that in addition to influencing eosinophil diapedesis and survival, anti-CCL11 has an action on T cells. These studies strengthen the case for anti-CCL11 treatment of Th2-driven diseases." ],

It is very important to understand its meaning and importance in all human reactions in order to be able to understand the world and deal with the difficulties of life. The purpose of this study is to distinguish and to make apparent the terms of religiosity and spirituality in a general population in Thessaly.Design/participants: In order to have a reliable tool of measurement of spirituality and religiosity in Greece it was used “The Royal Free Interview for Religious and Spiritual Beliefs” questionnaire. In the study, 393 Greek citizens, living in Thessaly, completed the questionnaire, generally. The choice of the sample was at random, via place of work, homes and hospitals in the area of Thessaly.Measurements/ results: The average age of participants was 36,39 years, 149 (37,9%) were men and 244 were women in a percentage of 62,1%. Moreover, 95, 9% of the sample stated that they were Christians Orthodox. It was found that in a percentage of 57,7%, the participants have as much of spiritual and religious understanding of their lives in a relevance of a 11,7 of those people who have only spiritual understanding.Ιt was  also, found that, people who have a high understanding of spirituality and religiosity had higher scores in the practice of faith in contrast to those who had only a spiritual understanding. It was also interesting that those who demonstrated both religious and spiritual understanding declared that they believe there is a spiritual power or force above them influencing the international facts. This was not the case with the participants who declared only religious beliefs. 85% stated that praying plays an important role in their lives. Sixteen people stated that they have experienced a situation related to death while 165 were certain that we exist in some kind of form after death.Conclusions: Findings from this study indicate that religion and spirituality are significant and fulfilling in the lives of the participants.

They were originally designed for gene expression profiling in relatively simple biological systems, such as cell lines and model systems under constant laboratory conditions. This poses a challenge to ecologists who increasingly want to use microarrays to unravel the genetic mechanisms underlying complex interactions among organisms and between organisms and their environment. Here, we discuss typical experimental and statistical problems that arise when analyzing genome-wide expression profiles in an ecological context. We show that experimental design and environmental confounders greatly influence the identification of candidate genes in ecological microarray studies, and that following several simple recommendations could facilitate the analysis of microarray data in ecological settings. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Chemical dynamics and bonding at gas/semiconductor and oxide/semiconductor interfaces", "Gas and oxide adsorption and their impact on the properties of semiconductor interfaces were investigated at the atomic level with both experimental and theoretical techniques. Two types of semiconductors were studied, an organic semiconductor, employed in chemical field effect transistors (chemFETs) and alternative channel materials for metal oxide field effect transistors (MOSFETs). Adsorption of nitric oxide (NO) on iron phthalocyanine (FePc), an organic semiconductor, was explored to determine the adsorption mechanism of NO. King and Wells sticking measurements were performed on ordered monolayer, multilayer FePc and quasi-amorphous tetra-t-butyl FePc multilayer thin films to determine the impact of surface order and thickness on adsorption. Density functional theory (DFT) results show there is a deep chemisorption well at the metal center. The metal centers are a small fraction of the surface (3%), but the initial sticking probability was 40% at low surface temperature and low incident beam energy. Both the experimental and theoretical data supports molecular NO sticking onto FePc via physisorption to the aromatic periphery followed by diffusion to the Fe metal center, a multiple pathway precursor-mediated chemisorption. To understand the chemical dynamics of bonding at the oxide/semiconductor interface, the adsorption of oxygen, nitrogen, and high- [kappa] dielectrics onto alternative high mobility channel materials, Ge and InAs, was investigated to identify passive oxide/semiconductor interfaces via DFT. DFT modeling of experimental results found oxygen exposure on Ge(0 0 1)-(4 x 2) pins the Fermi level near the valence band due to generation of Ge ad-atoms and formation of a suboxide. Similarly, DFT modeling demonstrated that the nitrided Ge(001) surface was pinned due to generation of Ge ad-atoms and formation of a subnitride. For III-V materials, a comparison was made of the geometric and electronic structures of ordered HfO₂ and ZrO₂ monolayers on InAs(0 0 1)-(4 x 2). DFT calculations showed that both high-k oxides were able to electronically passivate the InAs(0 0 1)-(4 x 2) surface, decreasing density of states at the Fermi level by removal of dangling bonds and strained bonds on the semiconductor substrate. With a greater atomic understanding of the oxide-semiconductor interfaces, the presented results can help guide future device engineering efforts" ],

  "texts" : [ "Antimony and acetaldehyde migration from Nigerian and British PET bottles into water and soft drinks under typical use conditions. Concentration of migrants and some trace elements in polyethylene terephthalate and in bottled contents.", "Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is an excellent material for bottling water, beverages, edible oils and other liquids because it is light, tough and transparent. PET bottles are also extensively reused for storage of drinking water, beverages and other liquids and for solar disinfection of microbiologically unsafe drinking water in the tropics. In spite of the usefulness of PET bottles earlier works have reported leaching of antimony and acetaldehyde from the bottle matrix into the liquid contents. Both antimony trioxide and acetaldehyde belongs to Group 2B (possible carcinogens) in the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) carcinogen classification. Additionally acetaldehyde associated with alcoholic beverages (derived from alcoholic beverage and formed endogenously) has recently been upgraded to IARC Group 1 carcinogen (carcinogenic to humans).\nThe research aims to assess the pattern and extent of antimony and acetaldehyde migration from British and Nigerian polyethylene terephthalate bottles into bottle contents under typical use and reuse conditions. The research compares the assessed extents of migration with the current regulations to determine whether the maximum acceptable levels of antimony and acetaldehyde are being exceeded and whether current regulations might need to be reassessed. \nTo achieve these goals the pattern and extent of PET bottle use and reuse in Britain and Nigeria were appraised through survey. The survey revealed that new bottles with contents are typically stored prior to use for periods ranging between one and 7 days, with Nigerians storing for longer periods than British respondents. However storage of up to one year was reported. The extent of bottle reuse was high and similar for the two countries.  Nevertheless Nigerian respondents reuse bottles for longer periods than British respondents. The survey findings together with relevant literature were used to design laboratory experiments that assessed the extent of antimony and acetaldehyde migration from PET bottles into water/beverages. \nA total of 82 brands of bottled water and soft drinks in plastic and glass bottles and in cartons were collected. A few samples from Nigeria in plastic pouches were collected. Materials used in bottling including glass and plastic bottle materials, metal and plastic bottle cap materials and plastic cap lining materials were collected. All samples were collected in supermarkets and shops in Britain and Nigeria except drinking water from taps which was collected in Britain only. Some bottles were aged for the purpose of studying the impact of bottle aging on chemical migration. Other bottles were stored with their contents to study the impact of long term storage of bottle contents on chemical migration.\nEnergy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterise PET bottle material and other materials associated with water and soft drink bottling. Antimony and other trace metals in water and soft drinks were determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Antimony content of PET and other plastics was determined by microwave digestion and ICP-MS. Acetaldehyde content of water and soft drinks and PET were determined using headspace gas chromatography with flame ionisation detection (GC-FID). Accuracy and precision for determination of antimony and other trace elements in bottle materials and bottle contents were good as recoveries were around 100% and coefficients of variation were less than 15% for all analysis types. Accuracy and precision for determination of acetaldehyde in bottle materials and bottle contents were also good as recoveries were around 100% and coefficients of variation were less than 15% for all analysis types. Impact of long term storage, elevated temperatures, bottle thickness, carbonation, bottle aging and bottle size on migration of antimony and acetaldehyde were also assessed. \nAll plastic bottle materials analysed were found to be PET. Bottle cap materials were either polyethylene or polypropylene. All plastic cap lining materials from Britain and some from Nigeria were found to be ethylene vinyl acetate/polypropylene copolymer. Plastic cap lining materials from some Nigerian soft drinks were identified as polyvinyl chloride. Glass bottle materials analysed were found to be soda-lime glass. Metal bottle caps were identified as tinplate, tin-free-steel coated with chromium or aluminium coated with chromium.\nThe antimony concentration in 32 PET bottle materials from Britain and Nigeria were similar and ranged between 177 and 310 mg/kg with an average of 250±30 mg/kg. The concentration agrees well with the industry reported concentration of between 150 and 350 mg/kg. The concentration of residual acetaldehyde in 25 fresh PET bottle materials from Britain and Nigeria ranged between 0.95 and 12.52 µg/g. The average concentration in British and Nigerian soft drinks PET materials are 4.76 and 2.17µg/g respectively. Concentration of residual acetaldehyde was higher in soft drinks and still water PET materials than in sparkling water materials. The concentration of residual acetaldehyde decreases as the bottle wall material becomes older. Also the thinner the bottle walls the lower the concentration of residual acetaldehyde. \nAntimony concentration in 47 freshly purchased British bottled water and soft drinks ranged between 0.03 and 6.61µg/L with only one sample going above the EU acceptable limit. Concentrations of other trace elements measured were low except titanium which was detected at part per million levels in soft drinks. Lead content of a Nigerian soft drink in glass bottle stored for 2 months was above the EU acceptable limit for lead. At realistic temperatures of 40 and 60°C antimony concentration in the water remained below the EU acceptable limit even after 48 hours of exposure but the concentration exceeded the limit for most exposures at 80°C. Concentration of antimony in some Nigerian bottled water and soft drinks was above the EU limit after 11 months of storage at room temperature. Aged bottles leach lower amount of antimony than new bottles. Similarly larger bottles leach lower amount of antimony than smaller bottles. \nThe average acetaldehyde concentrations found in British fruit juices, carbonated soft drinks, sparkling water and still water were 5113, 1458, 22 and 8 µg/L respectively. Acetaldehyde was not detected in water bottled in glass. The concentration of acetaldehyde in five fruit juice samples in PET bottles and carton was beyond the EU specific migration limit (SML) of 6mg/kg. Also the tolerable daily intake of acetaldehyde could be exceeded as a result of intake of some soft drinks and fruit juices. Acetaldehyde content in soft drinks increase with storage but the increase cannot be accounted for by the residual acetaldehyde in PET. Acetaldehyde was found to be outgassing from some bottles. It was also found to be capable of migrating from soft drinks into bottle wall. Without replenishment the concentration of acetaldehyde in solution decreases with time.\nThe use of PVC cap lining in Nigeria as found in this study is a cause for concern as PVC is associated with health risk issues. The study recommends actions to ensure that antimony in fruit juices and other bottled products remain within the regulatory standard from bottling to consumption for the purpose of safeguarding the health of consumers. Glass used in bottling should be well scrutinized to ensure that it does not contain high levels of lead or other chemical substances that can cause harm to consumers through migration into contents. PET bottles can safely be used for solar water disinfection without the risk of antimony intake at concentrations above safe limits as water temperature achievable as the result of the technique doesn¿t go beyond 60°C. Also aged bottles are safer to use than new bottles because their chemical leaching was found to be lower than that of new bottles. This study recommends the reassessment of the absence of international guidelines for acetaldehyde in water and foods. The study also recommends that the amount of acetaldehyde that can be added to soft drinks as flavouring agent should be below the specific migration limit (SML) for migration of acetaldehyde from PET bottle into bottle contents. This is essential since the SML was designed to ensure that exposure to acetaldehyde, as a result of intake of bottled water and soft drinks in PET bottles, is below the tolerable daily intake (TDI) for acetaldehyde. As antimony was reported to go beyond the safe limits in some Nigerian bottled water and soft drinks after 11 months of storage this study discourages the use of bottle contents stored for a very long time.Commonwealth Scholarship Commission in the United Kingdo" ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Religious and political leadership in Persian Baluchistan: a study in the confusion of temporal and spiritual authority", "<p>1. The aim of the thesis is threefold:<ul><li>i) to present a fully dynamic analysis of leadership among the Baluch in the Persian Province of Baluchistan,</li><li>ii) to illustrate the sociological distinction (or lack of it) between sacré and profane on different planes in the society,</li><li>iii) to make some advance in the theoretical treatment of personality as a sociological factor in leadership.</li></ul></p><p>2. The Baluch in general form a linguistic and sub-cultural unit within the broader cultural context of Eastern or Iranian Islam. The Persian Province of Baluchistan, which is roughly coterminous with the area of Persia where the Baluch form the majority of the population, is an isolated area which presents great extremes of altitude, climate and fertility. Natural conditions break the society down into small communities (whether settled or nomadic), and force it into dependence on a combination of agriculture and pastoralism in varying proportions. In almost every aspect of the material culture utter simplicity and dependence on the environment is evident. However, complex patterns of movement and other sociological factors keep all communities and classes constantly in touch with each other, and counteract the fragmenting effect of the the environment.</p><p>Baluch society within the Province consists of:<ul><li>i) Balush - who are predominantly nomadic,</li><li>ii) shahri - who are generally peasants,</li><li>iii) ghulāms - who until recently were slaves, and</li><li>iv) a superstructure of dynastic families, for which however there is no native term.</li></ul></p><p>From the point of view of leadership, there are also four role-statuses:<ul><li>i) kamāsh - who may be secular or religious,</li><li>ii) maulawi - who is religious,</li><li>iii) darwish - who is also religious, and</li><li>iv) \"chief\" - who is secular, and for which there is no really equivalent native term.</li></ul></p><p>Political aspirations invariably function through one or other of these role-statuses, which however cannot be said to form a structure. A chief must be a member of a dynastic family, and is a leader by definition. Holders of the other three role-statuses are only potentially leaders: they may or may not lead in fact. The chief is generally but not necessarily more powerful than holders of the other role-statuses.</p><p>Every man inherits a tribal name agnatically, and the word for tribe (zāt) is best translated as \"birth status\". However, the zāt of a man's mother is also an important factor in determining his status. He may only improve his status within limits by his own achievements. There are also institutionalised forms of behaviour for particular occasions and situations, and there is a \"formal\" religion - Islam.</p><p>Beyond these factors there is no institutionalisation in the society, and so there is practically no specifically political institutionalisation at all. Furthermore, the terms for the three role-statuses which are named in the society are all of alien origin.</p><p>3. This situation makes it impossible to understand and analyse realistically the present framework of political conceptions in the society without taking cognisance both of the history of these conceptions and of comparative material from neighbouring societies, for all of these conceptions have at least archaistic aspects, and in some respects contact with the semantic origin of the term still conditions its use within the society.</p><p>In general, a zāt represents a group of immigrants to the Province. The people who brought the name \"Baluch\" and the Baluchi language into the Province appear to have arrived there in the 11th century. There is evidence that agriculture flourished in the Province before the Baluch came, but we know nothing of any pastoral life there before them. The names of the main agricultural settlements were the same before the Baluch came as they are now. There are no other pre-Baluch names in the Province.</p><p>On the basis of the historical and comparative data available a theoretical model is constructed to demonstrate the synchronic and diachronic contexts of the present situation. This model is particularly relevant to the study of:<ul><li>i) relationships between settled and nomadic and the mixture of various ethnic, cultural, and linguistic groups</li><li>ii) the ways in which social stratification may result from such mixtures</li><li>iii) how certain political relationships - particularly the feudal relationship - may develop in these circumstances, and</li><li>iv) how the constellation and importance of kin and affinal relationships may be affected.</li></ul></p><p>4. The kinship terminology is simple and cognatic. There are strong ties between brother and sister, and between cousins. Brothers and sisters generally inherit equal shares of land, except that the eldest son may be given an extra share. Livestock is gnerally inherited by sons only. Landownership is only of secondary importance to leadership. Marriage preference (for first or only wives) is for \"cousins\", and the bride-price is high and not affected by the choice of a father's brother's daughter. Some communities and classes are generally monogamous, others generally polygymous, and it is possible to discern a difference in the function and conception of marriage in the two cases. Matri- and patri-locality is better interpreted in terms of the fact that solidary political groupings (formed by marriage or allegiance) are generally more important sociologically than geographical and seological groupings. Among the nomadic Baluch a corollary of the orientation towards kinship, tribal affiliation, etc., is the instability of the individual camp. Marriage and inheritance practices reinforce \"class\" identity - particularly in the dynastic families where this identity is most important. Similarly, because of these practices, members of dynastic families acquire ownership interests in widely scattered pieces of land, and are therefore encouraged to move about continually.</p><p>5. The dynastic families form a superstructure. The chief is generally the paramount leader in a certain area, and has a certain vaguely defined \"people\". There are communities and areas without chiefs. Holders of the other role-statuses may also function as paramount leaders. Any leader automatically qualifies for one or other of the traditional role-statuses. This essay is concerned primarily with the chief who is seen (by the Baluch) as the most typical form of paramount leader but for whom nevertheless there is no native term. The main functions of the leader are to provide social control and initiative, but he also personifies the prestige of the community.</p><p>A chief (or other leader) rules generally through kenash, who form the basic political denominators of the society. Neither is directly chosen or elected by the other. The extent of a leader's power depends basically on two factors:<ul><li>i) his \"ecological\" situation, i.e. parentage, alliance, etc.</li><li>ii) his \"personality\",</li></ul></p><p>of which the first is little use without the latter, but the latter is to a large extent confirmed by the former. A certain quality attaches to this personality of the leader - particularly in the case of the chief - who has affinities with Weber's \"charisma\".</p><p>In the Baluch Period (before 1928), where possible a chief operated from a fort in an agricultural centre, and generally either owed (informal) allegiances to a senior chief, or was owed allegiances by another chief or chiefs. He was traditionally entitled to a tithe on the produce of the land he controlled (apart from his major share of the produce from the land he owned), and service from the pastoralists. In addition to this in many cases he also collected a tax (in origin nourped from the Persian Government) from all sections of the population. Despite definite class distinctions, n some cases linked with differnces in occupation and conventional behaviour, there is little real differentiation in standard of living between the leader and the led, and no privacy for the chief.</p><p>6. The overwhelming majority of all Baluch are Sunni muslims of the Hanafi rite, and the words Islam and religion are synonyms in Baluchi. Although the chief provides the major force for social control in the society, Islamic law (interpreted by the maulawi) provides an alien standard and constitutes a court of appeal. In present circumstances, now that the chiefs in general no longer have physical force at their disposal, the religious role-statuses play a greater part in social control and leadership. The basis of the legitimacy of this \"formal religion\" is alien, inasmuch as its representatives have to study outside the Province. Given \"personality\" this legitimacy may be sufficient to allow the maulawi to rival a chief as a leader. But even so, and despite the charisma of Islam, without physical force he would not be able to impose settlements any more than a chief. The personal element is as much a part of religious as of secular leadership.</p><p>Not all the religious concepts and practices in the Provinces are accepted by the formal religions. We therefore use the term \"informal religion\" to cover unrationalised religious attitudes and practices which though they may not be denied by the formal religion do not form a conscious part of it, and we treat the role-status of darwish as the personification of the informal religion in the society. The position of the darwish may or may not be tribal, that of the maulawi is never tribal. The chief is often called on to fulfil many of the functions of the darwish.</p><p>7. In practice therefore in Baluch society now a leader may be either secular, formal religious, or informal religious, while the authority of his leadership is based on qualities of personality plus either birth, foreign religious learning, or esoteric religious knowledge respectively. Their power depends on these bases plus a combination of sociological factors such as kin, affinal and allegiance ties. Whatever the basis of the leader's legitimacy, or the scope of his power, the authority which he wields includes both temporal and spiritual aspects and these two aspects are not consciously differentiated. We can go no further in the analysis of leadership without analysing the \"personality\" of the leader.</p><p>8. In the context of this argument there is much similarity between the Persian Baluch and (among published ethnography) the southern Iraqi Kurds, the Swat Pathans, the Basseri in south Persia, the Marri Baluch in West Pakistan, the Somali, the Arab Bedouin, the Asande, and the feudal society of Medieval Europe, and comparative material from each of these societies is chosen to illustrate further various aspects of this type of leadership's situation, and show the general relevance and importance of the Baluch material.</p><p>9. A third party judges a chief by the quality and quantity of kamash who own allegiance to him. In Baluch thinking men do not create a chief by selecting him as their leader. This is not surprising, for they do not have a word for chief. The chiefs come from certain families (referred to by the family or tribal name in lieu of a general term) which enjoy a higher status than any of the rest of the community. However, none of the role-statuses are in Baluch thinking elective. Four major criteria may be distinguished on which the Baluch choose a particular chief as their leader. These are on two planes:</p><p><ul><li>a) <ul><li>i. ecological situation - in fact, his power,</li><li>ii. personality - the sum of his personal qualities,</li></ul></li><li>b)<ul><li>i. present - what the above factors amount to now, and</li><li>ii. past - what they amounted to in the past, e.g. in the case of his father, etc.</li></ul></li></ul></p><p>It is doubtful whether any one of these factors may be said to be generally more important than the others.</p><p>In general, individual social relationships are amazingly stable, - until they become political relationships, when they tend to be unstable. The Baluch have a certain degree of social, but no specifically political, institutionalisation. This situation leaves a wide field for values of personality, and personality may be regarded as the main factor in political \"legitimacy\", - though the Baluch themselves do not think in terms of political legitimacy or even of \"political stability\". Ideological divisions militate against large scale landownership as a stable basis for legitimacy, and together with the traditional isolation of the Province these divisions have meant that it has never been in the interests of the Baluch to have one paramount high-status leader for the purposes of treating with the Persian Administration or other foreign powers. However, the marriage and inheritance practices tend to define and preserve dynasties, even though genealogy as such is never a factor in establishing their legitimacy for the majority of their followers. Nevertheless, the chief always co-ordinates a number of sociological divisions among his followers - only he can have sufficient status and mobility to overcome all the sociological and ecological barriers to political unity.</p><p>10. Social differentiation between religious and secular in the society is forced by the acceptance of an alien formal religion. Decrease in the temporal power of the secular role-status of chief has been compensated by an increase in demand for the spiritual functions he can fulfil. Paramount temporal power generally has its spiritual associations at least, if only because it symbolises the unity of the society. In the Baluch case, lack of institutionalization and formality in the choice of leaders, together with the lack of conscious differentiation between spiritua and temporal, is linked with the political importance of values of personality in the society. Charisma is the \"spiritual\" aspect of these values.</p><p>The mode of choice defines the society's own conception of its leader, and therefore in this case it is the primary clue to an understanding of what we have felt constrained to call \"charisma\". \"Personality\" may be divided into:</p><ul><li>i) objective factors - which may be determined by analysing the total objective ecological relationship between the leader and his followers, and</li><li>ii) subjective factors - which are the values accorded by the followers to certain of the objective factors in the leader's personality.</li></ul></p><p>Charisma is the combination of the subjective factors. It is the \"otherness\" which the followers accord the leader subjectively.</p><p>Therefore, there is an inverse ratio between the degree of political institutionalisation and the importance of personality in leadership. And the need to lend a personality political legitimacy causes the follower to accord it a charismatic otherness subjectively, and this takes the leader's authority beyond the purely-temporal sphere.</p>" ],

  "texts" : [ "Reservation-based Network-on-Chip Timing Models for Large-scale Architectural Simulation", "Architectural simulation is an essential tool when it comes to evaluating the design of future many-core chips. However, reproducing all the components of such complex systems precisely would require unreasonable amounts of computing power. Hence, a trade off between accuracy and compute time is needed. For this reason most state-of-the-art tools do not have accurate models for the networks-on-chip, and rely on timing models that permit fast-simulation. Generally, these models are very simplistic and disregard contention for the use of network resources. As the number of nodes in the network-on-chip grows, fluctuations with contention and other parameters can considerably affect the accuracy of such models. In this paper we present and evaluate a collection of timing models based on a reservation scheme which consider the contention for the use of network resources. These models provide results quickly while being more accurate than simple no-contention approaches." ],

We examine themes from our interviews such as ‘dignity’, ‘normality’, ‘happiness’ and the ‘affordability’ and ‘ease’ of life in the UK (compared to Poland). We focus on the autobiographical or intra-personal discursive practices that define what Habib calls migrants' continuing relationship with their ‘homeland’. We draw on Emirbayer and Mische's analysis of the relationship between ‘agency’ and what they call ‘embedded temporalities’ to examine the interaction between our participants' recollections of life in Poland and their evaluation of their present lives in the UK in order to examine the impact of these on their future plans (to stay in the UK or return to Poland). We locate this analysis in what we call a transnational autobiographical field which is a modification of what Levitt and Glick Schiller call a transnational social field. Rather than examine, for example, how decisions to migrate, settle and re-migrate are embedded in inter or trans-personal social relations and networks, in this article we examine the self-dynamics associated with our participants' articulation of their intra-personal and autobiographical embedded temporalities. Our argument is that articulations of individuals' pasts, presents and anticipated futures are also significant factors shaping their migration, settlement, and re-migration decisions." ],

Using the Religious and Moral Pluralism (RAMP) survey from 10 European countries, four subtypes of “fuzzy fidelity” were identified through cluster analysis. These included both “believing without belonging” and “belonging without believing.” Detailed analysis of each type show great national differences in the ways that religion is practiced and understood. A sizable minority of the Dutch population can be classified as “Believing without belonging,” whereas Scandinavians are much more likely to belong without believing. The diversity of the religious landscape within fuzzy fidelity highlights the methodological issues involved in using single-scale measures for multidimensional phenomena." ],

Little is yet known regarding the co-stimulatory environment that favours the development of Foxp3(+) Treg-cell responses during helminth infections. As recent evidence implicates the co-stimulatory receptor ICOS in defining Foxp3(+) Treg-cell functions, we investigated the role of ICOS in helminth-induced Foxp3(+) Treg-cell responses. Infection of ICOS(-/-) mice with Heligmosomoides polygyrus or Schistosoma mansoni led to a reduced expansion and maintenance of Foxp3(+) Treg cells. Moreover, during H. polygyrus infection, ICOS deficiency resulted in increased Foxp3(+) Treg-cell apoptosis, a Foxp3(+) Treg-cell specific impairment in IL-10 production, and a failure to mount putatively adaptive Helios(-) Foxp3(+) Treg-cell responses within the intestinal lamina propria. Impaired lamina propria Foxp3(+) Treg-cell responses were associated with increased production of IL-4 and IL-13 by CD4(+) T cells, demonstrating that ICOS dominantly downregulates Type 2 responses at the infection site, sharply contrasting with its Type 2-promoting effects within lymphoid tissue. Thus, ICOS regulates Type 2 immunity in a tissue-specific manner, and plays a key role in driving Foxp3(+) Treg-cell expansion and function during helminth infections." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Forging sustainable peace in Mindanao : the role of civil society", "This study investigates the role of civil society in forging sustainable peace in Mindanao. It argues that civil society groups have the potential to make significant contributions to the management of the separatist conflict in the southern Philippines and in forging durable peace. Due to the inherent weakness of civil society groups, however, as well as other local and national conditions, their impact has been indirect, limited, and of little consequence to the macropolitical process. Nevertheless, the role of civil society in peacebuilding is important and should be developed. To this end, the study offers several recommendations to strengthen civil society, especially Muslim civil society, and deepen its interaction with the public at large (especially the Christian population) as well as local and national governments—all with a view to enhancing the key role that civil society groups can play in bringing about a lasting peace in Mindanao.\r\n\r\nThere is an active peace movement in Mindanao that reflects the general strength of civil society in the Philippines as a whole as well as special efforts made to manage Mindanao conflicts over the years. Beginning in the 1970s under the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos and continuing to the present day, both Christian and Muslim groups have attempted to build avenues to manage hostilities. This study construes “civil society” to include a wide range of organizations—from development NGOs to church-based groups and business associations. All of these organizational types are in one way or another involved in efforts to manage the conflict in the southern Philippines. They not only network in various ways among themselves and with organizations in the capital, Manila, but have international linkages. This study describes this welter of entities and relationships. It also points out that Muslim civil society is, for a number of reasons, less developed than its Christian counterpart, leading to some imbalance in peace efforts. Other characteristics of civil society include ideological divisions among the groups, the transitory nature of networks, and the fact that they are overwhelmingly intracommunal, i.e. based either exclusively among Christians or among Muslims. Further, Christian groups active in the peace movement are not representative of the citizenry at large, which supports aggressive moves to achieve “victory” over Muslim insurgents.\r\n\r\nIn this context, the study argues that civil society in Mindanao can contribute significantly in terms of managing the conflict and ultimately achieving lasting peace in Mindanao. A number of specific peace efforts are described here. Interreligious dialogue was started in the 1970s but accelerated in the 1990s. There is an asymmetry in the dialogue, however, given that Christianity is more organized than Islam and Christians have more distrust to overcome. Even more serious is the limited reach of such efforts at dialogue, even within the Catholic clergy. A second set of\r\npeace activities involves civil society helping local communities establish “spaces for peace” where combatants are requested to stay out of a particular locality. Known by several names, these local efforts are motivated by communities who wish to avoid the effects of further conflict. But spaces for peace are limited, too, inasmuch as various parties to conflict do not respect the provisions established by the communities. Finally, civil society has been involved directly in the peace process over the years. Civil society groups helped the new Arroyo government move toward peace in consultations leading up the August 2001 cessation of hostilities with the MILF, for instance. And they helped roll back the level of conflict by agitating for a restoration of the cease-fire in July 2003 after the Arroyo administration’s assault on the MILF’s Buliok complex. Civil society is officially represented on the Local Monitoring Teams established under the Cessation of Hostilities and also has its own parallel cease-fire monitoring process in Bantay Cease-fire (Cease-fire Watch). The latter has been praised by both government and the MILF for providing impartial public analysis of accusations of violations of the terms of the Cessation of Hostilities.\r\n\r\nStill, peace has not come to Mindanao and formal peace talks remain suspended. This is not surprising: civil society’s role is inevitably secondary to firm government and insurgent commitments to peace. In addition to specific weaknesses, the inherent difficulty of transcending specific interests to embrace a larger political agenda means that civil society’s impact on macropolitical processes is limited. Instead, civil society’s peace agitation tends to have indirect effects. Civil society can air discussion of the root causes of conflict; it can argue in the media and with policy elites against pursuing “victory” and in favor of developmental changes; and it can provide political space for government officials to maneuver toward a settlement. In short, the nature of civil society affects its impact on conflict management; the involvement of civil society can improve the chances for a lasting peace; but there are inherent limits to the impact that NGOs can have on peace—limitations that can only be overcome by state action.\r\n\r\nDespite these limitations and weaknesses, local and international civil society organizations can help bring about lasting peace in the region. To this end, the study makes several recommendations:\r\n\r\n\r\nMuslim civil society needs to be strengthened to rectify Muslim/Christian imbalances.\r\nCivil society networks involved in the peace movement should be strengthened to help transform them from shifting alliances into organizations capable of bringing Muslims and Christians together in a sustained fashion.\r\nEmpirical work on the impact of various approaches (interreligious dialogue, peace zones, effects on citizen attitudes) should be used to help guide conflict management efforts.\r\nConflict management must involve local governments—particularly given the decentralized nature of politics and administration in the Philippines.\r\nCivil society organizations must work with policy elites to reach the public at large, to expose citizens to issues involved in peace talks, and to win the hearts and minds of the Christian populace." ],

We discuss how we capture students‟ marks andcommon difficulties in a short period, so we can plan an example class addressing these.We explain why we have chosen a commercial e-assessment tool. We discuss the types ofassignments available, especially those which allow for algebraic answers, and show whichtypes of assessments were found most effective, and describe the underlying reasons. Wewill specifically discuss the steps that were needed to take to create a positive experiencefor the students—our initial experience was quite negative, and influenced the students'engagement.We discuss in detail the important lessons we have learned about the mechanisms of qualitycontrol that underlie the use of online mathematical assessments. The core step in ourmethod is to use student answers to test the quality of questions. The way of performingquality tests is highly non-trivial and time-consuming, but is crucially important. Finally, weshall discuss further developments that would make this type of rich assessment more usefulto the students." ],

Resistance to triazole azole antifungal drugs in Aspergillus fumigatus is now a major clinical problem in a number of European locations, in China, Canada and the USA with particularly high frequencies from the north-west of the UK, and The Netherlands. A number of centers are reporting the continuing increasing frequency and evolution of resistance mechanisms in A. fumigatus, in both azole-naïve and patients treated with azoles. The increasing rate of resistance is of concern. A number of resistance mechanisms have been found. The biofilm modality of Aspergillus growth may have a number of therapeutic implications for aspergillosis, including antifungal resistance. Microbiological diagnosis of aspergillosis is limited by poor culture yield, leading to uncertainty about the frequency of triazole resistance. Direct resistance testing in culture-negative clinical samples may add additional insights into the prevalence of azole resistance in A. fumigatus." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Explaining Financial Scandals: Corporate Governance, Structured Finance and the Enlightened Sovereign Control Paradigm", "Submitted by Vincenzo Bavoso for the degree of PhD entitled “Explaining financial scandals: corporate governance, structured finance and the enlightened sovereign control paradigm”, School of Law, Faculty of Humanities, The University of Manchester, 30/06/2012.The explosion of the global financial crisis in 2007-08 reignited the urgency to reflect on the origins and causes of financial collapses. As the above events kick-started an economic meltdown that is still ongoing, comparisons with the Great Crash of 1929 started to abound. In particular, the externalities that a broad spectrum of societal groups had to bear as a consequence of various banking failures highlighted the necessity of a more inclusive and balanced regulation of firms whose activities impact on a wide range of stakeholders.The thesis is centred on the proposal of a paradigm, the “enlightened sovereign control”, that provides a theoretical, institutional and substantive framework as a response to the legal issues analysed in the thesis. These stem primarily from the analysis of two sequences of events (the 2001-03 wave of “accounting frauds” and the 2007-08 global crisis) which represent the background upon which modern financial scandals are explained. This is done by highlighting a number of common denominators emerging from the case studies (Enron and Parmalat, Northern Rock and Lehman Brothers) which caused financial instability and scandals. The research is grounded on the initial recognition of theoretical themes in the field of corporate and financial law, which eventually link with the more practical events examined. This parallel enquiry leads to the investigation of two heavily interrelated spheres of law and finally highlights more practical legal issues that emerge from the analysis.Through this multifaceted approach, the thesis contends that the occurrence of financial crises during the last decade is essentially rooted in two main problems: a corporate governance one, represented by the lack of effective control systems within large public firms; and a corporate finance one identified with the excesses of financial innovation and related abuses of capital market finance. Research conducted in this thesis ultimately seeks to contribute to current debates in the areas of corporate and financial law, through the proposals of the “enlightened sovereign control” paradigm." ],

This study combined 1) quantitative comparisons of biology persisters and switchers via a questionnaire developed for the study and survival analysis of a larger population of biology freshmen with 2) qualitative comparison of biology switchers and persisters via semi-structured life story interviews and homogenous focus groups.  319 students (207 persisters and 112 switchers) participated in the questionnaire and 36 students (20 persisters and 16 switchers) participated in life story and focus group interviews.  All participants were undergraduates who entered The University of Texas at Austin as biology freshmen in the fall semesters of 2000 through 2004.  Findings of this study suggest:  1) Regardless of eventual major, biology students enter college with generally the same suite of experiences, sources of personal encouragement, and reasons for choosing the biology major; 2) Despite the fact that they have also had poor experiences in the major, biology persisters do not actively decide to stay in the biology major; they simply do not leave; 3) Based upon survival analysis, biology students  are most at-risk of leaving the biology major during the first two years of college and if they are African-American or Latino, women, or seeking a Bachelor  of Arts degree (rather than a Bachelor of Science); 4) Biology switchers do not leave biology due to preference for other disciplines; they leave due to difficulties or dissatisfaction with aspects of the biology major, including their courses, faculty, and peers; 5) Biology performance has a differential effect on persistence in the biology major, depending on how well students perform in comparison to other courses or other students." ],

Historically, in the UK this was the pattern for the traditional professions of law, accountancy, medicine and architecture. More recently in the UK, sandwich courses, predominantly a 'new' university contribution to higher education, have been developed to give students a balance between academic theory and practical professional experience.

The current study explored the relationship between depression and anxiety in Parkinson’s disease and frontal lobe cognitive impairment. Twenty community-based participants with PD were compared with 20 participants, over the age of 60 years, without a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease, matched for age, sex, educational level, and pre-morbid intelligence. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to measure mood, and the FAS Verbal Fluency test, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and a Stroop test were employed to measure frontal lobe cognitive functioning.  The group with Parkinson’s disease was characterised by greater anxiety and depression, in addition to impaired Verbal Fluency performance, compared with the group without the disorder. Participants with PD and major depression as defined by the HADS exhibited greater general cognitive impairment as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Younger participants and those in whom the disease had been diagnosed at a younger age were more likely to suffer from anxiety. A number of participants with Parkinson’s disease exhibited co-morbid anxiety and depression. In addition, four of the research sample with Parkinson’s disease scored below the cut-off point on the MMSE indicative of cognitive impairment sufficient to suggest dementia. Implications for those living with Parkinson’s disease plus recommendations for future research are discussed." ],

  "texts" : [ "Distributed Load Balancing in Many-To-One Wireless Sensor Networks", "A typical sensor network is conceived as being a very large collection of low-powered, homogeneous nodes that remain static post-deployment and forward sensed data to a single sink via multi-hop communication. For these types of networks there is an inherent funnelling effect whereby the nodes that can communicate directly with the sink must collectively forward the traffic of the entire network and therefore these nodes use more energy than the other nodes. This is known as the energy hole problem because after some time, these nodes deplete their batteries and leave an energy hole cutting the sink off from the network.In this thesis two new routing protocols are proposed that aim to maximise load balancing among these most critical nodes in order to maximise lifetime. They are the first fully distributed routing protocols that are designed to generate a load balanced routing tree to mitigate the energy hole problem. The results show that the better performing of the two is capable of creating a highly balanced tree at the cost of a small increase in latency.Although there have been other fully distributed protocols that aim at a similar form of load balancing, it is proven that the approach they take cannot guarantee perfect balance among the most critical nodes even in unrealistically generous scenarios. This suggests that they are not well suited to that task and the simulation results show that the novel protocols proposed in this thesis outperform the best of the alternatives.Before these protocols are proposed, the absolute reception-based blacklisting routing strategy is shown to be more energy efficient than previously thought and indeed more efficient than the strategy that has previously been considered optimal. This result is used to strongly justify the use of the unit disk graph model in simulations of sensor networks. Additionally, the relay hole problem in sensor networks is analysed for the first time." ],

  "texts" : [ "Duckworth, V., Ingle, S., and Lord, J. (2012).  Shifting sands and teacher education: preparing future lifelong learning teachers for their first years in professional teaching practice, or preparing them to keep their heads above water?", "This collaborative study explores the transitions of three former further education teachers, at different points in their academic careers, into Higher Education teaching.   We suggest that this transition inevitably brings a number of personal and professional challenges. With an increasing move towards performativity via target setting, results and accountability, a great deal of academics’ time and energy is governed by a managerial-driven system based on close scrutiny of paperwork, and increasing emotional labour (e.g. Bathmaker and Avis, 2006) in work environments where job security is unstable due to redundancies and restructuring. This often leaves academics fearful of their job security, exhausted and reluctant to challenge the hegemony based on quantifiable outcomes whereby notions of critical autonomy are side-lined for compliance. The data draws on life history methodology and narrative enquiry.   It explores our stories and the process of what Clough and Nutbrown (2002, p.81) describe as ‘focused conversations’. It moves from viewing society as a disembodied structure, and instead sets our narratives against the backdrop of cultural, historical and political landscape, providing a life history methodology that allows us to make sense of our transitions through our connections.  The intertwining of our narratives provides an insight into how university lecturers engage in shaping a professional identity, and leads us to suggest that communities of practice (Lave and Wenger, 1991, Wenger, 1998, Wenger et al., 2002) can support teachers’ critical autonomy in their early career." ],

As a complement to approaches to mathematically model capacity fade that require detailed understanding of each mechanism, capacity fade was accurately and efficiently predicted for future cycles using a discrete approach by extrapolating the change in effective transport and kinetic parameters with cycle number (N) for a battery tested under controlled experimental conditions. The effective parameters and their uncertainties are estimated using a mathematical reformulation of a porous electrode model, whose computational efficiency enables the integration of the proposed approach into an inexpensive microprocessor for estimating the remaining lifetime of a battery based on past charge-discharge curves. The approach may also provide some guidance for designers as to which battery components to focus on for redesign to reduce capacity fade." ],

  "texts" : [ "Connective action for regeneration: A comparative case study of social networks andcommunity infrastructure in New East Manchester", "This study explores the mechanisms underpinning policy efforts to build community indeprived urban neighbourhoods using a mixed-method comparative case study. Twoneighbourhoods within the New East Manchester (NEM) urban regeneration area areexamined, one of which hosted a New Deal for Communities (NDC) regenerationpartnership from 1999-2010. In 2009 the NDC successor body established a communityforum in each neighbourhood in an attempt to sustain and extend NDC’s participatorypractices. The study compares the community infrastructure embodied by the residents’groups eligible to participate in the forum in each neighbourhood. Social networks data,standard survey metrics and ethnographic material on 61 groups were collected. Theseelucidate the structure of groups’ relations, their collective action capacity and the extentto which NDC, and its successor, NEM, were implicated in the formation and developmentof these relations.NDC was the most prominent expression of the New Labour’s social capital-orientated“turn to community” (Duffy and Hutchinson, 1997). However, the final national evaluationof the scheme raised doubts about its impact, finding little effect on community relations atthe neighbourhood level (CLG, 2010c). This gap between policy ambition and outcome isprobed in this study using new tools and employing concepts from the social movements’literature, rather than the social capital framework underpinning most existing research onNDC. It focusses specifically social relations as a metric of community infrastructure, butresists the network analytic tendency to infer community from the mere presence ofrelations (Blokland, 2003). Instead it seeks evidence of the capacity for pairwise ties to betranslated into communal mobilization through the interplay of relational, cognitive andcontextual mechanisms, including specific facets of the political opportunity structures(POS) of NDC. The study contributes to debates on policy, theory and method relevant to:the practice of civic engagement and community development in regeneration; thesociology of community in deprived post-industrial neighbourhoods; and the measurementof community capacity and collective agency.Analysis of social networks considers three levels: the connection of individual residentsto each group; relations between groups within the neighbourhood; and relations betweengroups and local service-providers. Results show very similar levels of networkconnectivity in the two neighbourhoods, but greater evidence of the growth of sustainablegrassroots organising and leadership capacity in the non-NDC area. Quantitative andqualitative analysis of POS concludes that NDC was instrumental in generating aconstrained, controllable form of community engagement to meet the deliveryrequirements of the scheme. This process stifled the development of a wider, independentself-organising capacity on the ground, sustainable beyond the life of NDC." ],

  "texts" : [ "WIRELESS RAY TRACING EDUCATIONAL LAND", "Technology has a great impact and influence on the educational process in classroom environments. Students can use the advanced computing and telecommunication technologies, to access different types of information and to communicate with their teachers and colleagues using several types of media. Among the new emerging technologies are online three dimensional virtual worlds (3D VWs). This technology can aid students in understanding and predicting physical behaviour, which would otherwise require interactive simulations and laboratories that may be expensive, time consuming and dangerous. Traditional simulations can help carry out virtual experiments but they are often not very interactive, and are frequently complex and slow. 3D VWs provide a natural interactive exploration environment, where individuals and groups can interact and learn. The prototype Wireless Ray-Tracing Educational Land (WRTEL) was built using the OpenSimulator VWs technology, to improve the learning experience for electrical engineering and physics students studying electromagnetic wireless systems. Instead of using textbooks, pictures, equations and paper examples to understand how wireless signals propagate, signals are visualized in an interactive 3D virtual environment. This paper presents the prototype WRTEL, where invisible wireless signal propagation is made visible using the VW technology. Students are able to visualize signal behaviour (reflection, refraction, diffraction and scattering) in either two dimensions (2D) or three dimensions (3D), and information about each interaction between signals and the surrounding environment can be displayed. The WRTEL consists of three main regions. In the first region, three educational tools have been implemented to explore the relationship between wavelength and frequency, the electromagnetic spectrum and antennas. In the second region, a free space laboratory had been designed in simulated outer space to allow students to visualize line of sight signal propagation between the transmitter and the receiver antennas. In the third region, students are provided with a selectable two or three dimensional ray-tracing laboratory, to create environments using obstacles made from different materials. Students will be able to visualize how signal behaviour (reflection, refraction, diffraction and scattering) is affected by the surrounding environment. Path loss calculations, received power, angle of incidence and many other values will be provided at any point in space until the signal is received by the receiver antenna. The transmitted wireless signals will be visualized by mapping them into the visual spectrum for display; this makes the invisible rays visible. A brief technical and educational evaluation indicated that the prototype educational land was both usable and would support student learning activities in laboratories." ],

In Arabidopsis thaliana, shortage of potassium (K) induces a number of genes related to the phytohormone jasmonic acid (JA). Using comparative microarray analysis of wild-type and coi1-16 mutant plants, we classified transcriptional responses to K with respect to their dependence on COI1, a central component of oxylipin signaling. Expression profiles obtained in a short-term experiment clearly distinguished between COI1-dependent and COI1-independent K-responsive genes, and identified both known and novel targets of JA-COI1-signaling. During long-term K-deficiency, coi-16 mutants displayed de novo responses covering similar functions as COI1-targets except for defense. A putative role of JA for enhancing the defense potential of K-deficient plants was further supported by the observation that plants grown on low K were less damaged by thrips than plants grown with sufficient K." ],

  "texts" : [ "Caveolin-1 (P132L), a common breast cancer mutation, confers mammary cell invasiveness and defines a novel stem cell/metastasis-associated gene signature.", "Here we used the Met-1 cell line in an orthotopic transplantation model in FVB/N mice to dissect the role of the Cav-1(P132L) mutation in human breast cancer. Identical experiments were performed in parallel with wild-type Cav-1. Cav-1(P132L) up-regulated the expression of estrogen receptor-alpha as predicted, because only estrogen receptor-alpha-positive patients have been shown to harbor Cav-1(P132L) mutations. In the context of primary tumor formation, Cav-1(P132L) behaved as a loss-of-function mutation, lacking any tumor suppressor activity. In contrast, Cav-1(P132L) caused significant increases in cell migration, invasion, and experimental metastasis, consistent with a gain-of-function mutation. To identify possible molecular mechanism(s) underlying this invasive gain-of-function activity, we performed unbiased gene expression profiling. From this analysis, we show that the Cav-1(P132L) expression signature contains numerous genes that have been previously associated with cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. These include i) secreted growth factors and extracellular matrix proteins (Cyr61, Plf, Pthlh, Serpinb5, Tnc, and Wnt10a), ii) proteases that generate EGF and HGF (Adamts1 and St14), and iii) tyrosine kinase substrates and integrin signaling/adapter proteins (Akap13, Cdcp1, Ddef1, Eps15, Foxf1a, Gab2, Hs2st1, and Itgb4). Several of the P132L-specific genes are also highly expressed in stem/progenitor cells or are associated with myoepithelial cells, suggestive of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These results directly support clinical data showing that patients harboring Cav-1 mutations are more likely to undergo recurrence and metastasis." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Control and path prediction of an Automate Guided Vehicle", "Purpose: In this paper a new architecture and control strategy of an AGV is proposed. It is organized as follows.The system architecture is explained in section 2. Section 3 deals with the kinematics model of the AGV path,prediction and control. Section 4 describes the experiments. The conclusion and recommendation are given insection 5.Design/methodology/approach: It is a three wheels vehicle. The front wheel is used for driving and steering theAGV and the two rear wheels are free. The steering and driving are DC motor. Two encoders are individuallyattached on the two rear wheels in order to measure the vehicle displacement and then calculate its real timeposition and orientation. The choice of positioning the encoders on the free wheels provides to the vehicle anaccurate measurement of its progression. A programmable logic control (PLC) is used for motion control.Findings: In this paper, An Automate Guided Vehicle (AGV) is presented. The developed algorithm is basedon memorised path and kinematics determination of the movement. The vehicle position and deviation arecalculated from rear wheels rotation measurement. The steering and driving command are determined fromthis deviation. Localization of AGV by Kaman filtering algorithm is presented. Control of AGV motion isimplemented by using PID control scheme. Displacement axis and steering axis are separated to implementthe motion control. We proposed the localization system for estimation of AGV. Position and orientation areestimated by Kalman filtering in state-space model. Position and orientation of AGV are measured and used forsimulation for localization system. We conclude that the vehicle can reach from the initial position moved alongwith generated path with accurate location. A Schneider PLC is used to implement this control. The tests reveala smooth movement and convenient deviation.Practical implications: The first prototype working, the next research steps will be development of a correctionsystem to correct none detected errors. It will also be necessary to develop the fleet management strategy andsoftware.Originality/value: Future work is planed to increase the accuracy of the system by equip more sensors forobservation technique. Treatment of dynamic model and machine vision application of automated vehicle arealso planed to the next step" ],

  "texts" : [ "Mechanistic reappraisal of early stage photochemistry in the light-driven enzyme protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase.", "The light-driven enzyme protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR) catalyzes the reduction of protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) to chlorophyllide (Chlide). This reaction is a key step in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll. Ultrafast photochemical processes within the Pchlide molecule are required for catalysis and previous studies have suggested that a short-lived excited-state species, known as I675*, is the first catalytic intermediate in the reaction and is essential for capturing excitation energy to drive subsequent hydride and proton transfers. The chemical nature of the I675* excited state species and its role in catalysis are not known. Here, we report time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy measurements to study the involvement of the I675* intermediate in POR photochemistry. We show that I675* is not unique to the POR-catalyzed photoreduction of Pchlide as it is also formed in the absence of the POR enzyme. The I675* species is only produced in samples that contain both Pchlide substrate and Chlide product and its formation is dependent on the pump excitation wavelength. The rate of formation and the quantum yield is maximized in 50∶50 mixtures of the two pigments (Pchlide and Chlide) and is caused by direct energy transfer between Pchlide and neighboring Chlide molecules, which is inhibited in the polar solvent methanol. Consequently, we have re-evaluated the mechanism for early stage photochemistry in the light-driven reduction of Pchlide and propose that I675* represents an excited state species formed in Pchlide-Chlide dimers, possibly an excimer. Contrary to previous reports, we conclude that this excited state species has no direct mechanistic relevance to the POR-catalyzed reduction of Pchlide." ],

These normal intracellular and abnormal extracellular roles can be attributed to the multidomain structure of AGR2. The NMR structure shows that AGR2 consists of an unstructured N-terminal region followed by a thioredoxin fold. The protein exists in monomer-dimer equilibrium with a K(d) of 8.83μM, and intermolecular salt bridges involving E60 and K64 within the folded domain serve to stabilize the dimer. The unstructured region is primarily responsible for the ability of AGR2 to promote cell adhesion, while dimerization is less important for this activity. The structural data of AGR2 show a separation between potential catalytic redox activity and adhesion function within the context of metastasis and development." ],

However, studies assessing pre-travel health-seeking practices from a variety of medical and non-medical sources and vaccine uptake prior to travel to both developing and developed countries within the Asia-Pacific region are scarce.</p> <p><b>Methods</b></p> <p>Cross-sectional surveys were conducted between July and December 2007 to assess pre-travel health seeking practices, including advice from health professionals, health information from other sources and vaccine uptake, in a sample of travelers departing Sydney and Bangkok airports. A two-stage cluster sampling technique was used to ensure representativeness of travelers and travel destinations. Pre-travel health seeking practices were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire distributed at the check-in queues of departing flights. Logistic regression models were used to identify significant factors associated with seeking pre-travel health advice from a health professional, reported separately for Australian residents, residents of other Western countries and residents of countries in Asia.</p> <p><b>Results</b></p> <p>A total of 843 surveys were included in the final sample (Sydney 729, response rate 56%; Bangkok 114, response rate 60%). Overall, pre-travel health information from any source was sought by 415 (49%) respondents with 298 (35%) seeking pre-travel advice from a health professional, the majority through general practice. Receipt of a pre-travel vaccine was reported by 100 (12%) respondents. Significant factors associated with seeking pre-travel health advice from a health professional differed by region of residence. Asian travelers were less likely to report seeking pre-travel health advice and uptake of pre-travel vaccines than Australian or other Western travelers. Migrant Australians were less likely to report seeking pre-travel health advice than Australian-born travelers.</p> <p><b>Conclusions</b></p> <p>This study highlights differences in health-seeking practices including the uptake of pre-travel health advice by region of residence and country of birth. There is a public health need to identify strategies targeting these travel groups. This includes the promotion of affordable and accessible travel clinics in low resource countries as traveler numbers increase and travel health promotion targeting migrant groups in high resource countries. General practitioners should play a central role. Determining the most appropriate strategies for increasing pre-travel health preparation, particularly for vaccine preventable diseases in travelers is the next stage in advancing travel medicine research.</p" ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "School staff perceptions of well-being and experience of an intervention to promote mental well-being", "AbstractEducational Psychologists (EPs) spend much of their time working with school staff to solve problems. Staff often report perceptions of high levels of stress, overwork and lack of time to plan and implement changes indicating frequent experience of poor mental well-being. There has been a recent increase in awareness of promoting the well-being of children and young people, however, little attention appears to have been focused as yet upon the school staff who will promote and support this agenda.Research in schools has tended to focus on teachers rather than including all staff. There is a preponderance of research clarifying contributors to teachers’ stress and, to a lesser extent describing interventions in schools. However, little research has focused on school staff understanding and value of well-being and about perceptions of interventions carried out in schools. This study aimed to obtain a greater understanding of the perceptions of school staff about well-being, the value they placed upon it and the experience and perceived impact of taking part in a study aiming to promote staff well-being. An 8 week intervention was carried out in a primary school with weekly sessions of a project which was known as ‘Chill and Chat’. Data was gathered via questionnaires completed before and after the project and 3 focus groups held before, during and after the project. Data was analysed using thematic analysis.It was found that well-being was seen as important, however, colleagues with poor mental well-being were ‘pathologised’. ‘Learning’ to cope and maintain positive well-being was perceived as a responsibility of the staff member. Staff perceived the informality of provision to support their well-being as important and valued the time to develop better relationships with colleagues rather than ‘working relationships’ and also feeling valued and cared for. Staff reported perceptions of greater efficacy in the classroom, increased job satisfaction and feeling calmer in the classroom. The most significant limitation of the study was the continuation of provision to support staff mental well-being which requires commitment and understanding from school senior management teams and local authority members regarding the impact that increased well being can have on teaching and learning and a shift of thought towards focusing on positive well-being promotion rather than managing poor well-being.There are implications for EP practice and research in helping school staff reflect on their well-being and actions that they can take as a team to promote well-being in school. EPs can also be instrumental in disseminating research findings highlighting the impact of staff mental well being on teaching and learning." ],

This paper examines the interaction between a lean supply chain strategy and supplier integration and explores the relationship between supplier integration and competitive capabilities. An empirical study was carried out using a sample drawn from the automotive industry in Thailand and structural equation modeling was employed to analyze the theoretical model. The findings indicated that a lean supply chain strategy has a positive relationship with supplier integration and that supplier integration can improve the firm’s competitive capabilities. In particular, supplier integration was observed to have the most impact on the competitive capability of process flexibility and, overall, the improvement of competitive capabilities appeared to vary according to the degree of supplier integration present in the relationship." ],

The paper details how the complex professional relationship of educational practitioner research, and the associated ethical issues, together with the variety of data analysed influenced the approach taken. The paper explores how the adaptations to constructed grounded theory process were applied and how this approach can be construed as grounded in grounded theory. <p></p> \r\n\r\nThe paper is explicit about the application and adaptation of grounded theory to meet the needs of the research and the epistemology of the researcher.  Many studies purporting to use grounded theory are less explicit, this paper is intended to contribute to the discussion and development of a flexible approach to grounded theory, fit for purpose within the restraints of a practitioner based virtual educational ethnographic study.<p></p>  \r\n\r\nThe relationship of the practitioner researcher (an Associate Lecturer) and the participants (the students) created a dichotomy between the neutrality and social distance of the researcher and the ethical implications for the Associate Lecturer.  Whilst the participants were not vulnerable adults, many of the participants were novice learners returning to study and therefore a duty of care was required. The paper explains how the adaptation of constructed grounded theory enhanced the analysis and provided richer data than ethnographic observation alone.<p></p>\r\n\r\nDespite the divergence from constructed grounded theory methods, rigor was achieved through the comparison of the coding produced throughout the analysis of the data.  This level of rigor led to the emergence of unanticipated themes which influenced the group work processes.  It is my belief that these would not have appeared through generic inductive approaches as they would have been overlooked and ignored without the line by line analysis.  The modification of the grounded theory process retained the influence of constructed grounded theory rather than claiming to be rooted in constructed grounded theory. But the techniques applied are not beyond comparison with grounded theory.  The research into virtual group work is timely in light of recent UK Government reports and relevant as interest in network delivered learning continues to grow." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "The performance of hybrid GPS and GLONASS", "In recent years, the market served by satellite positioning systems has expanded exponentially. It is stimulated by the needs of an ever increasing number and variety of scientific, business and leisure applications. The dominant system is the USA's GPS, or Global Positioning System. However, GPS is not a panacea for all positioning tasks, in any environmental situation. For example, two of the fastest growing applications, vehicle tracking and personal location, operate in an often harsh signal reception environment. This can be so severe that even with the current 29 working satellites, GPS may struggle to perform. In exceptional circumstances it can fail to provide a positioning service at all.\r\n\r\nThe simplest way to improve the situation when signal reception is poor, is to add similar signals from alternative satellite systems. This has already been achieved by combining GPS with the Russian satellite positioning system, Global'naya Navigatsionnaya Sputnikova Sistema, abbreviated to GLONASS. The combination of GPS with GLONASS is referred to here as Hybrid.\r\n\r\nBut how good is Hybrid relative to GPS, and how can performance be evaluated objectively? The research project presented here set out to answer this question, and to understand the situations in which Hybrid failed, and ask what solutions were then available to fulfil a positioning task. The problems associated with integrating one satellite positioning system with another, their potential inconsistencies and their impact on positioning errors were also examined. This field of research is relevant to Hybrid as defined here, and also to other mixed systems, for example GPS with EGNOS, a European geostationary satellite system, and GPS with Galileo, a proposed global system controlled by the Europeans.\r\n\r\nThe issues were addressed from the viewpoint of practical usage of the positioning systems. Hence the many and varied experiments to quantify positioning performance using both static receivers, and a variety of platforms with wide ranging levels of vehicle dynamics. The capability of satellite positioning systems to work in the harshest environments, was tested in the proposed Olympic sport of bob skeleton. This involved the development of the acquisition system, and a number of programs. The latter were equally applicable to the ensuing work with road vehicles, and the quantitative assessment of positioning performance relative to a truth.\r\n\r\nThe processes established to manipulate, import, and merge satellite based vehicle tracking data with Ordnance Survey digital mapping products, have already been used in four other projects within the School of Civil Engineering. The software to regularise positioning interval, smoothing processes, and to compare tracking data with a truth, have been similarly provided. Without major funding the outlook for GLONASS and hence Hybrid looks bleak, and it is predicted that without replenishment the constellation may fall to six satellites by the end of 2001. However as mentioned above, the issues identified, and ideas and software developed in this research, will be directly applicable to any future hybridisation of GPS with Galileo." ],

  "texts" : [ "Understanding the Warburg effect and the prognostic value of stromal caveolin-1 as a marker of a lethal tumor microenvironment.", "Cancer cells show a broad spectrum of bioenergetic states, with some cells using aerobic glycolysis while others rely on oxidative phosphorylation as their main source of energy. In addition, there is mounting evidence that metabolic coupling occurs in aggressive tumors, between epithelial cancer cells and the stromal compartment, and between well-oxygenated and hypoxic compartments. We recently showed that oxidative stress in the tumor stroma, due to aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction, is important for cancer cell mutagenesis and tumor progression. More specifically , increased autophagy/mitophagy in the tumor stroma drives a form of parasitic epithelial-stromal metabolic coupling. These findings explain why it is effective to treat tumors with either inducers or inhibitors of autophagy, as both would disrupt this energetic coupling. We also discuss evidence that glutamine addiction in cancer cells produces ammonia via oxidative mitochondrial metabolism. Ammonia production in cancer cells, in turn, could then help maintain autophagy in the tumor stromal compartment. In this vicious cycle, the initial glutamine provided to cancer cells would be produced by autophagy in the tumor stroma. Thus, we believe that parasitic epithelial-stromal metabolic coupling has important implications for cancer diagnosis and therapy, for example, in designing novel metabolic imaging techniques and establishing new targeted therapies. In direct support of this notion, we identified a loss of stromal caveolin-1 as a marker of oxidative stress, hypoxia, and autophagy in the tumor microenvironment, explaining its powerful predictive value. Loss of stromal caveolin-1 in breast cancers is associated with early tumor recurrence, metastasis, and drug resistance, leading to poor clinical outcome." ],

Here, we present computational classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the behavior of U(VI) in contact with different calcite surfaces. The calcium-uranyl-carbonate [Ca2UO2(CO3)(3)] species is shown to display both inner and outer-sphere adsorption to the flat {10 (1) over bar4} and the stepped {31 (4) over bar8} and {3 (12) over bar 16} planes of calcite. Free energy calculations, using the umbrella sampling method, are employed to simulate adsorption paths of the same uranyl species on the different calcite surfaces under aqueous condition. Outer-sphere adsorption is found to dominate over inner-sphere adsorption because of the high free energy barrier of removing a uranyl-carbonate interaction and replacing it with a new uranyl-surface interaction. An important bin monolayer between the surface and the sorbed complex. From the free complex was also found to adsorb preferentially on the acute-stepped ding mode is proposed involving a single vicinal water energy profiles of the different Calcite surfaces, the uranyl {31 (4) over bar8} face of calcite, in agreement with experiment." ],

The theoretical models were then modified to include impurity atoms. Both oxygen and carbon impurities were considered, as well as different structures, including singular oxygen atoms and oxygen next to carbon atoms.

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Venture capital returns, new firms and social networks", "These chapters study the return of venture capital investments with a focus on outliers and examine the formation of new firms that invest in entrepreneurial companies. First, I formulate a model and estimator of venture capital (VC) returns motivated by the entrepreneurial firm life-cycle and the extreme return outcomes of typical venture capital investments. The model incorporates tail events and the estimator corrects for sample selection bias and endogenous investment holding periods. I find that an asymmetric three-state mixture distribution is a better characterization of returns than the standard single-state model. Mixture states mimic typical VC outcomes : \"winners\", \"break-even\" and \"failures.\" Imposing normality on venture capital investment returns understates downside risk and kurtosis. In contrast to earlier studies, the mixture model reveals a leptokurtic, negatively-skewed returns distribution. Next, I investigate the consequences of venture capital employee spinoffs for parent firms and the characteristics of their founders. As predicted by the spinoff formation model of Cabral and Wang (2009), high type partners and low type partners at failing parent firms are the most likely to leave and start a new venture capital firm. After accounting for the endogeneity of the timing of spinoff formation, estimates reveal a large, negative impact of spinoffs on parent firm performance. The results indicate that a renewed focus on the venture capital partner, rather than the whole firm, could reveal new features of venture capital performance. Finally, the source of the competitive advantage of employee spinoff firms and their formation's negative impact on parent firms is often attributed to a transfer of knowledge from parent firm to spinoff. The third chapter studies one potential asset transfer in the venture capital industry that can explain both patterns : social networks. Results comparing the social network evolution of venture capital spinoffs and other new firms show that the former have more central network positions and gain those positions more quickly. Non-spinoffs are more likely to join smaller, more isolated cliques in the network. Spinoffs also have higher survival rates, co-invest with more experienced investors and produce more positive exit outcomes for their investments" ],

  "texts" : [ "The innate immune rheostat: influence on lung inflammatory disease and secondary bacterial pneumonia.", "The activity of innate immunity is not simply dictated by the presence of an antigen but also by the balance between negative regulatory and immune potentiator pathways. Even in the absence of antigen, innate immunity can 'inflame' if negative regulators are absent. This resting state is adaptable and dictated by environmental influences, host genetics and past infection history. A return to homoeostasis post inflammation may therefore not leave the tissue in an identical state to that prior to the inflammatory event. This adaptability makes us all unique and also explains the variable outcome experienced by a diverse population to the same inflammatory stimulus. Using murine models we have identified that influenza virus causes a long-term modification of the lung microenvironment by a de-sensitization to bacterial products and an increase in the myeloid negative regulator CD200R (CD200 receptor). These two events prevent subsequent inflammatory damage while the lung is healing, but also they may predispose to bacterial colonization of the lower respiratory tract should regulatory mechanisms overshoot. In the extreme, this leads to bacterial pneumonia, sepsis and death. A deeper understanding of the consequences arising from innate immune cell alteration during influenza infection and the subsequent development of bacterial complications has important implications for future drug development." ],

It is, therefore, of interest to identify and understand the genetic determinants of methylation and epigenomic variation. We investigated the extent to which genetic variation in cis-DNA sequence explains variation in CpG dinucleotide methylation in publicly available data for four brain regions from unrelated individuals, finding that 3–4% of CpG loci assayed were heritable, with a mean estimated narrow-sense heritability of 30% over the heritable loci. Over all loci, the mean estimated heritability was 3%, as compared with a recent twin-based study reporting 18%. Heritable loci were enriched for open chromatin regions and binding sites of CTCF, an influential regulator of transcription and chromatin architecture. Additionally, heritable loci were proximal to genes enriched in several known pathways, suggesting a possible functional role for these loci. Our estimates of heritability are conservative, and we suspect that the number of identified heritable loci will increase as the methylome is assayed across a broader range of cell types and the density of the tested loci is increased. Finally, we show that the number of heritable loci depends on the window size parameter commonly used to identify candidate cis-acting single-nucleotide polymorphism variants." ],

They involve making accurate measurements to test a predefined hypothesis in order to compare experimental data with predictions generated by theoretical models, an approach that has benefited physicists for decades. Building quantitative models in experimental biology not only has led to discoveries of counterintuitive phenomena but has also opened up novel research directions. To make the biological sciences more quantitative, we believe a two-pronged approach needs to be taken. First, graduate training needs to be revamped to ensure biology students are adequately trained in physical and mathematical sciences and vice versa. Second, students of both the biological and the physical sciences need to be provided adequate opportunities for hands-on engagement with the methods and approaches necessary to be able to work at the intersection of the biological and physical sciences. We present the annual Physiology Course organized at the Marine Biological Laboratory (Woods Hole, MA) as a case study for a hands-on training program that gives young scientists the opportunity not only to acquire the tools of quantitative biology but also to develop the necessary thought processes that will enable them to bridge the gap between these disciplines" ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Record of seamount production and off-axis evolution in the western North Atlantic Ocean, 25°25′–27°10′N", "Using multibeam bathymetry, we identified 86 axial and 1290 off-axis seamounts (near-circular volcanoes with heights ≥70 m) in an area of 75,000 km2 on the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR), 25°25′N to 27°10′N, extending ∼400 km from the inner rift valley floor to ∼29 Ma crust. Our study shows that seamounts are a common morphological feature of the North Atlantic seafloor. Seamount-producing volcanism occurs primarily on the inner rift valley floor, and few, if any, seamounts are formed on the rift valley walls or the ridge flank. The high abundance of off-axis seamounts is consistent with 1–3 km wide sections of oceanic crust being transferred intact from the axial valley to the ridge flank on crust >4 Ma. Significant changes in seamount abundances, sizes, and shapes are attributed to the effects of faulting between ∼0.6 and 2 m.y. off axis in the lower rift valley walls. Few seamounts are completely destroyed by (inward facing) faults, and population abundances are similar to those on axis. However, faulting reduces the characteristic height of the seamount population significantly. In the upper portions of the rift valley, on 2–4 Ma crust, crustal aging processes (sedimentation and mass wasting), together with additional outward facing faults, destroy and degrade a significant number of seamounts. Beyond the crest of the rift mountains (>4 Ma crust) faulting is no longer active, and changes in the off-axis seamount population reflect crustal aging processes as well as temporal changes in seamount production that occurred at the ridge axis. Estimates of population density for off-axis seamounts show a positive correlation to crustal thickness inferred from analysis of gravity data, suggesting that increased seamount production accompanies increased magma input at the ridge axis. We find no systematic variations in seamount population density along isochron within individual ridge segments. Possible explanations are that along-axis production of seamounts is uniform or that seamount production is enhanced in some regions (e.g., segment centers), but many seamounts do not meet our counting criteria because they are masked by younger volcanic eruptions and low-relief flows.Author Posting. © American Geophysical Union, 2000.

  "title" : "Friction Joining of Aluminium-to-Magnesium for Lightweight Automotive Applications",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Friction Joining of Aluminium-to-Magnesium for Lightweight Automotive Applications", "Friction joining techniques, such as Friction Stir Spot Welding (FSSW) and high power Ultrasonic Welding (USW), could offer a solution for joining dissimilar materials combinations, such as aluminium (Al) to magnesium (Mg), where high intermetallic reaction rates make the use of conventional joining techniques problematic. Ultrasonic welds have been produced between 1 mm gauge Al 6111-T4 and Mg AZ31-H24 sheets, and the interfacial reaction has been studied as a function of welding time. For this welding system, the mechanical properties of the joints were optimised when a double reed welding system was employed to join materials that had been prepared using 800 grit SiC paper under a clamping force of 1.9 kN, and when the materials were oriented with the rolling direction parallel to the vibration direction. Welds produced between Al and Mg achieved similar peak lap shear strengths to those produced between Mg and Mg at welding times of 0.4 s, but the failure energy of the Al-Mg welds was less than half that of the parent material. In addition, the Al-Mg welds always failed at the interface between the sheets, rather than the desirable, and more energy intensive, pullout mechanism. The inferior mechanical properties were attributed to the rapid formation of a brittle intermetallic layer that initially formed as islands of the γ-Al12Mg17 phase. These islands rapidly spread and became continuous within 0.3 s of welding time, at which point a second sublayer of the β-Al3Mg2 phase began to form on the Al side of the intermetallic reaction layer. The combined layers reached a total thickness of 20 µm within 0.9 s of welding time, with the β-Al3Mg2 sublayer becoming the thicker of the two by this point. At longer welding times, interface liquation was observed at temperatures below the recognised lowest temperature eutectic reaction in the Al-Mg binary phase diagram. This was the result of the alloying elements present in the system and there was no depression in the melting point as a result of the high strain rate associated with this process, as has been proposed elsewhere. The rate of growth of the intermetallic layer during welding was higher than in static heat treatments, which was most likely due to the deformation causing microcracking in the brittle intermetallic layer, allowing short circuit diffusion to occur, and enhancing the growth rate by a factor of approximately 2. Finally, attempts were made to limit the rate of intermetallic compound (IMC) formation by applying coatings to the Mg sheet. The effect of the coatings was to reduce the overall IMC layer thickness by 50 %." ],

  "texts" : [ "A Phase Ib, Dose-Finding Study of Erlotinib in Combination With a Fixed Dose of Pertuzumab in Patients With Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.", "BACKGROUND: Pertuzumab, a dimerization inhibitor of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), has demonstrated pharmacodynamic activity, with stable disease in non-small-cell lung cancer. Combining erlotinib and pertuzumab may enhance antitumor activity. This study aimed to establish the recommended dosing of the erlotinib and pertuzumab combination; assess safety, preliminary efficacy, and pharmacokinetics; and analyze biomarkers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with stage IIIb/IV non-small-cell lung cancer who failed chemotherapy were recruited. The patients received erlotinib (days -8 to -1), then combination therapy (21-day cycles for 6 cycles). Pertuzumab was given intravenous at 840 mg, then 420 mg once every three weeks, with erlotinib given daily (100 or 150 mg). RESULTS: No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Adverse events were generally grade 1/2 and manageable. The objective response rate was 20% (3/15 patients; 2 responders had mutant HER1, 1 responder had wild-type HER1), median overall progression-free survival was 9.3 weeks. High HER1, HER2, and HER3 messenger RNA expression correlated with increased progression-free survival. Combination therapy did not affect erlotinib's pharmacokinetics; however, pertuzumab mean exposures (maximum concentration, 231 mg/L; area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 21 days, 1780 mg*d/L) were slightly higher than in previous studies. CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy was well tolerated in patients with good performance status, with encouraging efficacy. A loading dose of pertuzumab 840 mg followed by 420 mg once every three weeks plus daily erlotinib 150 mg appears to be the most appropriate regimen for this combination." ],

In this paper, the core assumptions of communitarian philosophy and values are outlined, together with the way writers imagine these might be enacted in a social enterprise context. These assumptions are then explored using two case studies. <p></p>\r\nDesign/Methodology: The study was conducted using participatory action research which involves parties examining current actions together and seeking to improve on them. The value of this approach is based on the plausible, authentic and critical insights it generates into management practice.<p></p>\r\nFindings: Case evidence suggests that companies are able to adopt and operate effectively while deploying communitarian values, and that these values lead to alternative business objectives expressed through new forms of corporate governance. Nevertheless, the adopting of common language does not necessarily mean that social enterprises share a common philosophy.<p></p>\r\nOriginality/Value: The key contribution of this paper is to evaluate the institutionalisation of governance and consider the relationship between the form and substance of practice. By considering the link between words and actions, the study concludes that the adoption of a governance framework, or particular language, matters less than the capacity of company members to participate in the development of governance norms that enable them to act congruently with their own beliefs and values." ],

  "texts" : [ "Averaging of fish target strength functions", "A general model for averaging the acoustic target strength functions of fish is stated in calculable form. It accounts for the influences of the distribution of generally coupled spatial and orientation states of fish, geometric perspective, and beam patterns on observations of target strength. The model is developed and applied to observation of fish by directional, downward‐looking sonars. A particular example is considered in which the sonar is represented by an ideal circular piston, the spatial distribution of fish is homogeneous, and the orientation distribution is spatially homogeneous and characterized by a uniformily distributed azimuthal variable and an independent, essentially normally distributed tilt angle variable. Averaged and averaged‐squared backscattering cross sections are computed from high quality gadoid target strength functions measured at two ultrasonic frequencies. Results for a sonar half‐beamwidth of 2.5 deg for three different realizations of the tilt angle distribution are expressed in the logarithmic domain and regressed linearly on fish length. The significance of species, frequency, and orientation distribution differences among the regressions is noted. Estimates of the mean ratio of averaged‐squared backscattering cross section and squared‐averaged backscattering cross section are presented.Author Posting. © Acoustical Society of America, 1980.

As a result, parents tend to believe that nature hardly exists in their \r\nneighborhoods. The pervasiveness of this view has led to the strong influence of parents’ sense of \r\nvalues and families’ socioeconomic status on how their children experience nature. \r\nSecond, I describe what kind of environmental education has actually been implemented at a \r\npublic elementary school. Children are constructing their perspective of the natural environment \r\nnot only in the classes officially regarded as environmental education, but also in other aspects of \r\ntheir everyday school lives. Even when teachers do not think that they are teaching about the \r\nenvironment, their words and behavior convey culturally accepted ways to think, act and speak, \r\nand make decisions; this in turn influences the way students deal with nature. Thus, teachers are \r\nofficially and unofficially, consciously and unconsciously, implementing environmental \r\neducation. Nonetheless, today’s teachers believe that they conduct environmental education only \r\nin a weekly “Period of Integrated Learning.” While their preparation time for environmental \r\neducation is limited, they realize the existence of various obstacles for the implementation of \r\nenvironmental education, such as lack of time and resources and the fact that children do not have \r\nenough knowledge and experiences to understand environmental problems. They eventually \r\ncome to conduct environmental education through the lens of their own values. Yet, because of \r\nthe lack of efficient criteria to judge whether the activities have a positive influence on the \r\nchildren, teachers do not seem to have confidence in the ongoing environmental education and \r\nunderestimate the value of environmental education in comparison to other subjects like Japanese \r\nand mathematics. Teachers’ perceptions of environmental education have been shaped by the \r\nofficial discourse of environmental education, which has been widely accepted by common \r\npeople and environmental educators. A significant effect is the pervasive belief that \r\nenvironmental education can be conducted by an add-on approach. This generates the tendency to \r\nignore the fact that the curriculum itself has a deep cultural perspective on the human-nature \r\nrelationship, which is highly problematic from the point of view of environmental education.  \r\nIn conclusion, I strongly argue that environmental educators and school officials who accept \r\nthe importance of environmental education should comprehend the status quo of public \r\nelementary schools before turning over the responsibility of children’s education to teachers. \r\nJapan must build a society that affords the essential needs of education in order for teachers to \r\ngive all their time and energy for the children they are currently facing. Before teachers can \r\nconcentrate on environmental education, education officials, policymakers, and the public must \r\nunderstand the limitations of individual schools and teachers in relation to environmental \r\neducation within the present education system. I recommend that environmental educators pay \r\nheed to insiders’ voices and experiences, examine what the voices represent from a broader \r\nperspective, and make these findings the basis of future plans for environmental education." ],

  "title" : "Public Infrastructure Financing: An International Perspective",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Public Infrastructure Financing: An International Perspective", "General government investment in infrastructure has fallen in recent years for most of the countries in this study, (information is not available to assess whether this is true for public investment more generally). Nevertheless, overall investment in infrastructure has remained fairly steady in recent years, although volatile in some countries. Total Australian investment in infrastructure has rebounded in recent years to just below 6 per cent of GDP in 2006-07. Sub-national governments undertook 76 per cent of public infrastructure investment, with government trading enterprises accounting for around half of this. With the global financial crisis, governments are looking to infrastructure investment as a way of stimulating the economy. But financing options have also been constrained by the crisis. Financing decisions are separate from the investment decision and can be made independently. Financing differs from public funding - the latter being the commitment of public revenue to meet any gap between the costs of infrastructure provision and the revenue from user charges. Funding decisions carry an opportunity cost and deadweight loss of raising taxes. Budget appropriations, financed on a pay-as-you-go basis or from public debt, remain the major form of financing for government investment in infrastructure (63 per cent in 2006-07). Specific-purpose bonds, where repayment is linked to the performance of the asset, are a major source of finance in the United States and Canada, but were phased out in the 1980s in Australia. Public-private partnerships (PPP), where the government contracts a private partner to variously finance, design, build and operate infrastructure assets for a fixed period, are growing in use. Used extensively in the United Kingdom, in Australia they made up 6 per cent of public investment in 2006-07 - higher in New South Wales and Victoria. Some approaches used to finance public infrastructure can improve efficiency and lower the life-time project cost through - better management of project risk by aligning incentives for risk management with the capacity to manage the risk; improvements in information, contract negotiation and management and other transaction activities that pay-off in better risk management and cost savings; bringing greater market or other scrutiny to bear on the investment, and imposing the costs on potential beneficiaries to better reveal their willingness to pay. The most efficient financing vehicle will depend on the nature of the investment, the degree of asymmetry of information, the potential for competition, and the skills of the government as negotiators and contract managers. The potential for governments to shift risk onto private partners may be limited, and any non-diversifiable risk assumed by the private sector will be reflected in their required rates of return. PPPs offer considerable potential to reduce project risk, but are costly to transact. If such transactions are off-budget, this may inhibit the scrutiny needed to ensure efficient investment. The views expressed in this paper are those of the staff involved and do not necessarily reflect those of the Productivity Commission.public infrastructure, infrastructure financing, public-private partnerships, budget appropriations, specific-purpose bonds, risk management" ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Hölderlins Anschauungen vom Beruf des Dichters im Zusammenhang mit dem Stil seiner Dichtung: The conception of the poet in Hoelderlin, as revealed in the themes and style of his poetic works", "<p>The thesis is concerned with three main problems: (1) The derivation of Hoelderlin's conception of the Poet from the Renaissance tradition (2) The problems inherent in Hoelderlin's conception of the Poet (3) The relationship between Hoelderlin's conception of the Poet and the style of his poetic works. These questions are treated chronologically in their respective relevance to each stage in Hoelderlin's development. The first part of the thesis is devoted to the poet's early poetry, his novel \"Hyperion\", and his aesthetic theory as reflected in the various versions of that novel and in the philosophical fragments; the second part deals with the drama \"Empedokles\" and the mature poetry. For the purpose of this essay, however, it seems more practicable to abandon the purely chronological order and to discuss separately each of the three problems mentioned.</p><p>(1) Hoelderlin's conception of the Poet is based on the Greek Vates and the biblical Prophet. The importance of the classical and biblical traditions for Hoelderlin as well as the extent to which he was influenced by Klopstock and other German contemporaries have been stressed again and again; but the significance of the tradition linkng the centuries between antiquity and the 18th century has been neglected. This thesis attempts to fill the gap and to show that Hoelderlin's conception of the Poet is inconceivable without the gradual change in the cultural pattern brought about by the Renaissance. It it in the Renaissance that art (with philosophy) takes over part of the function formerly fulfilled by religion, that the inspired individual rather than the institution of the Church becomes the mediator between God and men, that the national community emerges from the international society of the Middle Ages, and that a transformation of the classical and Christian heritage takes place. All this is reflected in the Renaissance conception of the Poet as Vates and Prophet, who interprets history and brings a divine message to his people. From Boccaccio to Scaliger this conception occurs in all major Italian Renaissance works on poetic theory. Ronsard, as the first modern Poet-Vates, introduces it in France. In England Sidney expounds similar views, later to be realized in the personality and work of Milton. In Germany it is Hoelderlin's Suabian compatriot Weckherlin who emulates the example of Ronsard, while Opitz sums up the typical contemporary view of poetry in his standard German Renaissance Poetics. A century later Gottsched and Herder go back to Opitz for their interpretation of the sacred mission of poetry. The young Klopstock is influenced by Gottsched as well as by Milton. He, Herder, Schiller and the Suabian poets, humanists and pietists, hand on the tradition to Hoelderlin.</p><p>The idea, however, that the Poet is a Prophet would not be understandable without certain philosophical conceptions which were also developed by the Renaissance. Plato's theory of the \"furor poeticus\", commented on and interpreted in a neo-platonic way by Marsilio Ficino, is taken over by Ronsard and Opitz and blends with Giordano Bruno's and Shaftesbury's re-interpretation of neo-platonism and these influences join with Leibniz's monadology to shape German aesthetics in the 18th century. The conceptions then current reach Hoelderlin through Herder, Schiller, and Jacobi's book on Spinoza, which contained extracts from Bruno and Leibniz. Thus for Hoelderlin - as for his generation - God is the supreme artist, Beauty the very essence of the universe, the human soul a spark of the divine, and the Poet, according to Shaftesbury \"a second maker\", creates, like God himself, through the Word, the sacred Logos. These philosophical concepts both supplement and contradict Hoelderlin's view of the Poet as a Vates and Prophet. Equipped with the Renaissance heritage Hoelderlin arrives in Jena, the centre of German classicism and the cradle of romanticism. The impact of Kant, Fichte, Goethe, Schiller and Schelling on Hoelderlin and the reflection in his own philosophical writings of his contacts with these leading figures of contemporary letters are discussed in a separate chapter. In Hoelderlin's aesthetic theory the Renaissance conception of the Poet has been developed up to the point where it passes into romanticism. In this, Hoelderlin's place in German literature corresponds to that of Goethe. It is true, there is a vast difference which critics have rightly stressed. It is, however, one of the advantages of seeing Hoelderlin in the light of the Renaissance tradition that, in spite of differences, he appears as the contemporary of Goethe, the chief representative of the belated German Renaissance.</p><p>Just as Hoelderlin's conception of the Poet goes back to the Renaissance, so do many of his poetic themes, such as the parallels between Christ and Hercules, Christ and Bacchus, the invitation to the Greek Muses to visit Germany, the praise of the vernacular, his approach to nature and geography, etc.</p><p>(2) Hoelderlin's conception of the Poet is full of problems. They become first manifest in \"Hyperion\". The hero of this novel, a reflection of Hoelderlin himself, is the Poet, who in sublime visions sees divine Beauty, and the Vates who wants to free his people and rebuild Greece. As Vates he fails. He attributes his failure to the fact that the age is not ripe for his idealism, but it is also due to the conception of the Poet-Vates itself. As a Poet Hyperion delights in the very act of experiencing life in its joyful as well as tragic aspects, life revealing itself to him as a rhythmic whole which he calls Beauty and which is but the projection of the rhythm of human emotions into the universe. But the universe does not obey the laws of the human heart, nor does history; a \"theocracy\" cannot be founded on Beauty as Hyperion believes; his gift for experiencing deeply the joys and woes of life does not enable him to rebuild a new society - in short the Poet's vision does not prove to be the message of a Vates and Prophet. In the moment when, at the end of the novel, Hyperion is at the height of his poetic powers, he knows least how to serve his fellow men.</p><p>In \"Empedokles\" the problem of the Poet's function appears somewhat differently. The hero of the drama represents the highest form of genius the poet can conceive. He combines the \"Genie\" of the Storm and Stress period, Schiller's aesthetic artist, the mystical mediator between God and men, the Greek Titan, and it is also suggested that he is a kind of Christian saviour. This symbol of everything Hoelderlin worshipped in man has to die. It is in the various motivations of the death of Empedokles that Hoelderlin presents the problematical nature of genius. The most interesting point is the question of the guilt of genius. Empedokles is guilty of what is described in the thesis as pseudo-mystical approach to the Gods. The pseudo-mystical experience becomes linked with the problem of language, the very instrument of the Poet. In order to re-establish the right relationship between himself and the Gods, Empedokes has to die. But as he prepares for death he is once again re-united both with his people and with the Gods. It is at the expense of his life that he is allowed to be the Prophet who delivers a divine message unto his people. The end suggests that genius can be both, and almost at the same time, the culprit and the redeemer, a conception which Hoelderlin's theory of tragedy tries to justify. As regards the drama itself we are left with one the one hand the glorification of genius and on the other the dangers, the guilt, the tragic fate that go with genius.</p><p>The problem of genius is also the main theme of Hoelderlin's mature poetry. It is by singing of genii that he evokes the vast panorama of his later elegies, odes and hymns. There is a hierarchy of genii: from the gods and semi-gods of Greece to Christ, whom he tries to see as their brother, and from the various genii of nature and history, down to his own great contemporaries, his friends and the Poet himself. The Poet is celebrated, sometimes in dionysian rapture, as the Prophet, indeed the helper of the highest God, and as a companion of all the genii mentioned. This is one aspect of Hoelderlin's mature conception of the Poet. The other shows the reverse of this attitude. Like Hyperion the Poet is isolated. There is no holy community for which he sings. There is no unifed people for the Prophet to address. Hoelderlin's hope that his own age marks the beginning of the return of the Gods recedes more and more. The Gods have fled, they are slow to come back, and the poet becomes uncertain of his task. Like Empedokles he realizes the danger of a pseudo-mystical approach to the divine; if he wrote poetry without being ordered to do so by the Gods, he would feel like someone who answers without being asked; he is afraid of such impious misuse of language. In some of the late hymns Hoelderlin therefore resigns his great ambition of being a prophetic genius and ascribes to the Poet the much more modest task of an interpreter of tradition.</p><p>The renunciation, however, is not final. The dionysian exuberance of genius persists side by side with humble resignation. The dramatic tension between the two extremes is the very breath of life of his poetry. The dilemma, represented by these two opposed attitudes, springs from the absence of a unified pattern of civilisation. The modern Poet finds himself divorced from life and at the same time called upon to transgress the boundaries of his craft and himself to create the ethical standards and the religion which in reality are the prerequisite of literature. The Poet could not have been conceived of as the Prophet if he had still a definite, appropriate place to fill within a well defined whole, just as on the other hand he would not have dispaired of his usefulness. Both the overestimation and the underestimation of poetry are the outcome of the same situation. Hoelderlin, more than any other, was aware of the plight of the modern Poet.</p><p>(3) There is a close relationship between Hoelderlin's ideas and his style. What on the conscious level of thought appears as his conception of the Poet has its counterpart in the linguistic form of his poetic works. The impersonal, didactic character of his earliest poems, with their conventional mythology mainly drawn from the Bible, corresponds to his view, as yet purely traditional, of the Poet as the Prophet. The conception of the creative artist finds its reflection in the more dynamic quality of the Tuebinger hymns. The subsequent abandonment of the hymnic form in favour of the novel goes hand in hand with the emphasis on the personal vision rather than the prophetic message in \"Hyperion\". But just as the ideal of the Prophet and Vates remains in the background, so do the rhythms, parallelisms, and the mythological language. The latter blend with a new, personal mythological language. The world becomes a magnified image of the human heart, just as, on the level of thought, the same rhythm that governs man's emotions is held to be the rhythm that sustains the entire universe.</p><p>With \"Empedokles\" Hoelderlin has found his own unmistakable language. The style of that drama as well as of the mature poetry is seen to consist of two main elements: the statement of what is termed \"facts\" and the poet's running commentary on the \"facts\". The \"facts\" are data which lie beyond the poet's purely personal experience, and form a framework of fixed symbols. A great many of those symbols are fragments of ancient Greek and biblical mythology. They are charged with emotions and ethos. The astounding force with which Hoelderlin conjurs up some of those ancient figures is due to the primitive, childlike immediacy of his vision, which is analysed in detail. Hoelderlin uses those \"facts\" in order to give his work a firm support from tradition, as to him the Poet's task is not to express personal experiences but to deliver a message. However, his choice from tradition is fragmentary, as he can accept neither the Greek nor the biblical outlook on life in their entirety. After all, he is not an ancient Prophet or Vates with a definite faith, he is a modern poet in search of an attitude to life. This search is reflected in the running commentary which forms the link between the isolated statements of \"facts\". Hoelderlin's commentary is most complex; it embraces several and often contradictory layers of experience. It follows the laws of co-ordination, association and contrast rather than those of perspective, and does not attempt to order its material from one fixed viewpoint. In this, as well as in the combination of a system of symbols and a complex network of relationships between the symbols, it foreshadows some types of modern poetry - only that, unlike those of most modern poets, Hoelderlin's symbols are not purely personal ones. His retention of fragments of tradition, as well as his endeavour to invest them with new meaning by arranging them into his own personal patterns, reflect his attempt to be a modern Vates. The eventual failiure to master his visions, the growing accumulation of contradictory sentences and conjunctions are the linguistic expression of his conflict with regard to his poetic vocation.</p><p>To sum up, Hoelderlin is not a prophet in the accepted sense of the word. It is characteristic of the biblical prophet to deliver a definitive message directed towards action. Hoelderlin - and the poet in general - does not tell men how to act. His function is to bring into consciousness ever new layers of human experience and to express them by means of language. In doing so he helps to shape the language, i.e. the consciousness, of future generations. It is in this very special sense that the poet's task may be described as a prophetic one.</p>" ],

The aim of this\nstudy was to apply molecular biological techniques for identification and enumeration of\nnanoflagellate taxa in water samples.\nRestriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of small subunit\nribosomal DNA (SSU rONA) amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\ndifferentiated pure cultures of heterotrophic nanoflagellates according to established\ntaxonomic classification at the generic and species level. In addition, RFLP analysis of\namplified SSU rONA permitted discrimination of polymorphic forms among species of\nflagellates from the genus Paraphysomonas.\nA fluorescent in situ hybridization method that uses rRNA-targeted\noligonucleotide probes for counting protists from cultures and environmental water\nsamples was developed. Preserved cells were intensely labeled with multiple eukaryote-specific oligonucleotide probes end-labeled with biotin and detected by\nfluorescein (FITC)-avidin. This probe hybridization method gave estimates of\nnanoplankton abundances that were often more representative of natural abundances than\nestimates obtained by commonly employed fluorochrome stains.\nThe geographical distribution and seasonal abundance of the cosmopolitan\nheterotrophic flagellate, Paraphysomonas imperforata was examined in coastal waters\nusing species-specific oligonucleotide probes. P. imperforata was found to occur at\nextremely low abundances in coastal environments, constituting ≤1% of the TNAN.\nHowever, P. imperforata often dominated the nanoplankton (up to 98% of TNAN) when\nwater samples were enriched with bacteria. P. imperforata appears to be an\nopportunistic species capable of growing rapidly to high abundances when prey are\nabundant. Water temperature, small differences in the absolute abundance of P.\nimperforata, and nanoplankton grazers appeared to play a role in determining P.\nimperforata dominance. Results from this study also suggest that enrichment cultivation\nor perhaps incubations in general can select for nanoflagellates such as P. imperforata\nthat may not be representative of abundant oceanic species.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution March 199" ],

It then explores the nature of disciplinary 'for practice' education and sets out the extensive range of presumptions which often underlies the relationship between education and practice. Examining the current relationship between disciplinary education and tertiary studies, the paper looks at critical inquiry and disciplinary research, before focusing on competing institutional values and their operational and material consequences.

Methods We used genome, exome, and Sanger sequencing to analyze the genetic variability in TREM2 in a series of 1092 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 1107 controls (the discovery set). We then performed a meta-analysis on imputed data for the TREM2 variant rs75932628 (predicted to cause a R47H substitution) from three genomewide association studies of Alzheimer's disease and tested for the association of the variant with disease. We genotyped the R47H variant in an additional 1887 cases and 4061 controls. We then assayed the expression of TREM2 across different regions of the human brain and identified genes that are differentially expressed in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and in control mice. Results We found significantly more variants in exon 2 of TREM2 in patients with Alzheimer's disease than in controls in the discovery set (P=0.02). There were 22 variant alleles in 1092 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 5 variant alleles in 1107 controls (P<0.001). The most commonly associated variant, rs75932628 (encoding R47H), showed highly significant association with Alzheimer's disease (P<0.001). Meta-analysis of rs75932628 genotypes imputed from genomewide association studies confirmed this association (P=0.002), as did direct genotyping of an additional series of 1887 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 4061 controls (P<0.001). Trem2 expression differed between control mice and a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.

Disruption to the ventricular t-tubule network occurs in various cardiac pathologies and leads to heterogeneous changes of [Ca(2+)]i which are thought to contribute to the reduced contractility and increased susceptibility to arrhythmias of the diseased ventricle. Here we review evidence that, despite the long-held dogma of atrial cells having no or very few t-tubules, there is indeed an extensive and functionally significant t-tubule network present in atrial myocytes of large mammals including human. Moreover, the atrial t-tubule network is highly plastic in nature and undergoes far more extensive remodelling in heart disease than is the case in the ventricle with profound consequences for the resulting systolic Ca(2+) transient. In addition to considering the functional role of the t-tubule network in the healthy and diseased atria we also provide an overview of recent data concerning the putative factors controlling the formation of t-tubules and conclude by posing some important questions that currently remain to be addressed and whether or not targeting t-tubules offers potential novel therapeutic possibilities for heart disease." ],

  "texts" : [ "Exploring Differences: How SMEs Respond to Environmental Regulation", "Interview data from a sample of manufacturing small and medium enterprises (SMEs) confirm, at an aggregate level, that traditional regulation is an important driver of environmental behaviour. Further analysis, however, shows that, in addition to this aggregate picture, there are groups of firms that respond to regulation in different ways. Moreover, alongside the aggregate and group level pictures, differences exist across individual firms. Thus, SMEs respond in different ways to regulation, despite there being sufficient similarities across clusters of firms that we can group them thematically into “populations” (or groups of individual firms). These differences are explained by firms having different ‘capacities’ and ‘orientations’, which determine their receptiveness to different regulatory arrangements. This is important for at least three reasons. First, it provides a more sophisticated account of SME regulatory behaviour than existed formerly. Second, it helps us to understand more fully why a one-size-fits-all approach will not work and why specific regulatory measures may underperform. Third, it provides a basis for reshaping approaches so they can better accommodate different rule-following conduct." ],

Method: An anonymous survey distributed to the staff in the department of psychiatry and psychotherapy at the Freiburg University Hospital. The main predictor variable was the spirituality of staff using DRI (Duke Religion Index). The main criterion variables were the relevance of religiosity/spirituality of patients and staff’s attitude towards religious/spiritual contents during their therapy using the questionnaire of Curlin et al. Results: The spirituality of staff was 6.91 on a scale of 12.0. There was no significant relationship between variables. Staff regarded the influence of religious/spiritual contents generally positive to patients. However, the staff did not use religious/spiritual elements in their therapy methods. Frequent reasons were insufficient time/occasion and insufficient knowledge. Conclusions: Religious/spiritual contents have not been integrated yet in therapy methods, although they are regarded as important for patients. Further studies and discussion about religious/spiritual matters are essential for their integration into psychiatric therapies in order to overcome these inconsistencies" ],

  "texts" : [ "Wertschöpfung in der zeitgenössischen Kunst: Zur „Young German Art“", "The value of an artwork depends not only on the artist, even more so on the system which is adding and increasing its value. This system contains a number of institutions which are supporting the artist and his works to become established in the market, get internationally renowned and as a consequence raise his \"value\". Nowadays not the paintings themselves —   their subject or quality — are the most important issues for the artist's career: The biography is the determining factor: Where did the artist study? Which gallery is representing the artist? Where did the artist exhibit? Which museum shows the artist’s works? Which collectors are buying the art works? Who criticized and reviewed the artist? This framework is exogenous for an artist, and it helps very well to value the quality and the price of an artist’s work. Only by these value determining impacts within the biography of an artist, it is possible to describe and understand why art works by established and expansive artists were low-priced in the beginning of their career.\n\nThis paper describes theoretically and by example the value-added activities of selected artists of the “Young German Art”. It discusses how artists, gallery owners, museums, collectors and critics act on the contemporary art market und how they influence the value of artworks and how vice versa the art market reacts back. How do the most decisive and value determining leaders in this field influence the market? How is a certain value judgment of an artist created? \n\nToday, the label “Young German Art” is commonly used to describe the new contemporary figurative painting from Germany abroad. The label “Made in Germany” has already been established both as seal of quality and a trademark for visual arts. The contemporary artists Gerhard RICHTER, Sigmar POLKE, Anselm KIEFER, Georg BASELITZ, A.R. PENCK and Joseph BEUYS were some of the personalities who contributed a big amount to that success of the following generations of the “Young German Art”. \n\nThe label “Young German Art” – YGA – has its origin in its British pattern, the “Young British Art” (YBA), and was adopted by the German art market during international art fairs by German gallery owners since the mid-1990’s. During the Armory Show in New York, German gallery owners erected signs with the title “Young German Art”. After that the foreign press adopted this label and distributed it worldwide. Especially the Leipzig School respectively the New Leipzig School belongs to “Young German Art”. Since the 1990’s, this School describes figurative painting from Leipzig. It's most famous painters are amongst others Neo RAUCH, Tim EITEL und Matthias WEISCHER. Foremost Daniel RICHTER and Norbert BISKY are the flagships of the „Young German Art“. In Germany all of them are exclusively under contract to three Berlin galleries. \n\nThis paper starts with a definition of art und its various kinds of value-systems: historic-cultural, aesthetic, tangible and economical. It looks at a definition and theoretical explanation of the art market and the various characteristics of market inefficiencies and market failures. Because market inefficiencies and market failures on the art market are primary initiated by information asymmetries, this paper also analyses some approaches for solutions offered by the new institutional economics und the contract theory.\n\nThe main part of this paper relates to the value adding processes in the contemporary art market. It explains all relevant and determining players and institutions and their goals, in focusing on artists, galleries, art fairs, museums and other institutions. Furthermore this paper discusses the role of art collectors and art consultants and various kinds of adding value to artworks. Within this framework of theoretical analysis, five artists of the “Young German Art” are discussed in detail, on behalf of their works, their collectors, auction results and choice of the most important international art prizes." ],

  "texts" : [ "Improving Design of Micro-business Systems via VSM and Constituent Orientation Analysis", "<p>This paper describes recent design research into prototypical ‘classes’ of designs for operational business systems for micro-businesses of 1-10 employees typical of traditional craft and contemporary information economies. </p>\n<p>\nBusiness process design is an increasingly important and relatively new sub-field of design and design research. Its increasing importance is driven by three factors made more potent by information technology: increasing ability for very small business units to contribute to local and national economies; potential for increased efficiency of micro-businesses via reduction in Coasian transaction costs; increasingly competitive business environments leading to pressure on micro-businesses to deeply cut costs; and increased potential for improved design of micro-business processes to create significant benefits for the micro-businesses themselves and to local and national economies.</p>\n<p>\nThe analyses used in this paper combine Tellefsen's perspective on constituent orientation with Beerian Viable System analysis and Cashflow Quadrant analysis (Beer, 1972, 1988, 1989, 1995; Kiyosaki & Lechter, 2007; Tellefsen, 1995, 1999, 2001; Tellefsen & Love, 2003). These analyses are used to identify promising foci of design effort particularly with the intention of automating and systematizing business activities.</p>\n<p>\nThe paper first describes the importance of developing improved guidelines for design of organisational structures and business processes in the micro-business arena. It then outlines the structural, humanistic, financial, business management and computerized automation considerations that need to be addressed. Design issues are illustrated via mini case studies of three characteristic micro-businesses in the areas of publishing, plumbing, and rental investment. The paper shows how improvements to the design of business processes can be viewed through how four constituent orientations: <br />\n•\tSelf employed <br />\n•\tBusiness managers <br />\n•\tBusiness owners <br />\n•\tInvestors <br />\nThe paper concludes by integrating the outcomes of the above analyses into a preliminary checklist for the design of effective and efficient automated and systematized business processes for micro-businesses and small business enterprises.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Keywords:</strong> <br />\nBusiness Process Design, Micro-Business, Viable Systems, Constituent Orientation, Cashflow Quadrant Analysis.</p>" ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Eco-literacy : the \"missing paradigm\" in environmental education", "This thesis is about the knowledge and beliefs of primary school teachers. The study is aimed at assessing the scope and range of Queensland primary school teachers' knowledge and beliefs about environmental education. More specifically, the thesis addresses a perceived gap within environmental education research and literature which, to date, fails to provide an elaborate account of Australian primary school teachers' knowledge about and beliefs towards environmental education.\nIn Chapter One, the Background to the Study and Review of Literature, I present an overview of the various international environmental education policy developments and initiatives, and reveal that there are established goals, objectives and principles for environmental education. In Australia, environmental education policies have been developed, although state departments have been slow to incorporate environmental education into key curriculum documents. Environmental education is predominately incorporated into and practised through existing curriculum areas; principally the 'Studies of Society and the Environment' (SOSE) key learning area. The implications of concentrating environmental education into specific curriculum domains are yet to be fully explored.\nThere are a variety of disparate views about the proper role of environmental education. In Australia, the dominant approaches are: education about the environment, education in (or through) the environment and education for the environment. For the past two decades education for the environ-ment has been identified by particular proponents in the field as the preferred approach for environ-mental education. Notwithstanding, there is a growing number of researchers who argue that education for the environment is theoretically and conceptually flawed. Four issues have been identified as the basis of these criticisms. These are: its indoctrination and anthropocentric tendencies; its definitive usage of the concept sustainable development; its inappropriate use of social-critical theory; and the lack of empirical research concerning the implementation of education for the environment in schools. To this end, I argue that the field of environmental education is characterized by theoretical assumptions, flaws and contradictions and a dearth of empirical research.\nTo this extent, little is known about the extent to which environmental education has been incorporated into school systems, particularly in primary schools. Despite the various policy advancements in environ-mental education, the evaluation studies that have been conducted indicate that policy expectations are rarely met. There are many barriers which impede the implementation of environmental education, namely: time and resource constraints for teachers; lack of teacher knowledge and skills; lack of knowledge of departmental regulations regarding environmental education; and differences and gaps between the theories (with respect to environmental education) held by policy makers, curriculum developers and educational researchers and the theories held by practitioners. In this way, environmental education research has tended to conclude that the provision of further or restructured teacher education is the 'priority of priorities' for environmental education. However, such propositions tend to be based on both a lack of empirical evidence and a flawed theoretical presumption that environmental education and the structure, politics and organisation of school systems are unprob-lematic.\nThe identified theoretical and empirical 'gaps' formulated the impetus and justification of this study. In so doing, Chapter Two presents a theoretical framework for the thesis problem set out in Chapter One. This framework is utilised later in the thesis for the interpretation, analysis and synthesis of data reported in Chapter Four. The theoretical framework establishes links between the major concepts of teachers' knowledge, teachers' beliefs and environmental education. As such, complex pedagogical content knowledge underpins the conceptual framework of this thesis, which is positioned within a theoretical model based upon ecoliteracy and adaptive management. Eco-literacy comprises complex pedagogical knowledge centred on ecological, sociological and educational concepts. Adaptive management, in addition, shows what happens with individual learners and the capacities of teachers with the practical interest of conceptualising how an ecologically literate population might be developed through participation in an education system.\nChapter Three outlines the combined-methods approach utilised to investigate primary school teachers' knowledge and beliefs (eco-literacy) about environmental education. To this extent, the methodological approach consisted of two stages. For stage one, a total of twenty-six primary school teachers volunteered and partici-pated in one intensive ethnographic interview. So as to elucidate the findings discovered in the stage one phase of data collection, a quantitative survey (stage two) was administered in five Education Queensland state primary school districts.\nIn Chapter Four I present and analyse the data collected in 'Stage One' and 'Stage Two' of this study. The data are presented in four sections, namely: Teachers' Preparedness; Teachers' Knowledge; Teachers' Beliefs; and Correlating Teachers' Preparedness, Knowledge & Beliefs - A Path Analysis. In short, the data revealed that the participants: had received no or very little in-service and/or pre-service training in environmental education; possessed mis-conceptions and simple understandings of environmental education and environmental concepts; either did not practise environmental education or practised it incidentally through curriculum areas such as Studies of Society and Environment; did not consider it a priority in their teaching or in schooling generally; perceived time constraints, over-crowded curriculum, constant change and ongoing pro-fessional demands as the major barriers preventing and/or limiting the implementation of environmental education; revealed a general concern for the environment, although various views about the environ-mental crisis were apparent (between stage one and stage two); and displayed a range of environ-mental philosophies, with participants agreeing most with the 'Ecocentric Eco-socialist' and 'Ecocentric Gaia' perspectives. Essentially, the participants' knowledge, beliefs and amount of in-service training significantly influenced their priority for and level of intention to implement environmental education in the primary school classroom. Significant trends are also reported between male and female teachers of different age-groups.\nIn Chapter Five I synthesis the data, presented in Chapter Four, in relation to the theoretical framework and overall research problem. Based upon the data presented, I contend that current primary school teachers are likely to be functioning at a level of eco-illiteracy and/or nominal eco-literacy. I conclude that the introduction of eco-literacy in educational policy and the espousal of adaptive management strategies may advance the goals of environmental education, although such initiatives are unlikely to significantly change the current 'status' of environmental education unless there is a system-wide commitment to environmental education and knowledge management on the part of governments, education departments, pre-service and in-service teacher education providers, schools and teachers themselves." ],

However, this ‘glow of health’ display remains poorly understood. We found that feeding of probiotic bacteria to aged mice induced integumentary changes mimicking peak health and reproductive fitness characteristic of much younger animals. Eating probiotic yogurt triggered epithelial follicular anagen-phase shift with sebocytogenesis resulting in thick lustrous fur due to a bacteria-triggered interleukin-10-dependent mechanism. Aged male animals eating probiotics exhibited increased subcuticular folliculogenesis, when compared with matched controls, yielding luxuriant fur only in probiotic-fed subjects. Female animals displayed probiotic-induced hyperacidity coinciding with shinier hair, a feature that also aligns with fertility in human females. Together these data provide insights into mammalian evolution and novel strategies for integumentary health." ],

  "texts" : [ "Barriers and opportunities for small and medium-sized Thai food firms in the context of innovation management: The case of processed marine and processed fruit and vegetable sectors", "This dissertation deals with barriers and opportunities for small and medium sized Thai food firms in the context of innovation management, based on the case of processed marine and processed fruit and vegetable sectors, which are the main revenue contributors to the Thai food processing industry. Nature of firm innovation, barriers to innovations, main innovation activities, firm innovation performance, and the relationship between innovations and firm business performance of Thai food SMEs are all discussed in this study. The thesis aims to help SME entrepreneurs in the food industry to better foster innovations and also provides guidelines for policy makers to craft effective innovation policy for food SMEs. Additionally, it provides academic insight into the field of innovation management in the environment of Thai SMEs, where gaps in the literature exist.This research was achieved by the triangulation approach, which is a combination of quantitative and qualitative research techniques (i.e. document analysis, multiple-regression analysis, case studies) and was guided by a conceptual framework adapted from studies of innovation management, barriers to innovation, and innovation in the food industry. The literature review was first conducted, followed by pilot interviews in a semi-structured format with 10 Thai food firms, structured face-to-face interviews with 100 Thai food SMEs, and case studies with 4 Thai food SMEs. The findings of this research reveal that innovation can lead to improved firm business performance for Thai food SMEs, although this is a complex process, propelled by numerous factors, and overall innovation performance achieved by most survey firms was still low. During the innovation development phase, it appeared that most innovation activities in the survey food firms were driven informally on an in-house basis, and process-innovation activities were the main focus. Product innovations, however, were the main output in the phase of innovation deployment, followed by process and marketing innovations, while organisational innovations were the most overlooked area for most Thai food SMEs in this phase.  However, it was process and marketing innovations that were the key determinants of overall firm growth in the surveyed food firms. Finally, investigations of the main barriers to developing innovations encountered by Thai food SMEs show that it was product innovation that was most seriously affected by a number of serious barriers to innovation. Resistance to change by customers, for instance, was one of the main obstacles impeding the product innovation efforts of sampled Thai food SMEs.  Meanwhile, the development of process and marketing innovations was mainly hampered by the problems of weak employee skills and a lack of finance. A shortage of time on the part of decision makers was the most serious barrier to developing organisational innovations." ],

  "texts" : [ "The contribution of snacking to the diets of freshman college women", "The nutritional impact of snacking on the diets of female,\r\nfreshman college students between the ages of 17 and 20 years was\r\nassessed. Sixty-five women living in freshman residence halls at\r\nOregon State University recorded their dietary intakes and eating\r\nhabits for four days. Questionnaires concerning eating and activity\r\npatterns were also completed. Dietary intakes were analyzed for\r\nenergy (kcal), protein, calcium, iron, vitamin A, thiamin, riboflavin,\r\nniacin and ascorbic acid. The nutrient contents of snacks, meals,\r\nand nutrient supplements consumed by the subjects were calculated.\r\nNutrient densities (nutrient/1000 kcal) of meals and snacks were\r\nalso calculated for the above nutrients. All subjects received a\r\nDietary Adequacy Score, which was computed from their mean daily intake\r\nover the four-day period, by assigning one point for each\r\nnutrient consumed at or above two-thirds of the RDA.\r\nAll but one subject snacked during the four-day recording\r\nperiod. The subjects consumed a mean of 1.54 snacks daily, with\r\nmeans of 0.19 morning, 0.47 afternoon, and 0.88 evening snacks.\r\nWith the exception of ascorbic acid, the mean nutrient desities\r\nof snacks were significantly (p<0.01) lower than that of meals. The\r\nmean nutrient densities of snacks were well below the RDA/1000 kcal\r\nfor all of the calculated nutrients, again, with the exception of\r\nascorbic acid. Snacks contributed about 20 percent of the mean\r\ntotal energy intake; the proportions supplied by snacks to the mean\r\nnutrient intakes were considerably lower (8 to 13 percent).\r\nMeal frequency was negatively correlated with snack frequency\r\n(r= -.24, p<0.05) and snack energy intake (r= -.40, p<0.01). Lunch\r\nwas the meal most negatively correlated with snacking frequency\r\n(r = .33, p<0.01) and snack energy intake ( r= -.37, p<0.01). By\r\nexamining when snacking and when missed meals occurred, it appears\r\nthat snacks were often consumed as a result of missed meals rather\r\nthan the cause of them. Breakfast was missed most often and dinner\r\nleast often with snacking occurring most often in the evening and\r\nafternoon. Snacks consumed at these times would not have interfered\r\nwith either lunch or breakfast.\r\nDespite the relatively poor nutritional value of snack foods\r\neaten by the subjects (as evidenced by the low nutrient densities),\r\nsnacks actually improved the Dietary Adequacy Scores of 28 subjects.\r\nHowever, 16 subjects exceeded the RDA for energy with the addition of\r\nsnacks, eight of whom were not included in the above group of 28\r\nwith the improved Dietary Adequacy Scores. But in all, 20 subjects\r\n(31 percent) had their Dietary Adequacy Scores improved by snacks,\r\nwithout exceeding the 2100 kcal RDA for energy.\r\nThe foods most commonly eaten as snacks were (in descending\r\norder): cookies, cake and pastries; candy; fruit; dairy desserts;\r\npopcorn; crackers, chips etc.; soft drinks; and alcoholic beverages." ],

The current fragmentation of the study of ‘literary epigraphy’ calls for a volume which will bring together literary, historical and epigraphical approaches to the subject. The subject of ‘literary epigraphy’ offers much to epigraphers, ancient historians, literary scholars, but also invites us to rethink the nature of epigraphy itself: it contributes to a broader understanding of the nature and reception of epigraphy in the Graeco-Roman world. Bringing the conclusions of our contributors together, this introduction maintains that ancient encounters with inscriptions, preserved through the literary record, offer us a view of the ways in which inscriptions offered a physical and cultural backdrop for activities of all kinds; they offer us valuable insight into individuals’ reaction towards inscriptions and their manipulation of them. Both epigraphy and the idea of epigraphy offered, in antiquity, a pliable tool for claiming, maintaining and demonstrating authority, identity, morality, and power." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Religion and Health: An Examination of the Effect of Religiosity on Health", "IntroductionOne of the issues in the field of sociology that has attracted the attention of many social scientists is the important role of social determinants in human health. In spite of the significant progress of medical sciences in identification of pathogeneses and treatment methods, sociologists are interested in the study of health and illness and identification of the effective factors. The results of sociological studies indicate that health is multi-faceted, and may be affected by cultural, economic and social factors in addition to biological factors. Most of medical sociologists believe that social factors play an important role in human health; biological and medical explanations, which ignore the significant role of social and cultural factors on health and illness patterns, are insufficient. This has led sociologists to study the social and cultural determinants of health. This research aims to investigate the effect of some social and cultural determinants such as religiosity, healthy lifestyle and level of social support on health among university students. The present study examines the direct and indirect effect of religiosity on health. As a variable, health has been investigated in three physical, mental and social dimensions. The indirect effect of religiosity on health has been studied through social support and healthy lifestyle. In order to study the relationship between religiosity and health, theories of Emile Durkheim, Kingsley Davis, Milton Yinger, Thomas O'Dea’s functionalism theory, and Max Weber and Peter Berger’s meaning theories have been utilized. Each of these approaches has implications for the relationship between religiosity and health. According to the functionalists, religion unifies society and preserves social integration. Also, religion provides a background for integration and categorizes people according to special ideology in peer social groups. This categorization could be a factor for promotion of intergroup integration against outer groups that follow different opinions and ideas. On the other hand, in relation to the research question, Berger and Weber's approach also seems important. According to these theorists religion, in addition to other functions, provides a meaningful and purposeful life in a world that is constantly meaningless. According to Weber, regardless of level of rationality in the society, individuals have a psychological need to find the world meaningful and purposeful. As a result of his view, religion is not functionless in the modern era. So from Weber’s point of view, it can be inferred that even in new forms of society religiosity can have a positive effect on health. Therefore, religious people that are more likely to control their carnal desires show less risky behavior and as a result, they may have a healthier life. In general, implication of functionalists and meaning theorists can be shown in a causal model as a theoretical model of this study as follow: Figure 1- Conceptual Model of the Study Based on the proposed model and the review of literature, the following hypotheses can be reasonably inferred from:1. Religiosity has a positive effect on healthy lifestyle.2. Religiosity has a positive effect on social support.3. Social support has a positive effect on healthy lifestyle.4. Healthy lifestyle has a positive effect on health.5. Social support has a positive effect on health.6. Religiosity has a positive effect on health.Materials and MethodsIn this research, a survey method was used to investigate the relationship between variables. It was performed based on a sample of 350 students of the University of Tabriz. Participants filled out a questionnaire containing mental, physical and social health measures (i.e., HS-36). Also, it contained measures for healthy lifestyles and social support as intervening variables and for religiosity as an independent variable. The measures enjoyed a high level of reliability and validity.FindingsFindings reveal that religiosity, healthy lifestyle, and social support have significant positive correlations with physical, mental, and social health and consequently with the general measure of health. In addition, the results of multivariate regression analysis reveal that these independent variables explain 36.8% of variance of general measure of health. However, the explained variance of mental health and social health (respectively, 31.2% and 32.6%) are almost twice as that of the physical health. Furthermore, the results of path analysis indicate that religiosity significantly and positively has both direct and indirect effects on general and mental health. Religiosity has also a significant indirect effect through social support and healthy lifestyle on physical and social health but it has no direct effect on these two dimensions of health. In general, the findings support the implications of functionalist theories on the positive effect of religion on healthy lifestyle and health, particularly mental and social health.     Discussion of Results and ConclusionIn summary it can be said that the results of different statistical tests to examine the relationship between religiosity and health indicate that religiosity has a significant impact on promotion of health and its dimensions. According to the mentioned theoretical discussions concerning the relationship between religiosity and health, these results were expected. Indeed, the findings confirm these theories. According to these theories, the positive effect of religiosity on health and its dimensions can be explained through integration, ascetic and meaning functions of religion. A) Integration Function of ReligionAccording to the functionalists, religion unifies society, preserves social integration and motivates social unity. According to this approach, religious thoughts based on communicating and interacting with others extensively, make religious people incline to develop social relationships and social support. As a result, this leads to receiving lots of support from relatives and friends. On the other hand the extension of religion in society has caused religious people to join religious networks in addition to family, relatives, friends and occupational networks and hence have larger social networks than less religious people. Therefore, the expansion of social communications and joining diverse social networks provides a background for receiving social support for religious people. Accordingly, religion plays a positive role in promotion of social health by expanding religious people’s supportive networks.B) Meaning Function of ReligionAlthough Weber and Berger, like functionalists, emphasize on social functions of religion but they consider meaning function of religion. Based on this approach, by offering spiritual responses to human ultimate questions, making life purposeful, and coping with problems, religion acts as an obstacle to human meaningless crisis. As a result, the religious people that are less suffering from meaninglessness and aimlessness can better cope with difficulties and have mental peace and comfort. Therefore, the findings of the present study confirms the mentioned theories concerning to the positive effect of religiosity on mental health.C) Ascetic Function of ReligionAnother implication of Weber and Berger’s theory regarding the relationship between religion and health is the positive effect of religiosity on physical health. These theorists’ approaches imply that religion is an important factor to control the instinctive desires. Participating in religious ceremonies causes religious people to control their carnal desires.So the findings of the present study based on a positive and significant relationship between religion and health confirm that ascetic content of religion about controlling carnal desires and avoiding illegal affairs causes religious people to control their instinctive desires and prevents them from high-risk behaviors and consequently is more physically health" ],

  "texts" : [ "Routing algorithms in networks with the topology of circulant graphs", "The thesis \"Routing algorithms in networks with the topology of \r\ncirculant graphs\" investigates topological properties of circulant \r\ngraphs and their application to computer data exchange.\r\n\r\nCirculant graphs are undirected vertex transitive graphs with n vertices \r\nand edges of length hi, (i=1, 2, ..., k). When selecting an appropriate \r\ntopology for a computer network, circulant graphs represent an \r\nintermediate choice between simple but unreliable ring topology and \r\nreliable but expensive (and sometimes technologically unfeasible) fully \r\nconnected topology. Due to their favorable properties--among which are \r\nsymmetry, scalability, reliability, small diameter, and small average \r\nnode distance,--circulant graphs are widely studied as suitable \r\ntopologies for local area networks and parallel computer architectures. \r\nThey have been efficiently used in ILLIAC IV, FDDI-token, SILK and SONET \r\nrings, Intel Paragon, Cray T3D, MPP, and MICROS.\r\n\r\nRouting algorithms are used to solve data exchange problems in computer \r\nnetworks. Data (i.e. a message) is split into several packages. The task \r\nof a routing algorithm is to transfer the packages along the network \r\nedges to their final destination and then to combine them into original \r\nmessage. There are two types of routing algorithms. Static routing \r\nalgorithms determine the path for each packet in the preprocessing phase \r\n(i.e. before the actual start of routing); dynamic routing algorithms \r\nperform all the necccessary routing calculations on-the-fly. After the \r\npreprocessing phase the routing algorithm makes several successive \r\nrouting steps. In each routing step the algorithm can move a packet from \r\nits current node to one of the neighboring nodes. Routing algorithms can \r\nbe used to solve various routing problems. A two-terminal routing is a \r\nproblem where only one package has to be routed from its source to its \r\nfinal destination. Routing algorithms for this problem aim to route a \r\npackage along one of its shortest paths. Much more complicated situation \r\noccurs when more than one package is present in the network. In this \r\ncase, which is also known as the general routing problem, a routing \r\nalgorithm tries to route all the packages to their final destination in \r\nas few as possible routing steps.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis we first introduce the wide area of our work. We \r\nextensively explain the meaning of the following terms: network, routing \r\nmodel, routing problem, routing algorithm. We also present the criteria \r\nfor measuring the quality of a given routing algorithm. In the following \r\nthere are two main chapters. The first one is dedicated to the selected \r\ntopology (i.e. circulant graphs) and the second one to the routing \r\nalgorithms designed and tested for this topology.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter dedicated to circulant graphs we first summarize the \r\nknown results and the most important topological properties. Then we \r\npresent a method for solving certain problems (such as calculating the \r\ndiameter and calculating the shortest paths) by reduction to integer \r\nlattice in which a point represents a walk in a graph. We introduce the \r\nnotion of minimal projection and give the corresponding algorithm to \r\nconstruct it. We present the integer lattice as a module, define the \r\nnotion of packed basis, and present two algorithms for calculating it. \r\nThen we introduce and prove several important features concerning \r\nvectors of packed basis. We also introduce a new topology, the so called \r\nsemi-directed circulant graphs, and present an O(log n) algorithm for \r\ncalculating the shortest paths between nodes in these graphs. The proof \r\nof correctness for this algorithm, which calculates the shortest paths \r\nby using the minimal projection along the vectors of packed basis, is \r\nbased on the properties of packed basis proved in earlier sections. We \r\nalso present some k-generalizations of the algorithms presented for \r\n2-circulant graphs.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on the routing in circulant graphs we first present two \r\nrouting algorithms for the two-terminal routing problem (static and \r\ndynamic version). Then we present a parameterized model used to describe \r\nrouting algorithms and give five parameter-sets of five static routing \r\nalgorithms for the general routing problem. We also describe a dynamic \r\nalgorithm for the general routing problem and compare the efficiency of \r\nthis algorithm with the best static one. At the end of the chapter we \r\npresent a generalization of a routing algorithm for general k-circulant \r\ngraphs.\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter of the thesis we give some open questions and ideas \r\nfor future work." ],

  "title" : "Bioconversion of biodiesel by-products to value-added chemicals",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Bioconversion of biodiesel by-products to value-added chemicals", "To mitigate the problems of depleting and soaring price of fossil fuels, the production and use of renewable energy have been vigorously promoted. In Europe, the role of biologically-derived fuels and in particular biodiesel is gradually increasing in prominent. Rapeseed biodiesel is the most widely produced in Europe. As a consequence, enormous amount of by-products from production processes are being generated. Current strategies for managing these by-products (mainly rapeseed meal and crude glycerol) seem not to be economically sustainable. More efficient utilisation could add more value to the production chain which in turn would raise the competitiveness of biodiesel compared to petro-diesel. The aim of the project reported in this thesis was to study the feasibility of producing a value added product, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), from by-products generated from rapeseed biodiesel production processes as well as to investigate the effects of methanol, a major impurity in crude glycerol, on growth of Cupriavidus necator, a PHB-producing micro-organism.The preliminary study of C. necator growth in crude glycerol based media revealed that optimum concentration of crude glycerol was in a range 15-25 g/L. It was also found that slight changes in the carbon to nitrogen ratio of the feedstock did not significantly affect the growth while methanol at concentrations beyond 10 g/L did. A model based on a saturation equation was developed and used to successfully predict the inhibition of growth by methanol. From the developed model, mechanisms of the inhibition were proposed. The model could also be used to predict satisfactorily growth or productivity rates in other systems containing short-chain alcohols. The growth in solutions derived from rapeseed meal (designated as hydrolysate) via solid-state fermentation by Aspergillus oryzae followed by hydrolysis of the fermented solids was also studied. The biomass production was found to increase as a function of initial free amino nitrogen (FAN) concentration presented in the hydrolysate. However, at higher initial FAN concentrations, a lower conversion of nitrogen to biomass was observed. PHB production was studied using a feedstock which was a mixture of the hydrolysate and crude glycerol. Total biomass concentration reached 28.8 g/L at 120 h with 86% PHB content. PHB productivity and PHB yield on glycerol were 0.21 g/L•h and 0.32 g/g respectively. These results were comparable with those obtained when pure glycerol and synthetic crude glycerol were used, suggesting that, technically, the use of the generic rapeseed- and crude glycerol-based feedstock to produce PHB is feasible.Overall, the feasibility of producing PHB from rapeseed biodiesel by-products has been demonstrated. The satisfactory result leads to the more important outlook that the generic feedstock derived from rapeseed biodiesel by-products has the potential to be used to produce a wide range of products depending on the micro-organism used. Further development of this process to improve nutrient production efficiency as well as product yields and subsequent integration of the process into the biodiesel production process could well be an important contribution in the development of a sustainable biodiesel industry." ],

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stage IIIB/IV or recurrent nonsquamous NSCLC (no prior systemic therapy for advanced disease) were randomly assigned 1:1 to carboplatin (area under the curve, 6 mg/ml · min) and paclitaxel (200 mg/m(2)) intravenously for up to six 3-week cycles plus either motesanib 125 mg (arm A) or placebo (arm B) once daily orally. OS was the primary end point. Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), adverse events (AEs), and association between placental growth factor (PLGF) change and OS. RESULTS: A total of 1,090 patients with nonsquamous NSCLC were randomly assigned (arms A/B, n = 541 of 549); of those, 890 had adenocarcinoma (n = 448 of 442). Median OS in arms A and B was 13.0 and 11.0 months, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.90; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.04; P = .14); median OS for the adenocarcinoma subset was 13.5 and 11.0 months, respectively (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.03; P = .11). In descriptive analyses (arms A v B), median PFS was 5.6 months versus 5.4 months (P = < .001); ORR was 40% versus 26% (P < .001). There was no association between PLGF change and OS in arm A. The incidence of grade ≥ 3 AEs (arms A and B, 73% and 59%, respectively) and grade 5 AEs (14% and 9%, respectively) was higher with motesanib treatment. CONCLUSION: Motesanib plus carboplatin/paclitaxel did not significantly improve OS over carboplatin/paclitaxel alone in patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC or in the adenocarcinoma subset." ],

  "texts" : [ "Risk perception of travelers to tropical and subtropical countries visiting a swiss travel health center", "BACKGROUND: This study assessed the risk perception ratings of travelers pre- and post-travel and in comparison to the ratings by travel health experts. While most surveys on travel health knowledge, attitudes, and practices focus on malaria and vaccine-preventable diseases, noninfectious travel risks were included in this study.\r\nMETHODS: Pre- and post-travel perception of nine travel-associated health risks was recorded among 314 travelers to tropical and subtropical destinations. All travelers sought pre-travel health advice at the Travel Clinic of the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute in 2008 and 2009. In addition, 18 Swiss travel health experts provided an assessment of the respective risks. A validated visual psychometric measuring instrument was used [pictorial representation of illness and self measure (PRISM)].\r\nRESULTS: Travelers and experts rated most risks similarly, except for accidents and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) which experts rated higher. Compared to other risks, accidents ranked highly in both groups and were the only risk perceived higher after travel. Pre- and post-travel perceptions of all other risks were similar with a tendency to be lower after travel. Travelers perceived mosquitoes to be the highest risk before travel and accidents after travel.\r\nCONCLUSION: Travelers' risk perception appears to be accurate for most risks stated in this study. However, travel health professionals should be aware that some perception patterns among travelers regarding travel-related health risks may be different from professional risk assessment. Important but insufficiently perceived health risks, such as sexual behavior/STIs and accidents, should be considered to be part of any pre-travel health advice package." ],

Such an archive will allow later writers on aspects of modern British theatre the opportunity to move ahead where past generations have had to spend time reinventing themselves as documented resources have been lacking.\r\n\r\nThe thesis documents and discusses the history and achievements of Talawa Theatre Company. Prior to this discussion the main theories, original research and methodologies used to complete this study are presented in Chapter One.\r\n\r\nThe historical aspect of the work is divided into two sections. The first section is Chapter Two and provides a historical context for Talawa's performance work. This is done by presenting a chronology of Talawa's performance roots that are shown to begin in Africa, develop in Jamaica, and end in England. The second section is Chapter Three and looks at Talawa's history between 1986 and 2001. Analysis includes discussion of definitions of black British theatre, Talawa's mission statement and the company's residency in the West End.\r\n\r\nTalawa's achievements are discussed in the body of the thesis. The notion of achievement is understood within the contemporary British theatrical context highlighting the originality of Talawa's work, and by extension the company's commitment to its mission statement. To this end aspects of Talawa's performance work are discussed thematically in the following three chapters: Chapter Four: Caribbean Plays; Chapter Five: American Plays; Chapter Six: English Plays.\r\n\r\nAlthough Talawa has also performed African plays these performances are not part of the present study. The decision to omit this genre was due to the lack of archival evidence in this area." ],

Some features common to the learning of any craft skill are discussed as well as some current ideas about the influence of networked communication on the way people relate to each other.  Conclusions are drawn about the relationships between different types of learner, different types of skill and different types of learning space which demonstrate that while there may be no substitute for face to face contact in learning the most embodied craft skills, even in real-world settings a significant proportion of learning depends on social interaction which may be reproduced online.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Keywords:</strong> <br />\nCraft learning; Apprenticeship; Communities of Practice; Online Networks</p>" ],

France is unusual in having been the first European country to establish a national theatre, and in having a plurality of national theatres. Although the Comédie-Française (est. 1680) is still regarded by many French people (not to mention foreigners) as the site of France's theatrical nationhood, it is currently one of five - or possibly seven - French national theatres. Each of them occupies a niche fashioned by the interaction of history, political agendas, and the artistic agendas of their directors.

  "texts" : [ "Testing the accuracy of machine guidance in road construction", "[Abstract]: 3D Machine Control and Guidance Systems first appeared on the market in the late 1990's. These systems put a small computer within the cab of earthwork machines that utilized Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites to relay position information to the computer. The computer evaluates the actual position relative to its location in the proposed model. The operator uses the information from the onboard computer to control the machine's equipment. In advanced cases, the onboard computer can be directly linked to the machine hydraulics, controlling their operation with minimal input from operator.\r\n\r\nAutomated machine guidance using RTS was the major new application of this advancement in technology. Robotic Total Stations (RTSs) were first introduced by Geodimeter in 1990. These instruments incorporated servomotors and advanced tracking sensors which allowed the instrument to track a target. RTS's are now utilized in the construction and extractive industries for the guidance of major earthworks machinery as well as in agriculture industry for the guidance of machinery such as tractors and harvesters.\r\n\r\nIn today's world, with the application of RTS, ATSs and now moving into real time AMG. The accuracies and latency of both operations are still not well understood, it has become critical to understand the exact accuracies that these instruments are capable of achieving whilst operating in the field. Thus upon the completion of this project my aim is to have a better understanding of both operational accuracies of several instruments, as well as their performances.\r\n\r\nThe working specification in most of road construction are general requires the tolerance of ±0.02m. In order to achieve this tolerance required for such work we need to determine if these technologies are capable of meeting such accuracies.\r\n\r\nUpon the completion of this project, we will have a better understanding of how the accuracies of the machine guidance works and under what conditions the contractor, engineers or surveyors can understand the performance of the AMG works better." ],

  "texts" : [ "Influence of access site choice on incidence of neurologic complications after percutaneous coronary intervention.", "BACKGROUND: Neurologic complications (NCs) are a rare but potentially devastating complication that may follow percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In recent years, there has been an increase in use of transradial access, driven by a developing body of evidence that favors its use over femoral access. Concerns have been raised, however, that transradial access may increase the risk of NC compared with transfemoral access. We aimed to investigate the influence of access site selection on the occurrence of NCs through a period of transition during which transradial access became the dominant route for PCI procedures performed in the United Kingdom. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society database between January 2006 and December 2010. The data were split into 2 cohorts based on access site. An NC was defined as a periprocedural ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, or transient ischemic attack occurring before hospital discharge. Binary logistic multivariate analysis was used to investigate the influence of access site utilization on NCs and adjust for measured confounding factors. RESULTS: Between 2006 and 2010, the use of radial access increased from 17.2% to 50.8% of all PCI procedures. A total of 124,616 radial procedures and 223,476 femoral procedures were studied with a NC rate of 0.11% in each cohort. In univariate (odds ratio 1.01, 95% CI 0.82-1.24, P = .93) and multivariate analysis (odds ratio 0.99, 95% CI 0.79-1.23, P = .91), there was no significant association between the use of radial access and the occurrence of NCs. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that radial access is not associated with an increased risk of clinically detected NCs, even during a period when there was a rapid evolution in the preferred access site for PCI in the United Kingdom. These are reassuring results, particularly for operators embarking on a change to radial access for PCI." ],

Despite losing the public argument, the Private Equity industry did not suffer any consequences, escaping with no significant policy changes affecting its modus operandi. Its remarkable lack of sophistication in gathering allies and dealing with politiciansand journalists alike diverges from part of the literature on business representation and its assumption that results are directly proportional to lobbying/public relations efforts, be it collectively or individually organised. The argument put forward here is that Private Equity’s victory was a consequence of its successful mobilization of existing ideological and structural conditions, leaving to the government the task of justifying any regulatory or tax changes." ],

  "title" : "The Embeddedness of Ethical Banking in the UK",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "The Embeddedness of Ethical Banking in the UK", "AbstractUniversity of ManchesterDaniel Tischer, PhDThe Embeddedness of Ethical Banking in the UK2012Following the financial crisis that began in 2007, various groups and individuals demanded an ecologically diverse banking sector to help spread risk in the banking industry and to more effectively cater to customer needs. To date, however, measures to change retail banking have been limited to modest structural and incentive adjustments to boost competition and modify the banking culture which prompts an investigation about the nature of the ethical banking sector and its ability to grow and thrive. The lack of progress in reforming banking in the UK raises questions of whether and how we could encourage and sustain ethical, social and non-profit alternatives to current high street banks. Because prior academic research in ethical has been limited, the research aims to fill gaps with regards to understanding the network established between ethical banks their business models and to identify the type of intervention needed to promote ethical banking as an alternative to established mainstream retail banking.The research presented in this thesis investigates how the ethical banking sector is embedded in the UK financial services industry and draws out political-economic dynamics that facilitate as well as hinder the development of the sector. To this end, the thesis develops a conceptual framework that draws on literatures on industrial districts and embeddedness. The thesis also models and analyses the ethical banking network using social network analysis, before developing an understanding of ethical banks’ business models and how the sector is organised within the banking industry. Data on the banks’ relationships with other organisations were gathered through questionnaires, and interviews were conducted with respondent firms to explore ethical banking as a sector from the perspective of ethical banks themselves. In addition, company, industry and legislative publications have been analysed to add context and validate findings.At the broadest level, the results draw a picture of ethical banking as a diverse but disorganised subsector which is dominated by two players and lacks prospects to develop into an alternative banking sector that could compete with the full banking services offered by high street competition. Only if the sector manages to reorganise itself internally with support from external players could it form a more coherent and centralised subsector with a clear and shared understanding as to what its ambitions are. Thus the research highlights the potential of ethical banking which is expanding rapidly, but, at the same time, the research also raises the difficulties in developing ethical banking as a sector which retains its distinctiveness   from high street banks. In sum, the research findings are in line with current ambitions to develop and promote a more diverse and sustainable UK banking industry: ethical banks should receive more attention from policy makers as they are a set of diverse actors that has grown significantly since the beginning of the financial crisis and, could if strengthened, contribute to developing a stronger retail banking sector more responsive to customer needs. Government efforts to reorganise banking should include developing ethical banking as an alternative to Plc retail banks which would change competition by increasing consumer choice instead of creating yet more large scale banks." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Student as researchers: student leadership of school ICT policymaking", "While the body of research on student voice focusing mainly on the rights of students as espoused in the UN (1989) Convention on the Rights of the Child has grown, little work has been done on the relationship between students and leadership (Mitra and Gross, 2009). The impetus for this study are arguments of Smyth (2006), which suggest that it is time for schools to move away from old regimes to a different kind of educational leadership that encourages authentic forms of student participation. He proposes ‘learner-centred policy generation’ as a more inclusive, more democratic way of generating school policies.   Such arguments are akin to Luckin’s (2008) plea for the development of learner-generated contexts in educational technology, which she argues is a ‘more democratic learning economy ... where the balance between learner and teacher or mentor control is constantly changing’ (p 461). Her arguments hinge on the fact that we are now faced with the situation in schools where many students know more than their teachers about digital learning tools. Democracy itself has been described as fragile (Osler and Starkey, 2006 p 433) partly because there is much variation in its scope, and in its interpretation, and also because democratic practice needs continual validation if it is to be successful. But undoubtedly the essence of democracy is the exposure of different perspectives, which makes it worth aspiring for in the school setting.In this presentation I report on a study that examines the extent to which an ethos of shared planning and decision-making might be developed through student leadership, to improve learning with ICT at an independent secondary school in England. 25 students (referred to as student researchers) aged between 14 and 19 at the school participate in an action research project to develop policy recommendations on how to improve teaching and learning with ICT, which they present to the school’s senior management team. I give an account of the process of organising these students as researchers and on some of the consequences of their involvement. Methodology, Methods, Research Instruments or Sources UsedThe student researchers were volunteers from three sections of my computer applications course. During 2009–2010 they designed questionnaires used to survey teachers and students at the school. Using action research methodology they met regularly with the High School Technology Consortium—a group consisting of administrators, teachers and student council representatives—to reflect on the data collected. There were four cycles in the action research project, during which they gathered and discussed the opinions of students and teachers at the school, and the ICT practices at other international schools. The consortium, which served as ‘critical friends’, worked with the student researchers to develop the policy recommendations. As a researching professional, I conducted a case study of the action research project in order to gather a range of perceptions about involving students in school ICT policymaking, and to understand the willingness of students and staff at the school to work together to improve ICT for the beneficiaries. Data collection for took place between 2009 and 2012. Three rounds of semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants of the project. In addition, observations conducted during meetings and relevant documents, including media coverage, internal publications and pages from group and school websites, were analysed. Conclusions, Expected Outcomes or FindingsInitial findings indicate that (a) students have a desire to play a leading role in ICT for learning, (b) teachers and administrators are willing to share power with them in the process of developing school ICT policy, and (c) there is need for an atmosphere of shared planning and decision-making about teaching and learning with ICT in school. It is suggested that this project also has implications for the ways in which educational professionals understand and work to include students as active citizens within the school community.

  "texts" : [ "Travelling with austerity - impacts of cuts on Travellers, Traveller projects and services", "Executive summary and key challenges\r\nThis report follows the evolution of community development work with the Traveller\r\ncommunity from the 1980s to the present day; examines the effect of austerity on the\r\nTraveller community in general and the community development work therein\r\nspecifically; and looks at how community development work with Travellers may best\r\nbe developed in the future. Four pen portraits of Traveller advocates are included.\r\nThe period from the breaking of the economic and social crisis in 2008 has seen a\r\ndramatic disinvestment by the state in the Traveller community. Using the\r\ngovernment’s own figures, it is possible to identify the scale of the austerity cuts, as\r\nfollows, but they should be compared to the overall reduction in government current\r\nspending of -4.3% over 2008-2013, the baseline.\r\nProgrammes for Travellers\r\nInteragency activities -100%\r\nTraveller education -86.6%\r\nTraveller accommodation -85%\r\nEquality -76.3%\r\nNational Traveller organisations -63.6%\r\nFAS Special Initiative for Travellers -50%\r\nNational Traveller Partnership -32.1%\r\nTraveller SPY youth projects -29.8%\r\nHealth1 -5.4%\r\nProgrammes and funding lines of importance to Travellers\r\nEquality and rights agencies -69%\r\nLocal & Community Development Programme -42.3%\r\nInitiatives against drugs -32.5%\r\nOne of the most striking aspects of these cuts was that statutory agencies did not even\r\nspend all their allocations, so the picture is even more difficult. This is a table of the\r\nproportions actually spent (and, conversely, the underspend):\r\nSpend Underspend\r\nHealth 82% 18%\r\nEquality 72% 28%\r\nAccommodation 64% 36%\r\nFAS Special Initiative for Travellers 60% 40%\r\nThe only exceptions to the pattern of cuts were the Traveller social economy\r\nprogramme and the National Traveller Money Advice and Budgeting Service,\r\nwhich show that it is possible to protect or even increase specific budget lines.These figures tell an egregious story of an extraordinary level of disinvestment by the\r\nIrish state in the Traveller community. One can think of no other section of the\r\ncommunity which has suffered such a high level of withdrawal of funding and human\r\nresources, compounded by the failure of the state to spend even the limited resources\r\nthat it has made available.\r\nThe reductions in accommodation and education are especially impactful, granted the\r\ncontinued hardship faced by many Travellers on sites and in poor quality private rented accommodation, and granted the still-wide gap in educational opportunities\r\nbetween the Traveller and the settled community. Worrying reports are already\r\ncoming through on the negative consequences for Travellers at school.\r\nIn looking to the future, the report lays out the challenges for community development\r\nfor the next years with Travellers.\r\nThese are:\r\nThe need to protect, preserve and extend the gains made by community\r\ndevelopment over the past thirty years, principally its model of development, the\r\ninfrastructure of Traveller organisations that has built up and the leadership that\r\nhas developed, training a new, younger generation that will enable the community\r\nto cope with the hardships inflicted by austerity, respond to them and emerge from\r\nthem;\r\nThe need to challenge and reverse the effects of the decisions taken, which have\r\ndisproportionately affected the Traveller community, challenging those areas from\r\nwhere the state has retreated, such as anti – racism and inter - culturalism and the\r\nprevention of discrimination. The state continues to take decisions without\r\nconsulting Travelling people, with Travellers unrepresented on high-level groups\r\nat national level and local level, contrary to European principles.\r\nThe importance of making the strategies and the structures developed over the past\r\ndecades work effectively, especially in such areas as health, accommodation,\r\neducation, the labour market and enterprise;\r\nThe need to address key political issues, notably recognition of the Traveller\r\ncommunity as a minority ethnic group; amendment of the equal status legislation\r\nso as to make it a truly effective instrument against discrimination;\r\ninterculturalism, especially in schools which are slow to address issues of culture\r\nand discrimination despite examples of some good initiatives; and the alignment\r\nprocess, which must preserve the independence of community development\r\nprojects working with Travellers." ],

  "title" : "Analysis and Research of VOCS in Industrial Wastewater in High-tech",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Analysis and Research of VOCS in Industrial Wastewater in High-tech", "[[abstract]]In recent years, the domestic industrial form has changed into the high-tech industry gradually and many science parks are flourishing. But pollution problems come with these developments so that pollution problems brought by the high-tech industry have become the great task of the environment conservation. The organic solvents used by the high-tech industry are various and complex and they are usually not used by the traditional industry because the process of the high-tech industry changes quickly and the new process is of business confidentiality. Therefore, the ingredient of most organic solvents even cannot be identified clearly and many organic solvents even cannot be transpired by common inspection means.\nThis research takes a certain science park as the background. At the beginning of this research, study the status of organic raw materials used at present in this science park by selecting correlative information offered before setting up factories, including setup of the fixed pollution source, operation license, approval for the proposal of measures for water pollution prevention and cure, waste treatment proposal, pollution prevention proposal, etc. Then, probe into the organic raw materials by studying categories and total volume of waste organic solvents discharged in this science park during the next period, and find out the possible VOCs sources in the science park by selecting the information about categories and total volume of waste organic solvents discharged. And control VOCs efficiently in the future based on this information.\nFurthermore, take samples of waste water and air in the sewage treatment plant and in floss holes, correlative sewer intakes of seven factories whose total volume of waste water discharged is greater in the science park. Then, analyse the ingredient and the consistency of the volatile organic substance in the waste water and the air to find out how many categories of volatile organic substances in the sewage discharged by the high-tech industry and to find out the probable position and the probable volume of the volatile organic substance in the course of discharging from factories to the sewage treatment plant and to the environment. And the result of the research is expected to be the reference for the correlative administration departments to control volatile organic substances. There are 2 stages in the water and air sampling and the analysis in the science park. The analysis methods for samples of water and air in the study as follows: the inspection method for volatile organic substances in the water---NIEA W785.53B; the inspection method for volatile organic substances in the air---NIEA A715.11B.\nAfter investigating organic raw materials used by factories, we found that organic raw materials used frequently by factories at present include the developing solution (mixed solvent of organic substances with Ammonia), wet spinner (mixed solvent of organic substances with Propylene Glycol Methyl Ether), striper, Silane, N-NMP, isopropanol, DMSO-Dimethyl Sulfoxide, Carbon Tetrafluoride…etc. We studied more than 3,400 tons of organic raw materials used by factories in this science park per month. But when we studied the information about categories and volume of organic solvents discharged, we found that the information about waste organic substances we could select was very limited. And by studying the information available, we found that nearly all the organic solvents used by factories were reclaimed. Therefore, we still cannot find out the source of VOCs in the science park through the primary results of studying categories and volume of organic solvents discharged.\nThe result on the first stage shows that there are 8 volatile organic substances in water samples as follows: Dichlorodifluoromethane, Dichloromethane, Benzene, Toluene, Ethyl benzene, m & p–Xylene, o–Xylene and 1, 2, 4–Trichlorobenzne. And there are 10 volatile organic substances in air samples as follows: Acetone, 2-Butanone, Dichlorodifluoromethane, Dichloromethane, Benzene, Toluene, Ethyl benzene, m & p–Xylene, o–Xylene and 1, 2, 4–Trichlorobenzne. On the second stage, we analyzed the substances mentioned above and the result shows that the relations between the high-tech industry and the volatile organic substance are: factories of integrate circuit produce Dichlorodifluoromethane, m & p–Xylene and o–Xylene; factories of photoelectric industry produce Benzene, Toluene, Ethyl benzene, m & p–Xylene, o–Xylene and 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene; factories of biotechnology produce Benzene, Toluene, Ethyl benzene and 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene.\nThe consistency of volatile organic substances mentioned above in samples of water and air is so low that it is much lower than the threshold of human olfaction. But most volatile organic substances existing in the water volatilize during the discharge, and the most obvious volatilization exists in sewage balance tanks and biological aeration tanks in the sewage treatment plant.\nAt present, we haven’t established a perfect management and control system for volatile organic substances in the science park yet. Although volatile organic substances will put direct influences on human health and sense, volatile organic substances inspected by our analysis methods don’t exceed the threshold of human according to the results of the study at present, and their influences on the science park are very limited. And because organic materials used by factories in the science park are different from that used by the traditional industry, we still need to use other inspection methods, such as OP-FTIR, TO-14, to find out whether there are other organic substances that cannot be identified by our analysis methods. And we suggest that administration department establish an improved management and control system for organic solvents from source to discharge and to reclaim." ],

  "texts" : [ "Do Credit Market Shocks Affect the Real Economy? Quasi-Experimental Evidence from the Great Recession and 'Normal' Economic Times", "We estimate the effect of the sharp reduction in credit supply following the 2008 financial crisis on the real economy. The identification strategy relies on the substantial heterogeneity in the degree to which banks cut lending over this period. Specifically, we predict changes in county-level small business lending over 2007-2009 by estimating the national change in each bank’s lending that is attributable to supply factors (e.g., due to differences in the crisis' effect on their balance sheets) and, subsequently, allocating this quantity to counties based on the banks' pre-crisis market shares. We find that in 2008, 2009, and 2010, this measure is highly predictive of total county-level small business loan originations indicating that, at least in the near term, a firm cannot easily find a new lender if its bank limits access to credit. Additionally, we find that areas with more exposure to banks that cut small business lending during this period experience depressed employment and business formation. Upper bound estimates suggest that the 2007-2009 decline in small business lending accounted for up to 20% of the decline in employment in firms with less than 20 employees, 16% of the total employment loss, and 30% of the decline in inflation adjusted aggregate wages during this period. Finally, we note that the relationship between lending supply and economic activity is not evident in the 1997-2007 period, underscoring the unique circumstances during the Great Recession." ],

According to John Swinton, the realm of the spirit is that characteristically human, dynamic life-force which vitalises and invigorates a person and motivates him/her to seek God, values, meaning, purpose and hope. \n\nThis dissertation makes holistic spirituality the object of its study, drawing attention to the connections by which the realm of the spirit is joined to other fundamental activities and dimensions of human life. These include 1) thinking 2) deeds and practical action 3) relationships and interactive networks 4) feelings and attitudes influencing behaviour 5) the dimensions of existence and being. It is in the realm of the spirit, in other words inwardly, as spiritual issues, that the meaning, value and significance of experiences are perceived. \n\nThe primary sources of this study comprise six books from 1892   1905, products of the later years of Ellen White, an American who lived 1827   1915, and systematic analysis is employed as the method of study. A practical, down-to-earth touch is essential to White s way of discussing religious praxis. This study shows that the views of Martin Luther have had a significant influence on White s thinking. The sources reveal a similarity between her views and the lines of thought in his literary production highlighted by some of the most recent Finnish studies of Luther. Although White and Luther represent different levels of theological learning, both have a similar view of the essence of the relation between God and humankind: God s love and activity flowing from his grace lie at its basis. Secondly, the existential connection,  union  between a person and Christ is the foundation for God s acceptance of and care for him/her now and forever. Thirdly, this alliance and joining of Christ and the person is manifested as cooperation and companionship aimed at realising common goals in the world. White emphasises the interactive and active nature of the spiritual relationship between the person and Christ, which is expressed in unselfishness, consideration for other people and their needs, and in compassion and an ability to place oneself in the position of another. \n\nWhite connects her thoughts on a healthful lifestyle and education to a broad understanding of spirituality which aims for the person s holistic welfare. She does not see spirituality as insular, cut off from the day-to-day business of life, but rather as the primary dimension which energises, gives purpose and guides a person in all aspects of life. \n\nDuring the course of the study the concepts  surrender to God  and  character , frequently used by White, became a focus of attention. According to White, a person cannot reach God alone, by an effort of the will; instead, when faced with God s loving invitation, one must cease to will for oneself and agree to unite with God s will and purpose. This is connected to the internal change which White describes by the concept of character. The new orientation of the will, accomplished by God s grace, changes the person s being, values, attitudes and ability for sympathetic interaction to such an extent that the person is no longer quite the same as before. There is, on the one hand, a sudden and total change of being, but at the same time a quiet, life-long growth and development are intended. It is through the concept of character that White describes spirituality and the inner journey it entails. \n\nThis study approaches spirituality as a universal human characteristic and quality, which means that the primary focus is not on individual doctrinal views or forms of religious practice. The purpose here is to outline a unifying structure within which holistic spirituality can be more clearly perceived and be understood in more detail." ],

  "texts" : [ "Close relation of fasting insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) with glucose tolerance and cardiovascular risk in two populations.", "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Insulin resistance/hyperinsulinaemia is implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease and diabetes but its role and causal pathways are not clear. We tested the hypothesis that the insulin-like growth factor system is independently associated with cardiovascular risk within susceptible populations based on previous reports of the links between low circulating insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 concentrations and increased macrovascular disease in Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. METHODS: In a population-based study 272 subjects (142 subjects of European and 130 Pakistani of origin) underwent a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test and standardised anthropometry. Fasting concentrations of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II), intact insulin and lipids were measured and were related to 2-h glucose tolerance test status. Insulin sensitivity was calculated using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). RESULTS: Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 was significantly lower in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance when compared with normal glucose tolerance in both ethnic groups (Europeans F = 6.7, p = 0.002 and Pakistanis F = 4.4, p = 0.01). Multiple linear regression modelling showed that insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 was independently associated with 2-h glucose (beta = 0.16, p = 0.009) and logistic regression indicated a 40% reduction in risk of impaired glucose tolerance for every 2.7 ng/ml increase in the insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 concentration [odds ratio 0.6 (CI = 0.49-0.71), p = 0.001)]. In addition, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 was significantly correlated negatively with several established cardiovascular factors, and positively with insulin sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 is closely related to risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease in people of European and Pakistani origin. It has potential use as a marker of (hepatic) insulin resistance in clinical intervention studies and further implicates the insulin-like growth factor system in the development of macrovascular disease." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "The roles of microstructure and mechanics in intergranular stress corrosion cracking", "Previous work on the prediction of intergranular stress corrosion cracking resistance in grain boundary engineered microstructures has used two dimensional percolation models, in which the grain boundaries are assumed to be either resistant or susceptible to cracking, depending on the grain boundary character. One limitation of such models is that they do not necessarily account for the mechanical crack driving force. Further, they cannot capture experimentally observed phenomena such as the formation of isolated ductile bridging ligaments by resistant boundaries. These arise due to the three-dimensional character of crack propagation. A new mechanical crack propagation model is presented which, via finite element solutions, addresses these limitations. The model is based on a regular discrete representation of the material's microstructure and is applicable to both 2D and 3D behaviour. Results are reported for 2D-hexagonal microstructures, and are compared with percolation models. The results demonstrate the influence of stress on the crack path, as well as the influence of the rupture strain of susceptible boundaries on the crack behaviour. Further, the effect of crack bridging, which arises from ductile resistant boundaries is studied." ],

A social worker is employed by the school to join the student support services. A new method of brief intervention is introduced by the social worker based on 'aspirations, encouragement, realism and openness' (AERO), summarised by one teacher as helping a conversation develop in which the young people can discuss problems that they would otherwise find difficult. All of this is established with no special pilot project status or resources.<p></p>This article considers the relationship between these factors and evaluates the impact of the AERO method through interviews with key participants — 12 students currently in school and one parent, all of whom had direct experience of the method, and six professionals who experienced the impact of the model. The findings suggest that the philosophy of social inclusion introduced by a new head teacher is sustained by a systematic approach to providing social and personal support to students, and by the use of an effective and efficient practice method. The article discusses the possibilities of transferring the lessons from this study and also the possible limitations of the social work method and the study itself." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "The UK Bank Corporate Governance Framework: A Holistic and Critical Analysis with a Focus upon Bank Risk and Executive Remuneration Governance", "This thesis is the first piece of legal academic research that takes a holistic approach to the bank corporate governance framework in the UK, with a critical analysis of each key component of the governance framework. Its research questions are twofold: what are the key problems of the UK bank governance framework and how to improve it? Although “black letter” law analysis is at the core of the methodological approach of this thesis, the analysis draws extensively upon the bank-governance-related findings of the literature of economics, finance, management, accounting and psychology. Moreover, modest use of historical and empirical analytical tools is attempted. This thesis comprises five chapters. Chapter One (the adapted principal-agent theory and bank governance, a historical account of UK bank corporate governance, and the FSA’s regulatory system in respect of bank corporate governance) and Chapter Two (an experimental empirical study on enforcement mechanisms in UK bank corporate governance) set the general backdrop, against which the UK framework for bank executive remuneration governance (Chapter Three) and the UK framework for bank risk governance (Chapter Four) are holistically discussed and critically analysed. Chapter Five makes the following conclusions: (1) This thesis, based on Professor Heremans’ work, redefines agency problems in banks with dispersed shareholders to comprise two-tier agency problems and the agency problems between the regulator and the regulated. This theoretical framework has been extensively used in the analysis of this thesis.(2) None of the distinct but interlinked governance mechanisms of the UK bank governance framework are a panacea and risk-free. Each governance mechanism is beset by its own obstacles and limits, hence no single governance mechanism can function effectively alone. The UK bank governance framework should fully recognise the limitations of each governance mechanism and eradicate any false sense of confidence. It would be inaccurate to describe them as substitutes for each other. (3) Agency problems affect the effectiveness of and the interaction between governance mechanisms. Equity governance mechanisms in the form of self-regulation cannot address debt governance problems and financial stability concerns alone without regulatory intervention. Further, some of the equity governance mechanisms may have a negative impact upon debt governance. The thesis thus concludes that various governance mechanisms must all work together efficiently and consistently if a UK bank’s governance matrix is to be robust and the objectives of a proper UK bank governance framework are to be met.(4) The effectiveness of the framework, in particular from the perspective of risk governance and executive remuneration governance, calls for a number of factors to be observed.(5) An inherent limitation of the UK bank governance framework is that it is not, and cannot be, designed to address possible black swan phenomena. The framework should be, and is, to a large extent, designed to effectively discourage and prevent bank boards and senior management from building exposures to or, continuing with, known ill-considered or inadequately controlled risk and to effectively encourage them to incorporate foreseeable systemic risk into their bank’s risk appetite/risk tolerance." ],

Quantitative analysis and simulation of a computational model of the intrinsic BG demonstrated that its output was consistent with this proposition. Here we build on that model by embedding it into a wider circuit containing the motor thalamocortical loop and thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). Simulation of this extended model showed that the additions gave five main results which are desirable in a selection/switching mechanism. First, low salience actions (i.e. those with low urgency) could be selected. Second, the range of salience values over which actions could be switched between was increased. Third, the contrast between the selected and non-selected actions was enhanced via improved differentiation of outputs from the BG. Fourth, transient increases in the salience of a non-selected action were prevented from interrupting the ongoing action, unless the transient was of sufficient magnitude. Finally, the selection of the ongoing action persisted when a new closely matched salience action became active. The first result was facilitated by the thalamocortical loop; the rest were dependent on the presence of the TRN. Thus, we conclude that the results are consistent with these structures having clearly defined functions in action selection." ],

Probiotic bacteria are known to inhibit the growth of pathogenic microbes. We tested the hypothesis that cheese containing probiotic bacteria can reduce the prevalence of oral Candida. During this 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 276 elderly people consumed daily 50 g of either probiotic (n = 136) or control cheese (n = 140). The primary outcome measure was the prevalence of a high salivary yeast count (>or= 10(4) cfu/mL) analyzed by the Dentocult method. The prevalence decreased in the probiotic group from 30% to 21% (32% reduction), and increased in the control group from 28% to 34%. Probiotic intervention reduced the risk of high yeast counts by 75% (OR = 0.25, 95%CI 0.10-0.65, p = 0.004), and the risk of hyposalivation by 56% (OR = 0.44, 95%CI 0.19-1.01, p = 0.05).

  "texts" : [ "An Analysis of the Role of Civil Society in Building Peace in Ethno-religious Conflict: A Case Study of the Three Southernmost Provinces of Thailand", "The ‘Southern Fire’ is an ethno-religious conflict in the southernmost region of Thailand that has claimed thousands of innocent lives since an upsurge in violence in 2004. Although it does not catch the world’s attention as much as other conflict cases in the same region, daily violent incidents are ongoing for more than a decade. The violence in the south has multiple causes including historical concerns, economic marginalisation, political and social issues, religious and cultural differences, educational opportunity inequities, and judicial discrimination. \r\nAccording to a framework for conflict resolution, for Thailand’s case, the state’s policy alone could not resolve the conflict as it focused mainly on implementing a ‘peacekeeping’ strategy by increasing the number of security forces and pursuing a ‘peacemaking’ strategy via peace talks. However, to create lasting peace in this region, civil society actors need to be involved in a ‘peacebuilding’ strategy in order to keep the balance of socio-economic structures and prevent violence from happening again. More than a hundred civil society groups are involved in attempting to build peace in the southernmost provinces. Since the resurgence of violence, some civil society groups have accumulated their experiences and played significant roles in the area. These groups have become a strong network which could reduce the tensions in this region. \r\nThe research aims to promote the civil society sector as a tool of a non-violent approach; to study the role of the civil society sector in building peace in the southernmost provinces; and to strengthen civil society groups attempting to find a solution to the insurgent problem. This research used the qualitative method employing in-depth interviews and documentary research. The data was collected through person-to-person interviews with representatives of twenty-nine civil society groups. This research examines the role of the civil society sector in building peace in southern region; the efficacy of civil society groups; the problems of civil society groups active in the south; and puts forward recommendations on how to improve the work of the civil society groups.\r\nOne of the main findings was that bridge-builder, academic and relief worker are the most significant roles civil society groups play. The efficacy of the civil society sector in peacebuilding in the deep south shows that it has the potential to grow. It has a number of strong internal factors and many external opportunities that can increase capabilities and help the groups to perform better. There are, however, four important problems including human resources, time management, influence from funding sources, and political and safety issues, which can have a serious impact on the civil society sector. The three key recommendations that can help to enhance the performance of civil society groups are building trust in the communities, understanding the needs of the locals, and working with a clear strategy.\r\nThis research concludes that the civil society sector plays various roles in attempting to create peace in this region. Together with other actors, the civil society sector can be an important part of the effort to reduce the violence and can play a major role in building sustainable peace in southern Thailand when the violence eventually stops" ],

DESIGN AND METHOD: The WHOQOL-SRPB assesses QoL relating to SRPB where 33 QoL facets are scored in 6 domains, of which SRPB is one. The measure was completed by a heterogeneous sample of 285 sick and well people representing a cross-section of religious, agnostic, and atheist beliefs in UK, and structured for gender (52% female) and age (mean 47 years). RESULTS: No evidence was found to support the model of spiritual QoL as a concept that overarches every other QoL domain. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that SRPB is an integral concept to overall QoL, with a very good fit (comparative fit index=.99). Spiritual QoL made a significant, relatively independent contribution, similar to the other five domains (β=0.68). Spiritual QoL is most closely associated with the psychological domain, particularly hope and optimism and inner peace; two of the nine SRPB facets. Spiritual QoL, but not most other aspects of QoL, is higher for religious people. CONCLUSION: The results explain theoretical confusion arising from previous research. Spiritual QoL makes a significant and distinctive contribution to QoL assessment in health and should be assessed routinely in health care populations." ],

METHODS: This Phase I study investigated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of vandetanib when administered with either gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) or vinorelbine plus cisplatin (VC) in patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. RESULTS: Seventeen patients received vandetanib 100 mg/d plus VC (n = 9) or GC (n = 8). Three dose-limiting toxicities were reported in each treatment group: vandetanib + VC (pulmonary artery thrombosis and asymptomatic QTc prolongation [n = 2]); vandetanib + GC (peripheral ischemia [due to arterial occlusion], pulmonary embolism, and limb venous thrombosis). The protocol definition of a tolerable dose was not met, and no patients were recruited to receive vandetanib 300 mg plus VC or GC. There was no apparent pharmacokinetic interaction between vandetanib and vinorelbine or gemcitabine, but there was an approximate 30% increase in the exposure to cisplatin, which may be due to accumulation of total platinum and/or an interaction with vandetanib. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, in patients with previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer, vandetanib 100 mg/d in combination with either VC or GC was not tolerated." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Three Essays in Chinese Accounting", "In this thesis, I examine financial reporting issues in the Chinese context, with a particular focus on the effect of political forces. The thesis consists of three essays.In the first essay, I examine whether the earnings properties and share price anticipation of earnings of Chinese firms changed following the mandatory adoption of Chinese IFRS in 2007. Using a set of IFRS “early adopters” as a control group, I find that the earnings persistence and other measures of earnings properties, among the treatment group of firms adopting Chinese IFRS in 2007, do not change significantly. However, I do find that share price anticipation of earnings improves for the treatment group relative to the control group, consistent with the improved transparency associated with Chinese IFRS adoption making it easier for investors to forecast future earnings. Particularly, I find that the improvement in the share price anticipation of earnings is confined to firms that are not state controlled or subsidized, and so largely rely on capital markets to supply most of their financial needs.In the second essay, I examine the value relevance of government subsidies for Chinese listed companies. My exploration of the valuation consequences of state support is structured around three questions. First, are the government subsidies received by Chinese listed companies value relevant? Second, does the value relevance of government subsidies depend on the purpose for which the subsidies are used? Third, does the value relevance of government subsidies depend on the channel through which the subsidies are granted? I motivate these research questions through interviews of accountants, managers, academics and government officials. Through large sample analyses, I confirm that subsidies are positively related to firm value, but less so for distressed firms and subsidies granted through non-tax channels. My study contributes to the understanding of a Chinese-style capitalism that is driving China towards becoming the largest economy in the World.In the third and final essay, I examine whether state subsidies influence the voluntary corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosures of Chinese listed firms. Focusing on Chinese manufacturing industries for the period 2006-2009, I find that a well established model of CSR disclosures that was designed for Western companies produces similar results in China. I then go on to exploit the additional unique institutional features of China that have material implications for disclosure choice over and above the variables that commonly figure in Western models. In particular, I focus on the influence of state subsidies on the CSR disclosure choices of Chinese firms, taking care to distinguish between state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and non-state owned enterprises (NSOEs). I find that state subsidies do (do not) significantly affect the CSR disclosure choices of NSOEs (SOEs). I also find a significant difference between the influence of tax-based subsidies and non-tax based subsidies on NSOEs. My findings are consistent with the political cost hypothesis that firms receiving state subsidies, especially those not under state control, are pressured to disclose CSR activities due to political cost concerns associated with public demand as well as government scrutiny." ],

OUTCOMES: Dentofacial changes were assessed from lateral cephalograms and occlusal changes using the peer assessment rating (PAR). Self-esteem was assessed using the Piers-Harris children's self-concept scale, and the psychosocial impact of malocclusion with oral aesthetic subjective impact score (OASIS) questionnaire. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) signs and symptoms were also recorded. The time points for data collection were at registration (DC1), 15 months later (DC2) and 3 years post-registration (DC3). RESULTS: The following mean skeletal and occlusal changes occurred from the class III starting point to DC3 (3-year follow-up): SNA, PFG moved forwards +2·3° (CG forward +1·6°; P = 0·14); SNB, PFG moved forwards +0·8° (CG forward +1·5°, P = 0·26); ANB, PFG class III base improved +1·5° (CG stayed about the same at +0·1°; P = 0·001). This contributed to an overall difference in ANB between PFG and CG of +1·4° in favour of early protraction facemask treatment. The overjet was still improved by +3·6 mm in the PFG and changed a small amount +1·1 mm in the CG (P = 0·001). A 21% improvement in PAR was shown in the PFG and the CG worsened by 8·4% (P = 0·02). There was no increase in self-esteem (Piers-Harris score) for PFG compared with the CG (P = 0·56) and no statistically significant difference in the impact of malocclusion (OASIS) between groups in terms of the changes from DC1 to DC3 (P = 0·18). TMJ signs and symptoms were very low at DC1 and DC3. CONCLUSIONS: The favourable effect of early class III protraction facemask treatment undertaken in patients under 10 years of age, is maintained at 3-year follow-up in terms of ANB, overjet and % PAR improvement. The direct protraction treatment effect at SNA is still favourable although not statistically significantly better than the CG. Seventy per cent of patients in PFG had maintained a positive overjet which we have defined as ongoing treatment success. Early protraction facemask treatment does not seem to influence self-esteem or reduce the patient's personal impact of their malocclusion at 3-year follow-up." ],

  "texts" : [ "Dynamic link-based ranking over large-scale graph- structured data", "Information Retrieval techniques have been the primary means of keyword search in document collections. However, as the amount and the diversity of available semantic connections between objects increase, link-based ranking methods including ObjectRank have been proposed to provide high-recall semantic keyword search over graph-structured data. Since a wide variety of data sources can be modeled as data graphs, supporting keyword search over graph- structured data greatly improves the usability of such data sources. However, it is challenging in both online performance and result quality. We first address the performance issue of dynamic authority-based ranking methods such as personalized PageRank and ObjectRank. Since they dynamically rank nodes in a data graph using an expensive matrix-multiplication method, the online execution time rapidly increases as the size of data graph grows. Over the English Wikipedia dataset of 2007, ObjectRank spends 20-40 seconds to compute query-specific relevance scores, which is unacceptable. We introduce a novel approach, BinRank, that approximates dynamic link- based ranking scores efficiently. BinRank partitions a dictionary into bins of relevant keywords and then constructs materialized subgraphs(MSGs) per bin in preprocessing stage. In query time, to produce highly accurate top-K results efficiently, BinRank uses the MSG corresponding to the given keyword, instead of the original data graph. PageRank and ObjectRank calculate the global importance score and the query-specific authority score of each node respectively by exploiting the link structure of a given data graph. However, both measures favor nodes with high in-degree that may contain popular yet generic content, and thus those nodes are frequently included in top-K lists, regardless of given query. We propose a novel ranking measure, Inverse ObjectRank, which measures the content-specificity of each node by traversing the semantic links in the data graph in the reverse direction. Then, we allow users to adjust the importance of the three ranking measures (global importance, query-relevance, and content-specificity) to improve the quality of search results" ],

  "texts" : [ "“Real” Native Speakers: Visible ethnic minority, native English speaking teachers", "In the professional world of TESOL, the native English speaker (NES) / non-native English speaker (NNES) dichotomy is a firmly entrenched hierarchy that affects how teachers are perceived and valued. Within the international English language education business, the NES status is often associated with a particular racial profile.  The view that NES are preferred English language teachers remains the dominant storyline, which is made available to those that fit the racial and linguistic criteria. As a NES of Filipino ethnic origins, I am visibly not part of this profile and, as I have experienced, visible ethnic minorities can find that their NES identity is not acknowledged by students, school managers and even NNESTs. In this multi-stage, narrative based study I further problematize the NES preference by examining the experiences of visible ethnic minorities who are native English speaking teachers (VEM-NESTs). Moreover I am both the researcher and a participant and I have deliberately incorporated my story as part of the methodological design.  The stories generated in response to my narrative have been influenced by my identity as a VEM-NEST in addition to the content of my story.  This paper presents how VEM-NESTs have subverted the dominant NES storyline and through this subversive stance, reconstructs their racial and linguistic identity in response to the resistance they encountered when striving to be recognized as a ‘legitimate’ English language professional. The findings have implications on the criteria currently used for evaluating the worth of English language teachers, NES and NNES." ],

The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic potential of a 5-HT3 antagonist in irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: Fifty patients with irritable bowel syndrome were treated with ondansetron, a highly selective 5-HT3 antagonist, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study. In addition to assessing its effect on the classical symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (abdominal pain, distension and disordered bowel habit) its effect on symptoms often seen in irritable bowel syndrome, but more commonly associated with functional dyspepsia, was also examined. RESULTS: Ondansetron reduced bowel frequency (P = 0.035) and improved stool consistency (P = 0.002) in diarrhoea predominant irritable bowel syndrome and did not cause a deterioration of bowel habit in constipation predominant subjects. No statistically significant improvement was seen for abdominal pain or distension, although those patients who did respond were approximately twice as likely to be taking ondansetron than placebo. It was also found that ondansetron significantly improved the upper gastrointestinal symptoms of post-prandial epigastric discomfort (P = 0.008), flatulence (P = 0.022) and heartburn (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The results of this study justify evaluation of the therapeutic potential of selective 5-HT antagonists in both functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome." ],

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine the effects of isotretinoin on quality of life(QoL) and depression using a prospective design. METHODS: The WHOQOL-BREF QoL measure and Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale were administered to consecutive outpatients with acne who were prescribed either isotretinoin (n = 65) or antibiotic treatment (n = 31).Patients and physicians rated acne severity independently. Groups were compared at baseline with a matched community sample (n = 94) and measurements repeated at 3 months for treatment groups. RESULTS: There were no differences between the three groups at baseline in terms of age, gender, depression or overall QoL. Acne was more severe in the treatment groups (P < 0·001). Depression was negatively correlated with QoL (P < 0·001)and hence was included as a covariate in repeated-measures analyses of QoL.Acne improved over time in both treatment groups (F = 48·2, P < 0·001). There was no detectable deterioration in depression score in either group (F = 1·1, not significant). QoL in the physical and social domains improved (P < 0·001) while psychological and environmental QoL was unchanged over time. The improvement in social QoL was greater in the isotretinoin group (P < 0·05). Those patients with higher baseline depression scores showed greater improvements in physical, psychological and social QoL (P < 0·001). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of acne improves QoL, particularly in those with more depressive symptoms at the outset. Mood deterioration was not detected, but the possibility of subtle or rare mood effects of isotretinoin cannot be ruled out." ],

In this work these biomarkers were analysed in surface sediments along a well characterised sub-Arctic transect in the northernmost Baltic Sea from the Kalix River to the central Bothnian Bay to assess their environmental behaviour and potential for tracing the contribution of soil in this type of system. There was a high BHP diversity and enhanced total BHP concentration in the estuarine sediments, whereas a much less diverse pattern could be observed in the open bay with lower total BHP concentration. In addition, both soil marker BHPs (adenosylhopanes) and branched GDGTs were substantially more abundant in the estuarine than the open bay sediments. The R soil ′ index, based on the Rsoil index minus the contribution from the methylated soil marker BHPs, is suggested as a new approach for tracing soil derived organic matter (OM) in the (sub)-Arctic region. The index decreased along the transect in an off-river direction, correlating strongly with both the branched and isoprenoid tetraether (BIT) index and the stable carbon isotopic composition of the sedimentary organic carbon. These field results indicate that both the R soil ′ and the BIT indices have potential for tracing soil derived OM in sub-Arctic to Arctic waters." ],

DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Four urban areas in Manchester, Salford, Stockport, and Leicester. SUBJECTS: 2152 patients who requested out of hours care, and 49 practice doctors and 183 deputising doctors (61% local principals) who responded to those requests. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Response to call, time to visit, prescribing, and hospital admissions. RESULTS: 1046 calls were dealt with by practice doctors and 1106 by deputising doctors. Practice doctors were more likely to give telephone advice (20.2% v 0.72% of calls) and to visit more quickly than deputising doctors (median delay 35 minutes v 52 minutes). Practice doctors were less likely than deputising doctors to issue a prescription (56.1% v 63.2% of patients) or to prescribe an antibiotic (43.7% v 61.3% of prescriptions issued) and more likely to prescribe genetic drugs (58.4% v 32.1% of drugs prescribed), cheaper drugs (mean cost per prescription pounds 3.28 v pounds 5.04), and drugs in a predefined out of hours formulary (49.8% v 41.1% of drugs prescribed). There was no significant difference in the number of hospital admissions. CONCLUSIONS: By contrast with practice doctors, deputising doctors providing out of hours care less readily give telephone advice, take longer to visit at home, and have patterns of prescribing that may be less discriminating." ],

However, many today lack familiarity with the narratives of traditional religions. In other words, they suffer from ‘religious illiteracy’. This article considers the problem of how religion can become meaningful to such people. The view that religion can be divested of its outdated cultural accoutrements and presented in a form that resonates with postmodern secular culture is considered and found to be problematic. If acquiring a religion is like acquiring a culture, or a language, it seems unlikely that a deeper appreciation of a religious tradition will be facilitated by divesting it of its traditional cultural expressions. Moreover, the view that religious lifestyles should be emphasised rather than religious belief seems to be more a symptom of the problem of ‘religious  illiteracy’ than a solution to it. The article concludes that both of these responses fail to provide a solution to the problem and that an alternative strategy  is urgently required." ],

While the focus is on non-affective psychosis and the schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, the mechanisms underlying suicide behaviour in this group may well underlie or at least influence suicide behaviour in other disorders. The authors describe methods of assessment through individual formulation, and a cognitive behavioural intervention through case studies, to reduce the risk of suicide.This book argues that:· Suicide behaviour lies on a cognitive-behavioural continuum from ideation, through intention to action. · Mechanisms based on biased information processing systems, the development of suicide schema, and appraisal styles are likely to be fruitful in explaining suicidal thoughts and behaviours.· A psychological theory of suicide behaviour is needed in order to develop a mechanism of suicide and to understand the components of suicidal thoughts and behaviours.· Suicide risk can be reduced through the use of the intervention methods described within the text Cognitive Behavioural Prevention of Suicide in Psychosis evaluates practical applications of contemporary research on this topic, and will therefore be of interest to practitioners, post-graduates in training, and researchers studying suicide and/or psychosis." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Using multivariate calibration to evaluate hominin brain/body size relationships", "Modern humans are highly encephalized, having relatively large brains despite our already large bodies. The current assumption is that brains and bodies have both increased in size during the course of human evolution but the rate, timing, and evolutionary relationship of the two are still unclear. This study uses methods that increase the sample size of fossil hominins, provide more confidence in body mass estimates, and allow a comparison of the rate and timing of changes in each trait over the past 4+ million years (mya). \r\n\r\nBrains and bodies show different evolutionary patterns over time. Body size actually shows a decrease in the Pliocene while brains are essentially static. This would have resulted in more encephalized hominins. At the beginning of the Pleistocene (ca. 2.6 mya) body size began to increase and brains began a modest but discernible increase. Body size became static about 1.0 mya and brain size increased sharply around 0.4 mya (close to the appearance of the first Homo sapiens). These patterns indicate that both traits were subject to differing selection (directional or stabilizing) or genetic drift at different times. Their genetic covariation is low; this trait is also subject to selection so the amount of covariation can change throughout time. \r\n\r\n\r\nTaken together, these results suggest a complicated relationship between brain size and body size. Both traits were probably experiencing some direct selection, while also susceptible to indirect selection from the other based on their covariation. The dissimilarities in the change of body size and brain size indicate that their covariation was actively changing during the course of human evolution. Other research indicates that humans have less phenotypic integration than great apes. For example, the transition to bipedalism may have been eased by lowering covariation within the hip, thus reducing evolutionary constraint. This pattern of ``evolvability\" could extend to more general modules or groups of traits, like the skull and brain size, or skeletal and body size. \r\n\r\nChanges in selection on brain size and body size would have been rooted in environmental and life history changes; many life history changes accompany brain size and body size changes. If we examine the analyses of the entire sample, Australopithecines were experiencing decreasing body size and relative stasis in brain size, producing an overall result of encephalization. As brains got relatively larger compared to bodies it was inevitable that at some point either brains would have to get smaller along with bodies or bodies would have to start getting larger to birth large-brained offspring. After 2.6 mya the selection for bigger brains could be responsible for driving larger bodies, but brains show positive allometry relative to bodies. These changing phenotypic relationships suggest changing genetic relationships, indicating a different pattern in integration that began to emerge.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is still much to learn and understand about the evolution of human brains and bodies. These analyses lend some clarity to the rate and timing of evolution of both brain size and body size over time, but the trends are not directly comparable because body size changes linearly over time while brain size shows an exponential increase. Results support previous findings in many ways, including probable changes in energy allocation to support a large brain, an increased rate of evolution in more recent hominins, and changing phenotypic integration. New results include body size decreasing and brain size stasis in the Pliocene, as well as static body size and increasing brains in the Pleistocene" ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "A study of the professional identities of senior school leaders in areas of economic hardship", "This study makes a contribution to the body of work on the impact of education policy aimed at improving schools on the identities of school leaders. It uses the National Challenge as an example of how New Labour attempted to solve the perceived problem of school failure particularly in areas of economic hardship. The aim of the study is to investigate the identities of senior school leaders as they position themselves in relation to the discourses that arise from the neoliberal ideology that has dominated education policy making since the 1980s. These schools are often officially measured and labelled as failing.A literature review locates the research in the political context of education reform over the last thirty years. A review of literature relating to the work of senior leaders in areas of economic hardship traces how knowledge claims and leadership development have shaped their roles throughout this period of post-welfarist reform. It is argued that the policies that have been enacted give rise to discourses which construct some schools as being successful and others as being failures and that the notion of failure is particularly prevalent in area of economic hardship. It is within this environment that senior leaders construct their professional identities meaning that they are required to balance their beliefs and values about the nature and purpose of education with those inherent in the dominant discourses. How these school leaders both shape and are shaped by the policies that they are required to implement is central to the effectiveness of attempts to improve their schools. The work has been structured around three research questions. What are the dominant discourses and models of change in education and how do these both impact on and define schools serving areas of economic hardship? How are senior leaders constructing their professional identity in relation to these discourses and models of change? What are the implications of senior leader identity for development and change in those schools serving areas of economic hardship?The work is a policy scholarship which aims to place the research within its wider historical and sociological context. A discourse analysis of key documents which relate to the National Challenge was carried out and then interviews were conducted with twenty senior leaders. The analysis of the findings include a largely descriptive account of the main themes that emerged and then a more detailed analysis that describes identity in terms of dialogic interactions and conceptualises them using the thinking tools of Bourdieu. Findings from the study make a contribution to the body of knowledge relating to the interaction between education policy influencing school improvement and the identity of those who implement it particularly in areas of economic hardship. The research problematises and challenges some of the assumptions and some of the value inherent in the policies and provides a body of work that will inform future improvement strategies particularly if these are to fully engage and value those who lead these schools. The long term aim would be to ensure that improvement strategies are effective in specific contexts and that there is a shared understanding of both what effective means and what are the desired outcomes of education in these areas. The study reveals how school failure is a construct arising from neoliberal education policy strategy and describes the position of the school leaders using Bourdieu’s concept of hysteresis." ],

  "texts" : [ "How can the concepts of habitus and field help us to understand the engagement of educational workers in higher Education?", "In ‘Making a European area of lifelong learning a reality’, the EU stressed the role of universities in relation to lifelong learning, a role that entails a need for widening access to universities, particularly for those not coming through the traditional direct route of upper secondary education. As teachers play a significant role in the quality of the lifelong learning as well as in motivating future generations to take part in lifelong learning, education and training for teachers becomes important; not only in relation to initial teacher education, but also in relation to a continuous development of knowledge and skills. \r\nThis paper represents the first stage of a larger comparative project intended to examine and compare educational workers’ (i.e. professionals involved in teaching in the class room) participation in higher education in England and Denmark, their access and interest. In particular, the paper relates participation and engagement to national and international educational policies and frames this work within an examination of the social background of the professional groups. The key research questions at this stage of the work are methodological and can be summed up by the overarching question, “How can the concepts of habitus and field help us to understand levels of engagement of educational workers in Higher Education”?\r\nThe paper reports the results of our review of current policies and our efforts to identify the structural relations within the educational professional fields in each country. To do so we are developing a theoretical model using the relational analytical approach advocated by Bourdieu. As such, our work is an early stage attempt at operationalising Bourdieu’s observations regarding the dynamics of field. This seems to us to provide an important conceptual approach to understanding the habitus of educational workers in the context of the dynamics of a fast changing policy arena and the complexities of the backgrounds of individuals working in the educational field. The model attempts to build in the reflexivity that Bourdieu demands for a ‘science’ that is not weakened by over-emphasis on either the objective structural relations or the subjective phenomenology of experience. \r\nThus, the paper presents a preliminary contextual analysis of the factors that enable an understanding of engagement or lack of engagement in higher level learning among school-based education workers in the two EU countries and is related to a larger research project that explores habitus (both individual and collective) among these groups of education workers." ],

Economists and government policy makers see rising debt levels as a natural outcome of lower inflation and nominal interest rates. In fact, growing debt levels are seen as contributing to a wealth effect in these economies, as borrowing more as induced asset price appreciation contributing to new avenues of wealth creation. Conversely, some see rising debt levels as a symptom of eroding of self-control and evidence of the intensification of consumerism in Anglo-American society, as people are now considered to consume without consideration for the limits of income. Increasing indebtedness has also been associated with the deepening disciplinary power of global financein everyday life. This article addresses previous unexplored socio-cultural variables alongside significant market transformations that, together, contributed to escalating levels of consumer debt levels in Anglo-America. In doing so, it asks: what factors contributed to rising consumer debt levels in Anglo-America since the mid-1990s? Rather than putting forward a single causal relationship, rising debt levels are analyzed as a product of the cumulativeeffects of economic changes and socio-cultural factors. In particular, how widespread use of asset-backed securitization (ABS) in consumer credit industry created an increase supply of credit available for lending and a dependence on a growing pool of revolving debtors.Moreover, how stagnant incomes for wage-earners created a new form demand for consumer credit. Finally, how the centrality of consumerism in Anglo-American society provided sufficient cultural justification for consumption despite lower incomes for most wage-earners." ],

I focus mainly on moral claims to bodily authenticity, which differentiate midlife gay men from younger or older gay men and indicate the multidirectional operation of gay ageism. Claims to authentic midlife self-presentation and sexual citizenship work in three ways: first, through reproducing ageism, especially a reverse ageism; second by introducing ambivalences that indicate negotiation with gay ageing and ageism; and third, using resources of ageing like ‘ageing capital’ and at times age-related ‘technologies of the self,’ ageism is subverted by critiquing it and re-claiming the value of age." ],

This paper addresses this question by examining the degree to which job accessibility is associated with reduced work travel and how closely retail-service accessibility is correlated with miles and hours logged getting to shopping destinations. Based on data from the San Francisco Bay Area, we find that jobs-housing balance offers the greatest travel reduction benefits, by a substantial margin. Retail accessibility does significantly increase non-motorized travel, which is important given America’s mounting obesity problem. The paper concludes with a discussion of policy measures introduced in California to bring housing, workplaces, and retail centers closer together." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Spiritual but not religious: a phenomenological study of spirituality in the everyday lives of younger women in contemporary Australia", "In current discussions about contemporary forms of spirituality, consideration is given to the question, what is spirituality and to exploring the range of associated beliefs and practices. Common to most discussions is the acknowledgement that the term spirituality is ambiguous and does not represent any one finite quality or thing, but rather, is a wide and somewhat identifiable set of characteristics. Some commentators suggest that contemporary spirituality, characterised by its separation from institutional forms of religion, and represented by the hallmark expression I am spiritual, but not religious, is an increasing phenomenon in Australian society. In view of this, there are several debates about the merits of a spirituality without explicit links to religion (in particular Christian traditions) and whether a personal spirituality can hold any real depth or purpose, or whether it just perpetuates a superficial, narcissistic focus of the self. This kind of critique pays little attention as to how spirituality, and the associated beliefs and practices, are developed and applied in an everyday sense, and how this impacts on the lives of those who subscribe to their own sense of spirituality. \r\n\r\nIn this thesis, I shift the focus from analysing the merits of a personalised spirituality to exploring in depth some of the lay understandings and purposes underlying contemporary forms of spiritual practice. The primary concern of my thesis is to describe this phenomena of spiritual life as experienced by eleven younger Australian women aged 18-38 years inclusive, who considered themselves 'spiritual' women, yet do not necessarily identify with a particular religious denomination. At its core, and as a phenomenological study, the thesis undertakes a theoretical exploration of consciousness and the apprehension and formation of belief, meaning, and identity. Held central, and alongside the phenomenological methodology, is the feminist notion that every woman is the centre of her own experience, that any interpretations and understandings of women's spirituality, must start with the personal. The empirical stages of research therefore focus on an exploration of the women's personal understandings, experiences, interpretations and translations of spirituality to uncover the location and application of spirituality in everyday life. \r\n\r\nA primary factor explored throughout the thesis is the intersection between emotional experiences, meaning and purpose, and notions of spirituality. It is my assertion that grief, crisis and trauma, and the more general emotional experiences arising from everyday life, can be a driving force to embark on an exploration of the spiritual; inform personal constructions of spirituality; and provide a basis for the articulation of that spirituality, with a central purpose of alleviating emotional pain. Thus, my main thesis contention is this 'new' form of spirituality, as experienced and practiced outside of religious institutions, was expressed by the women in this research as a conscious and pragmatic resource applied, and developed in relation to, the various events and experiences of everyday life, and in relation to the ongoing process of developing and locating a sense of self and identity." ],

In Italy, its organisation relied on a wide network of migrants’ associations. Based on press analysis, participant observations and interviews, this paper focuses on the case study of the Italian Migrants’ Strike, aiming at exploring the political side of the migrants’ participation. After a short description of the event of the 1st March 2010 in Italy, the paper focuses on the migrants’ political and discursive opportunity structure. The analysis indicates that the 1st March event and more recent migrants’ strikes have several elements of similarity with other contemporary political movements. These elements are the search for effective political instruments other than the strike, the process of identity-building and the negotiation between different political cultures." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Crossing Borders and Industry Sectors: Behavioral Governance in Strategic Alliances and Product Innovation for Competitive Advantage", "This paper investigates governance mechanisms in international technology alliances (ITAs), firm-level innovation capabilities, and performance outcomes in the mobile computing market. This high-tech market is characterized by numerous cross-border strategic technology collaborations between software and hardware firms. Anchoring our work in interfirm governance theories and the resource-based view, we develop a model and empirically test relationships related to behavioral governance mechanisms, innovation capabilities, and business performance. In the cross-industry and cross-border context, the empirical model explains to what extent complementary strategic resources, through a relational governance mechanism, contribute to the innovation capabilities of high-tech firms, providing competitive advantage. The data, analyzed using partial least squares (PLS) path modeling, indicates that technological commitment is a factor in expediting technology resource exchange in ITAs between heterogeneous firms. Technological commitment is captured by the extent to which a focal firm commits to investing its technology resources in an ITA to maintain the relationship. The results also show that firm-level performance is only influenced by market development capability, and not new product development capability, in product innovation. However, we did not find any significant moderating effects of firm size and industry type on the model. This paper offers insights into how high-tech firms benefit from interfirm governance in international technology resource exchange arrangements. Furthermore, it provides evidence of the methodological usefulness of PLS path modeling in strategic alliance, capability and performance research." ],

  "title" : "Simulating Attachment to Pure-Play Fashion Retailers",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Simulating Attachment to Pure-Play Fashion Retailers", "The purpose of this thesis is to empirically identify how pure-play fashion retailers can simulate attachment to their websites (through trust, loyalty and purchase intentions) by using different marketing communications media (static product presentation, moving product presentation, guidance and community) to overcome the intangible nature of the online sales environment.The word “simulating” in the title has been chosen due to the nature of the relationship which can exist between a consumer and a pure-play retailer. The word “simulate” means ‘imitate the appearance or character of’ and ‘pretend to have or feel (an emotion)’ (Google a, 2012). A computer facilitates the relationship between a consumer and the pure-play retailer and cannot feel; therefore the relationship cannot exist in a real way and only exists in the eyes of the consumer. Just as a simulator is used for pleasure rides, such as flights or rocket ships, the flight does not exist, but is simulated by a computer and a director who ensures the film starts simultaneously with motion. The same is true for the relationship between a pure-play retailer and a consumer, it is not real, and therefore it is appropriately “simulated”. Descriptive statistics set the scene for a following body of multivariate statistical analysis (EFA, CFA and SEM) using AMOS 16.0. 15 hypothesized relationships are tested after being generated from an extensive literature review. A sample of 688 female young fashion consumers from The University of Manchester participated in this study. There is clear variability in the build up of attachment when a consumer shops for products communicated via different marketing media. Different facets of attachment can be simulated by using static product presentation, moving product presentation and guidance. Community tools can be used to fuel product viewing in rich media and moving formats whilst acting as a discursive platform. Static product presentation has direct relationships with trust and purchase intention, whereas moving product presentations are related to building loyalty. Generalisation of results is limited due to the use of an exclusively female, student sample and the centrality on the UK fashion industry. Further development of the constructs used in this study is needed to further test the conceptual model. This study is one of the first to empirically study pure-play fashion retailing, providing insightful and pragmatic advice by identifying which communication mediums foster enduring relationships with young fashion consumers." ],

  "texts" : [ "The effects of supplier involvement and knowledge protection on product innovation in customer-supplier relationships: a study of global automotive suppliers in China", "Globalization drives firms to develop product innovation through their global supply chains. While innovations generated by supply channel members, as opposed to individual partners, are playing an increasingly important role in the success of all supply chain partners, there has been limited research on how supply chain relationships cultivate the process of such innovation generation, particularly in emerging markets. Correspondingly, this study explores how multinational suppliers can develop adaptive product innovation to create competitive advantage in emerging markets. Drawing on the knowledge-based view and transaction cost economics, this study investigates the influence of supplier involvement and other factors on supplier innovation and performance. The results of a survey of 170 multinational automobile suppliers in China provide support for most of the hypotheses. Specifically, supplier involvement in co-design has an inverted U-shaped relationship with product innovation. Furthermore, knowledge protection, trust and technological uncertainty are all found to drive greater product innovation. In addition, the institutional environment moderates the effect of product innovation on performance. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of how MNEs can acquire local knowledge and develop adaptive products in emerging markets." ],

OBJECTIVE: To study the longer term outcome for patients referred to a Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinic and then given a non-cardiac diagnosis. METHODS: The study collected retrospective data from a cohort of all patients attending the Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinic based in the cardiorespiratory Department at the York District Hospital, England. Questionnaires were sent to all patients who attended the Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinic during the previous 14 months and were diagnosed with non-cardiac chest pain. Participants reported on their chest pain, subsequent episodes of primary and secondary care and their beliefs about causation of pain. RESULTS: Of the patients referred to the Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinic, 235 (52%) did not have cardiac chest pain. Of these patients, 161 (69%) returned the questionnaire, nearly half of whom reported ongoing chest pain. The mean time since Clinic attendance was approximately 8 months and the median duration of ongoing chest pain was 5.4 months. Women were twice as likely as men to continue to be experiencing pain but did not report more frequent or severe pain on average. More than 50% of the non-cardiac group were not convinced by their negative cardiac diagnosis. CONCLUSION: There is an ongoing challenge to support patients with non-cardiac chest pain, including the provision of reassurance that their pain is very unlikely to be caused by their heart." ],

DESIGN: An experimental design with a single between participants factor (actor versus abstainer prototype) was employed. METHOD: Participants in this study were 247 school pupils who completed measures of TPB variables, PWM variables and past behaviour in relation to three health-protective and three health-risk behaviours. RESULTS: Findings indicated that PWM variables accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in behavioural intentions after TPB variables and past behaviour had been taken into account (Mean deltaR2=.05). Perceived similarity to prototypes was the most consistent additional predictor of intention. Actor and abstainer prototypes exhibited equivalent predictive validity. CONCLUSIONS: The present research suggests that variables from the PWM, especially prototype similarity, enhance the predictive validity of the TPB. The findings also provide new evidence that acquiring the characteristics of both health and risk images may be goals among adolescents and suggest that both healthy and risky prototypes constitute useful cognitive targets for interventions." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Increased dietary cholesterol does not increase plasma low density lipoprotein when accompanied by an energy-restricted diet and weight loss.", "BACKGROUND: Diets enriched with dietary cholesterol, frequently from eggs, have been shown to produce a small but variable increase in plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. There is evidence to suggest that energy-restricted diets, that may contain a relatively high proportion of fat and cholesterol, can attenuate the cholesterol-raising effect of dietary cholesterol on plasma LDL. AIM OF THE STUDY: To determine the combined effects of increased dietary cholesterol and weight loss produced by energy restriction on plasma LDL cholesterol and lipoproteins. METHODS: A randomized, controlled, parallel study was performed in two groups of free-living volunteers on an energy-restricted diet for 12 weeks, one group was instructed to consume two eggs a day (n = 24), the other, to exclude eggs (n = 21). Dietary advice on energy restriction was based on the British Heart Foundation guidelines on how to lose weight for men and women. RESULTS: Energy intake fell by 25 and 29% in the egg-fed and non-egg-fed groups, resulting in a moderate weight loss of 3.4 kg (P < 0.05) and 4.4 kg (P < 0.05), respectively. The daily intake of dietary cholesterol increased significantly in the egg-fed group from 278 to 582 mg after 6 weeks. The concentration of plasma LDL cholesterol decreased in the non-egg-fed groups after 6 weeks (P < 0.01) and in the egg-fed and non-egg-fed at 12 weeks relative to baseline. There were no other significant changes in plasma lipoproteins or LDL particle size. CONCLUSIONS: An increased intake of dietary cholesterol from two eggs a day, does not increase total plasma or LDL cholesterol when accompanied by moderate weight loss. These findings suggest that cholesterol-rich foods should not be excluded from dietary advice to lose weight on account of an unfavorable influence on plasma LDL cholesterol." ],

  "title" : "Thread Scheduling Mechanisms for Multiple-Context Parallel Processors",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Thread Scheduling Mechanisms for Multiple-Context Parallel Processors", "Scheduling tasks to efficiently use the  available processor resources is crucial to  minimizing the runtime of applications on  shared-memory parallel processors. One  factor that contributes to poor processor  utilization is the idle time caused by long  latency operations, such as remote memory  references or processor synchronization  operations. One way of tolerating this latency  is to use a processor with multiple hardware  contexts that can rapidly switch to executing  another thread of computation whenever a  long latency operation occurs, thus increasing  processor utilization by overlapping  computation with communication. Although  multiple contexts are effective for tolerating  latency, this effectiveness can be limited by  memory and network bandwidth, by cache  interference effects among the multiple  contexts, and by critical tasks sharing  processor resources with less critical tasks.  This thesis presents techniques that increase  the effectiveness of multiple contexts by  intelligently scheduling threads to make more  efficient use of processor pipeline, bandwidth,  and cache resources. This thesis proposes  thread prioritization as a fundamental  mechanism for directing the thread schedule  on a multiple-context processor. A priority is  assigned to each thread either statically or  dynamically and is used by the thread  scheduler to decide which threads to load in  the contexts, and to decide which context to  switch to on a context switch. We develop a  multiple-context model that integrates both  cache and network effects, and shows how  thread prioritization can both maintain high  processor utilization, and limit increases in  critical path runtime caused by multithreading.  The model also shows that in order to be  effective in bandwidth limited applications,  thread prioritization must be extended to  prioritize memory requests. We show how  simple hardware can prioritize the running of  threads in the multiple contexts, and the  issuing of requests to both the local memory  and the network. Simulation experiments  show how thread prioritization is used in a  variety of applications. Thread prioritization  can improve the performance of  synchronization primitives by minimizing the  number of processor cycles wasted in  spinning and devoting more cycles to critical  threads. Thread prioritization can be used in  combination with other techniques to improve  cache performance and minimize cache  interference between different working sets in  the cache. For applications that are critical  path limited, thread prioritization can improve  performance by allowing processor resources  to be devoted preferentially to critical threads.  These experimental results show that thread  prioritization is a mechanism that can be used  to implement a wide range of scheduling  policies." ],

The speed and power consumption of 3D NoC are compared to that of 2D NoC. Physical constraints, such as the maximum number of planes that can be vertically stacked and the asymmetry between the horizontal and vertical communication channels of the network, are included in speed and power consumption models of these novel 3D structures. An analytic model for the zero-load latency of each network that considers the effects of the topology on the performance of a 3D NoC is developed. Tradeoffs between the number of nodes utilized in the third dimension, which reduces the average number of hops traversed by a packet, and the number of physical planes used to integrate the functional blocks of the network, which decreases the length of the communication channel, is evaluated for both the latency and power consumption of a network. A performance improvement of 40% and 36% and a decrease of 62% and 58% in power consumption is demonstrated for 3D NoC as compared to a traditional 2D NoC topology for a network size of N = 128 and N = 256 nodes, respectively." ],

Many Candida species representing oral microbiota have been shown to be capable of marked acetaldehyde production. The aim of our study was to examine the effects of various sugar alcohols and sugars on microbial acetaldehyde production. The study hypothesis was that xylitol could reduce the amount of acetaldehyde produced by Candida. Laboratory and clinical isolates of seven Candida species were selected for the study. The isolates were incubated in 12 mM ethanol and 110 mM glucose, fructose or xylitol at 37°C for 30 min and the formed acetaldehyde was measured by gas chromatography. Xylitol significantly (p < 0.0001) reduced the amount of acetaldehyde produced from ethanol by 84%. In the absence of xylitol, the mean acetaldehyde production in ethanol incubation was 220.5 μM and in ethanol-xylitol incubation 32.8 μM. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme activity. Coincubation with glucose reduced the amount of produced acetaldehyde by 23% and coincubation with fructose by 29%. At concentrations that are representative of those found in the oral cavity during the intake of proprietary xylitol products, xylitol was found to reduce the production of carcinogenic acetaldehyde from ethanol by Candida below the mutagenic level of 40-100 μM." ],

  "texts" : [ "Yeşilçam Film Posters of the 60s and 70s:  Representing Romance", "<p>Cinema and movie poster have the most powerful potential of establishing the ethos and mythology of people, and both assume an audience on the premises of a cultural context within which they are produced. So a movie poster contributing to mass communication through designed visual means contains a lot of information about film industry, evolution of design, craftsmanship, and the taste of the artists and society as well as standing for a strong evidence of its time. </p>\n<p>\nThe decade 1965-1975 is important for Turkish cinema for being the golden years of this industry. Besides all the good memories associated with these posters, they indeed involve the history of Turkish cinema, graphic design as well as Turkish society. The great deal of labour involved, resulting from the poor resources of the period; design elements, typography, composition, the mistakes; all reflect the characteristics of then-Yeşilçam. Going over an archive of posters and with the help of interviews with designers, cinema historians and labourers, the article focuses on the relationship of design with the industry, technology and society.</p>\n<p>\nThe Yeşilçam movie posters are analyzed through the methods of iconography as well as reception theory. And therefore as well as exploring their graphic and visual characteristics they would be placed in the context of the social life, the conditions of the movie industry in Turkey, the character of Yeşilçam Melodrama and evolution of Turkish movie poster. </p>\n<p>\nAfter a detailed research and observation, four categories are revealed as the most frequently seen types among the Turkish melodrama posters, according to the kind of images in relation to specific themes and concepts and the design schemas they use. These are “star posters”, “beefcake posters”, “phallic woman posters”, and “posters of movement”. The paper goes in detail how these categories are formed and their significance and their relation to the creation of the concept of romance.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Keywords:</strong> <br /> \nYeşilçam melodrama; film poster; graphic design; romance</p>" ],

The research material consists of outdoor advertisements photographed in their actual exhibition places in a city environment. Outdoor advertising media, which are used to communicate visual messages from a sender to several addressees, participate in building the visual city culture and open manifold solutions in design. The visual language used in the research material is analyzed in order to find out how advertising messages, their denotations and connotations, are constructed and how arguments used for persuasion are visualized. </p>\n<p>\nThe first analysis is based on the knowledge and methods used in graphic design practice, which has been defined to be the process of making, choosing and arranging marks in order to convey a message. The analysis shows that different modes, techniques and visual elements are applied to attract the attention of spectators and arouse interest towards the message of an artefact. The second analysis is based on communication studies and semiotics, especially on Roman Jakobson’s theory about the functions of communication. The method of combining two analyses reveals different ways of using visual language and syntaxes to announce the excellence of an advertised product, service or subject. It also shows various types of visual arguments used in advertisements. Three types of visual rhetoric emerge from the research material. They are called brand rhetoric, personalized rhetoric and poetic rhetoric. </p>\n<p>\nThe taxonomy of visual rhetoric exemplifies how visual language can be constructed and used for persuasion. It shows that the decisions in design influence the messages and meanings created. The research calls for further studies as regards the reception of visual rhetoric and suggests that the taxonomy of visual rhetoric could be applied in visual communication design and in the analysis of advertising messages.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Keywords:</strong> <br />\nOutdoor Advertisement/Advertising; Visual Rhetoric; Visual Language; Graphic Design; Visual Communication Design; Advertising Message</p>" ],

Regional differencties, in a public healthcare system.", "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate regional differences in and risk factors for admission, length of stay, mortality, and readmission for community-acquired pneumonia in elderly Danish patients. METHODS: National registry study on elderly Danish citizens with an acute admission in 2009 owing to community-acquired pneumonia. We studied differences among hospitals in length of stay, in-hospital mortality, mortality within 30 days of discharge, and readmission within 30 days after discharge using Cox regression models with adjustments for age, sex, ventilatory support, and co-morbidity by Charlson's index score. RESULTS: A total of 11,332 elderly citizens were admitted with community-acquired pneumonia. Mortality during admission and 30-days from discharge were 11.6% and 16.2%, respectively. Readmission rates within 30 days of discharge were 12.3%. There were significantly differences between hospitals in length of stay. A high Charlson index score and advanced age were significantly risk factors for death during admission and within 30 days of discharge. Male sex and high Charlson index score were significant risk factors for readmission. Admission to large bed capacity hospital was a significant risk factor for death and readmission within 30 days of discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Length of stay, rate of admission, mortality and readmission in elderly Danish patients with community-acquired pneumonia follows international findings. There are regional differences between hospitals. In depth investigation in regional differences could reveal potential feasible clinical interventions with an improvement of readmission-, mortality rates and cost." ],

  "title" : "Three Empirical Essays on Bank Accounting",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Three Empirical Essays on Bank Accounting", "This thesis presents new empirical evidence on three important aspects of financial reporting by banks. The thesis consists of an introductory chapter that explains how the three issues are related to each other, three empirical chapters and a final summary chapter. The first empirical chapter studies the effects of accounting conservatism on the pricing of syndicated bank loans. I provide evidence that banks more timely in loss recognition charge higher spreads for the same loan provision. I go on to consider what happens to this relationship during the financial crisis. During the crisis, banks more timely in loss recognition increase their spreads to a lesser extent than banks less timely in loss recognition. The policy implication is that banks more timely in loss recognition exhibit more prudent and less pro-cyclical debt pricing behaviour. The second empirical chapter examines the relationship between the value relevance of fair value gains and losses and bank risk in an international bank sample. One possibility is that, as risk increases, the scope for subjectivity in fair value estimates increases thereby potentially rendering the numbers less useful. However another possibility is that the relevance of faithfully reported fair value gains and losses increases as risk increases. The study provides evidence that the value relevance of fair value gains and losses is positively associated with bank risk prior to the crisis. During the crisis there is also evidence of a similar positive relationship, but it is not possible to draw firm conclusions for reasons discussed in the chapter. My research also shows that the fair value gains and losses of banks that elect to use the fair value option for assets that could have been accounted for using amortized costs are more value relevant and persistent. This study provides information to policy makers on the situations when fair values are most useful to investors. The third empirical chapter examines if the market rationally prices the loan loss provisions, and the reported fair value gains and losses of US banks. The chapter models the discretionary components of loan loss provisions and fair value gains and losses, and tests if the discretionary components are priced differently from their non-discretionary counterparts. The results provide little evidence that the market misprices operating cash flows, non-discretionary loan loss provisions, or fair value gains and losses (discretionary or otherwise). However there is evidence of significant mispricing of discretionary loan loss provisions. The lack of evidence on the mispricing of fair value gains and losses is consistent with the finding on the value relevance of fair value gains and losses in the second empirical chapter." ],

  "texts" : [ "The Persistence of Accruals and Investment in Operating and Investment Cycle", "<p>This paper investigates the relation between investment and accruals to disentangle earning-fixation hypothesis. We decompose total accruals into working capital accruals, long-term investment and non-transaction accruals to test whether the investment can explain the accruals anomalies and behavior in operating and investment cycle. We use the financial information of 135 firms listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) from 2005 to 2011 through OLS approach and find that long-term investment and non-transaction accruals are able to predict subsequent net income and free cash flow. Whereas, working capital accruals do not have this ability. To predict subsequent ROA, the persistence of total accruals, Long-term investment and external financing decrease in longer operating cycle. Total accruals are more persistent and non-transaction accruals and external financing are less persistent in the longer investment cycle. Total accruals and external financing are inversely related to subsequent returns, implying that accruals anomalies as well as external financing anomalies exist in our sample. To predict future returns, the persistence of total accruals and working capital accruals decrease, however, the persistence of external financing and non-transaction accruals and long-term investment increase in longer operating cycle. Total accruals and non-transaction accruals are more persistent and working capital accruals and long-term investment are less persistent in longer investment cycle, but the persistence of external financing is not related to investment cycle.</p" ],

The integral elastic cross section exhibits three sharp peaks that are nominally shape resonances associated with trapping in the vacant pi* molecular orbitals. Although the two lowest-energy resonances do in fact prove to be nearly pure single-channel shape resonances, the third contains a considerable admixture of core-excited character, and accounting for this channel coupling effect is essential to obtaining an accurate resonance energy. Such resonant channel coupling has implications for electron interactions with the DNA bases, especially the pyrimidine bases for which pyrazine is a close analog. In the absence of data on pyrazine itself, we compare our elastic differential cross section to measurements on benzene and find close agreement." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Apoptosis, intrinsic radiosensitivity and prediction of radiotherapy response in cervical carcinoma", "Apoptosis is an important mechanism of cell death in tumours and it is seen both prior to and following radiotherapy. In this study patients with proven carcinoma of the cervix had measurement made of the percentage of apoptotic cells (apoptotic index or AI) in pre-therapy biopsies. Measurements of intrinsic radiosensitivity (SF2), already shown to be a predictor of outcome, had previously been made on the same pre-therapy biopsies. Mitotic index (MI) and Ki-67 antigen staining were also recorded as markers for proliferation. Patients were divided into those with an AI above or below the median and in general increasing apoptosis was associated with poor prognosis. The 5-year survival rate for tumours with an AI below the median was 79% and was significantly greater than the rate of 47% for those with an AI above the median (p = 0.003). There was also a significantly increased 5-year local recurrence-free rate for patients with an AI below the median compared with those with an AI above the median (79 versus 61%, p = 0.012). In addition, AI and SF2 acted as independent prognostic indicators. Patients with both an SF2 and AI value above the median did badly (25% 5-year survival, 46% local control) compared with those with an SF2 and AI below the median (80% 5-year survival, 100% local control). Apoptosis showed correlation with MI (n = 66, r = 0.34, p = 0.002) and cell staining for the Ki-67 antigen (n = 57, r = 0.25, p = 0.03), but neither MI nor Ki-67 were related to patient outcome. This suggests that while apoptosis may be a reflection of tumour proliferation this cannot in itself explain the ability of apoptosis to predict clinical outcome for this series of patients. The study raises the possibility of AI and SF2 being used together as predictors of tumour response to radiotherapy." ],

This checklist was used in the analysis of\r\nprinciples appearing in 1346 biology and biology-related articles from\r\n671 issues of 15 publications for the year 1967. The publications were\r\nselected to represent all segments of society.\r\nData concerning articles, principles, biology-related social\r\nproblems, and biology topics were analyzed by means of frequencies\r\nand descriptive percentages and are summarized as follows:\r\n1. All the publications surveyed were found to contain biology or\r\nbiology-related articles.\r\n2. One hundred ninety-one of the 195 biological principles in the\r\nchecklist appeared in the articles surveyed. Twenty-two appeared\r\n100 times or more, fifteen appeared 70-99 times, and\r\nfifteen 50-69 times.\r\n3. The greatest frequency of 435 was noted for the principle,\r\n\"Plant and animal diseases are caused by numerous physical\r\nand chemical factors and by various parasitic organisms.\"\r\n4. Of the six areas of biology represented in the checklist, the\r\n46 principles of ecology received the greatest emphasis in the\r\nnews with 45.9 percent and morphology the least with 2.5 percent. 5. Eleven biology-related social problems were identified in 460\r\nof the news articles. Ecology principles received 66.6 percent\r\nof the emphasis and physiology 22.7 percent.\r\n6. News articles other than those concerning biology-related social\r\nproblems were grouped under nine biology topics or classifications.\r\nThose receiving greatest emphasis were applied\r\nbiology (predominantly health and disease) with 331 or 30.9\r\npercent of the articles and animal life (predominantly mammals\r\nand birds) with 217 or 20.3 percent.\r\n7. The BSCS texts were analyzed for the presence, location, and\r\nemphasis of the biological principles appearing most frequently\r\nin the public press. None of the principles were omitted in the\r\nthree texts. The Yellow and Green versions gave the 100 most\r\nfrequent principles in the news the most emphasis.\r\nThe following conclusions were drawn from this study: (1) The\r\npublic press does include many biology and biology-related articles\r\nwhich contain many of the basic principles of biology; and (2) There\r\nis a close relationship between biological principles found in articles\r\nof the public press and those stressed in the modern type introductory\r\nbiology texts surveyed in this study." ],

  "title" : "(Neo-) Polanyian perspectives on Technology-Economy relations",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "(Neo-) Polanyian perspectives on Technology-Economy relations", "This article explores some enduring themes in Karl Polany’s work with particular attention to his life-long concern with the subject Freedom. In contrast to the dominant focus on Economy-Society relations, which perhaps results from disproportionate attention contemporary Polanyi scholars pay to his seminal work The Great Transformation (TGT); this paper calls for a broader thematic analysis of Polany’s life-work spanning concerns of Freedom-Society-Technology-Economy, and their inter-relations. These themes are visible in his writing from the 1920s to the early 1960s but were explicitly brought together in a normative critique that Polanyi and Rotstein began but never finished, in a book they had entitled Freedom and Technology. Polanyi expressed the concern that modern technologies have the capacity to ‘numb’ society because of their ubiquitous nature – the combination of omnipresence and invisibility. Technological Civilisation is the outcome of a set of conditions whereupon humanity is so submerged within the affective powers of mass technology, that there is a corresponding mass-desensitisation to its powers. But he was not anti-technology. Technology brings benefits as well as threats to society. What concerns Polanyi from a normative standpoint, is that technologies enable human relationships (in particular relations of economic organisation) to be conducted  beyond the ‘human’ scale. At the same time actors immersed in these relationships are dehumanised. The mode of organising and facilitating the relationship overtakes the original purpose, meaning, and understanding of it. The consequence of dual expansion, namely technological expansion and expansion of economic organisation - indeed as a result of each providing the means for the expansion of the other – is that original logics of human wellbeing are lost. A particular expression of Technology-Economy relations takes over, mediated by the rationales of Technical Agencies. We add that a series of dialectical double movements are evident, beyond the market-society double movement that Polanyi puts forward in TGT. The paper illustrates these ideas in the contemporary case of designing a system of exchanges in order to trade in permits and credits of greenhouse gas emissions known collectively as ‘carbon markets’. The paper finishes by offering some preliminary (Polanyi-inspired) theoretical reflections on the notion of technologising processes." ],

The literature review systematically explores research that has examined changes in attachment representations during psychological therapy. The purpose of the review is to enhance understanding of change processes in adult attachment and to provide empirical support to the premises of attachment theory. In spite of inconsistencies with regards to measurement and conceptualisation of attachment, the evidence suggests that attachment security increases during therapy, whereas insecurity decreases.The aim of the empirical paper was to examine the association between global adult attachment representations, specific attachment to the therapist, working alliance and response to individual Cognitive-Behaviour Therapy (CBT). The study also investigated changes in global attachment representations and their relationship with outcome. The results indicated that clients with greater secure attachment to the therapist showed greater improvements in symptoms, whereas clients with higher avoidant-fearful attachment to the therapist demonstrated less improvement. Significant improvements in attachment avoidance and anxiety were also associated with improvements in psychological symptoms, as was working alliance. No associations between adult global attachment and outcome were found. In paper 3, the approaches used within the current thesis are evaluated in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. Clinical implications of the findings are discussed and ideas for future research are outlined." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "The determinants of FDI distribution across manufacturing activities in an Asian industrialising country: a case of Japanese FDI in Thailand", "This research identifies and investigates the 'industry-level determinants' of FDI in the context of Asian industrialising countries by using the data on Japanese foreign direct investment in Thailand. It differs from previous empirical studies for non-industrialised countries in three important aspects. Firstly, the previous studies (e. g. Lall and Mohammad, 1983) focus on the determinants of FDI in terms of monopolistic characteristics of industries in which foreign firms operate (e.g. technological intensities and scale economies). The present study, on the other hand, examines the influences of locational-specific characteristics of host industries such as factor endowments, trade costs, and policy factors. More distinctively, it examines the effects of vertical (input-output) linkages among Japanese firms. These effects have rarely been investigated in the context of Asian industrialising countries. Thirdly, it constructs the highly disaggregated data on FDI (4-digit ISIC level), using a broad range of information gathered from various published sources. Such data allow the present analysis to examine in detail the 'pattern' and 'determinants' of FDI distribution across segmented stages of manufacturing production rather than broadly defined industrial sectors.\r\n\r\nOn analysing descriptively the manufacturing distribution of FDI, it was found that Japanese FDI in Thailand was not evenly distributed across manufacturing activities. Some capital- / technology-intensive industries like rail equipment (ISIC 3842) and aircraft (ISIC 3845) did not receive (or host) any FDI during a specified period (1954-1995). On the other hand, other relatively labour-intensive industries like TV, radio, and communication equipment industry (ISIC 3832) and motor vehicle industry (ISIC 3843) received disproportionately large values of FDI. Based on the locational approach to the determinants of FDI in non-industrialised countries, several hypotheses were formulated and quantitatively tested by using cross-sectional data (1985,1990, and 1995). The empirical findings lend strong and consistent support to the postulated hypotheses. It is to be hoped that these empirical findings will not only enhance our understanding of the industry-level determinants of FDI in the context of Asian industrialising countries but also stimulate further work on this line of research." ],

By testing the birds on all possible pair-wise combinations of syllables, we generated \"similarity\" matrices for these song syllables from the birds'response latencies to detect changes in a repeating background of syllables. A number of different statistical techniques were used to examine species differences in perception including factor analysis of an inter-species correlation matrix, cluster analysis ofthe similarity matrices, and individual-differences multidimensional scaling (MDS) of the similarity matrices from each species. The spatial map of these stimuli produced by MDS revealed the perceived relations among these syllables for each species. Several acoustic measurements taken from these syllables were correlated with stimulus coordinates of the syllables in multidimensional space. These results demonstrate that natural vocal signals can be effectively used as stimuli in psychoacoustic experiments and the outcome of such experiments are likely to reveal robust species differences in perception. \n       \n       " ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Effects of financing on the investment of Dutch SMEs during the financial crisis", "This study investigates the effect of the recent financial crisis on the investment of Dutch SMEs (small and medium sized enterprises). Precisely, the focus is on the availability of internal finance and external finance of Dutch SMEs and their effect on the investments during the recent financial crisis. It is hypothesized that, investments of SMEs declined significantly during the financial crisis due to the supply shock of external finance (bank credit) and less cash flows generated by SMEs because of sluggish economic condition. It is also hypothesized that, during the financial crisis internal finance (cash flows) would determine more investment than the external finance (bank credit). Because cash flows become a distinct source of investment than the external finance due to market imperfections. As Dutch SMEs are more dependent on banks for the external sources of finance, financial crisis would affect their business activity negatively. To investigate the effect of financial crisis, finance and investment related data of Dutch SMEs are collected over the period of 2004-2012. SMEs are classified by the European commission definition. Firms are included which are active during the sample period. Financial institutions, nonprofit and government firms are excluded due to the nature of the study. The final sample consists of 2,890 investment observations. In this study unbalanced panel data have been used. OLS regression model has been implied to investigate the effect of financing (i.e. cash flows and bank credit) on the investment during the financial crisis. In all of the regressions, industry dummy has been used to control the individual industry effects. Besides, size, age, growth opportunity are used as control variables. \r\n\r\nThe results suggest that the financial crisis has induced a negative credit supply shock which adversely affected the investment of private SMEs in the Netherlands. The results further highlight that, the financial crisis has weakened the supply of short term bank finance and long term bank finance to Dutch SMEs. Overall, the results suggest that investment of private Dutch SMEs are vulnerable to variations in the supply of bank credit which may have long-term implications for the survival and growth of these firms, which in turn might have a negative effect in the economy. The findings show that, bank credit determined more investment during the financial crisis than any other financing source. The results signify that a financial crisis may restrict the SMEs ability to finance investment, which would in turn affect the growth while this may not be a matter of concern in normal state of the economy" ],

The project involves contributions of partners from different fields of research. Thus, lifeClipper2 is able to test the potential of AR for visualizing architecture and archaeological information and to challenge our understanding of perception and interaction. Using examples from our research, the paper reflects on how scenario design contributes to the production of design knowledge and explores the possibilities and variations of AR.

The research is undertaken in the context of a large, rural Local Authority and is related to the broad theme of cognition and learning in children and young people.   The researcher adopts a Q-methodology to consider the subjective and collective viewpoints of educational psychologists in the Local Authority with regard to dyslexia and using factor analysis to process the data, three distinct viewpoints emerged.  The literature review included in the thesis seeks to provide an overview of the research base which underpins formative assessment practices in educational settings in the UK.  The importance of the role of teacher feedback in classroom learning is illustrated through meta-analyses research and studies.  Formative assessment is considered in the review within the conceptual framework of constructivist learning theory.  The role of pupil feedback in a junior classroom is then explored in a qualitative research study using a collaborative action research methodology.  Thematic analysis is used to analyse the textual data from interviews with the participant teacher.  The action research methodology was an effective model to enable the teacher to effect change in her practice.  The three papers are set within an organisational context in the thesis, current challenges for the profession are summarised and many examples are given of the role and importance of research in the work of an educational psychologist.    Implications for further research within the profession of educational psychology are suggested." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "THE FUTILITY OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IN LIGHT OF IMPERFECT MARKET PRICING", "This thesis addresses the mechanics of executive remuneration from an unorthodox perspective; the view presented through the lens of imperfect market pricing. Whilst many of the criticisms of existing compensation arrangements are merited, they ignore the integrity of a crucial aspect of the way remuneration awards are calculated; the market pricing mechanism. The original contribution of knowledge of this thesis is to explain how imperfect market pricing undermines the utility of stock-based compensation awards, especially in light of the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-11 (‘GFC’).The existing position with regard to Anglo-American corporate governance emphasises the role of the market in determining optimal governance solutions. However, the market cannot regulate all conflicts. For example, the separation of ownership and control in modern corporations creates an agency problem whereby managerial and shareholder interests may diverge. Public companies therefore use performance-related pay to align the interests of management with those of firm owners. This performance-related pay often includes an element with a specific link to the price of company stock. A by-product of these arrangements is that incentives are created for executives to inflate the value of their companies in order to benefit from short-run price appreciation. This reduces the utility of stock-based pay and encourages market short-termism. There is however, a further fundamental flaw in the use of stock-based pay; it places complete faith in modern finance theory; a theory which asserts that market pricing is flawless (the so-called Efficient Capital Markets Hypothesis). However, financial and asset markets are susceptible to forces which drive prices away from intrinsic value for protracted periods and contribute to serious price distortion. Behavioural finance explains how these distortions occur and provides a more appropriate paradigm for securities market operation. The Financial Instability Hypothesis (‘FIH’) also explains how endogenous instability, emanating from the banking sector, arises as an inevitable consequence of the functioning of the capitalist economy. It further demonstrates how markets may be driven away from fundamental value, how asset bubbles occur, and how the market pricing mechanism is seriously distorted. The most serious recent crisis, the GFC, exhibited the FIH taxonomy. It exposed serious flaws in modern finance theory and revealed the dangers of flawed incentive systems in generating asset bubbles. Executives at financial institutions stand accused of short-termism, over-leveraging and poor risk management. Monitoring of management was impossible to perform effectively due to various behavioural and structural obstacles arising from the size and complexity of the institutions concerned. Moreover, a system of perverse incentives led to the failure of effective regulation of executive compensation.Reform is therefore required. The thesis will conclude with a critical analysis of recent amendments to the regulation of compensation systems at financial institutions. Based on this examination, the thesis will make some proposals for future remuneration packages in the wider economy. These proposals are designed to reduce the potential for financial instability through removing incentives for firm executives to concentrate on short-term results, and emphasize the role of qualitative indices of performance." ],

  "texts" : [ "Risk perception of travelers to tropical and subtropical countries visiting a Swiss travel health center", "BACKGROUND: This study assessed the risk perception ratings of travelers pre- and post-travel and in comparison to the ratings by travel health experts. While most surveys on travel health knowledge, attitudes, and practices focus on malaria and vaccine-preventable diseases, noninfectious travel risks were included in this study.METHODS: Pre- and post-travel perception of nine travel-associated health risks was recorded among 314 travelers to tropical and subtropical destinations. All travelers sought pre-travel health advice at the Travel Clinic of the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute in 2008 and 2009. In addition, 18 Swiss travel health experts provided an assessment of the respective risks. A validated visual psychometric measuring instrument was used [pictorial representation of illness and self measure (PRISM)]. RESULTS: Travelers and experts rated most risks similarly, except for accidents and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) which experts rated higher. Compared to other risks, accidents ranked highly in both groups and were the only risk perceived higher after travel. Pre- and post-travel perceptions of all other risks were similar with a tendency to be lower after travel. Travelers perceived mosquitoes to be the highest risk before travel and accidents after travel.CONCLUSION: Travelers' risk perception appears to be accurate for most risks stated in this study. However, travel health professionals should be aware that some perception patterns among travelers regarding travel-related health risks may be different from professional risk assessment. Important but insufficiently perceived health risks, such as sexual behavior/STIs and accidents, should be considered to be part of any pre-travel health advice package." ],

  "title" : "Financial Markets and Real Ecinomy: Four Essays in International Trade",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Financial Markets and Real Ecinomy: Four Essays in International Trade", "Financial markets play an important role in an economy performing various functions like mobilizing and pooling savings, producing information about investment opportunities, screening and monitoring investments, implementation of corporate governance, diversification and management of risk. These functions influence saving rates, investment decisions, technological innovation and, therefore, have important implications for welfare. In my PhD dissertation I examine the interplay of financial and product markets by looking at different channels through which financial markets may influence an economy.My dissertation consists of four chapters. The first chapter is a co-authored work with Martin Strieborny, a PhD student from the University of Lausanne. The second chapter is a co-authored work with Melise Jaud, a PhD student from the Paris School of Economics. The third chapter is co-authored with both Melise Jaud and Martin Strieborny. The last chapter of my PhD dissertation is a single author paper.Chapter 1 of my PhD thesis analyzes the effect of financial development on growth of contract intensive industries. These industries intensively use intermediate inputs that neither can be sold on organized exchange, nor are reference-priced (Levchenko, 2007; Nunn, 2007). A typical example of a contract intensive industry would be an industry where an upstream supplier has to make investments in order to customize a product for needs of a downstream buyer. After the investment is made and the product is adjusted, the buyer may refuse to meet a commitment and trigger ex post renegotiation. Since the product is customized to the buyer's needs, the supplier cannot sell the product to a different buyer at the original price. This is referred in the literature as the holdup problem. As a consequence, the individually rational suppliers will underinvest into relationship-specific assets, hurting the downstream firms with negative consequences for aggregate growth. The standard way to mitigate the hold up problem is to write a binding contract and to rely on the legal enforcement by the state. However, even the most effective contract enforcement might fail to protect the supplier in tough times when the buyer lacks a reliable source of external financing. This suggests the potential role of financial intermediaries, banks in particular, in mitigating the incomplete contract problem. First, financial products like letters of credit and letters of guarantee can substantially decrease a risk and transaction costs of parties. Second, a bank loan can serve as a signal about a buyer's true financial situation, an upstream firm will be more willing undertake relationship-specific investment knowing that the business partner is creditworthy and will abstain from myopic behavior (Fama, 1985; von Thadden, 1995). Therefore, a well-developed financial (especially banking) system should disproportionately benefit contract intensive industries.The empirical test confirms this hypothesis. Indeed, contract intensive industries seem to grow faster in countries with a well developed financial system. Furthermore, this effect comes from a more developed banking sector rather than from a deeper stock market. These results are reaffirmed examining the effect of US bank deregulation on the growth of contract intensive industries in different states. Beyond an overall pro-growth effect, the bank deregulation seems to disproportionately benefit the industries requiring relationship-specific investments from their suppliers.Chapter 2 of my PhD focuses on the role of the financial sector in promoting exports of developing countries. In particular, it investigates how credit constraints affect the ability of firms operating in agri-food sectors of developing countries to keep exporting to foreign markets.Trade in high-value agri-food products from developing countries has expanded enormously over the last two decades offering opportunities for development. However, trade in agri-food is governed by a growing array of standards. Sanitary and Phytosanitary standards (SPS) and technical regulations impose additional sunk, fixed and operating costs along the firms' export life. Such costs may be detrimental to firms' survival, \"pricing out\" producers that cannot comply. The existence of these costs suggests a potential role of credit constraints in shaping the duration of trade relationships on foreign markets. A well-developed financial system provides the funds to exporters necessary to adjust production processes in order to meet quality and quantity requirements in foreign markets and to maintain long-standing trade relationships. The products with higher needs for financing should benefit the most from a well functioning financial system. This differential effect calls for a difference-in-difference approach initially proposed by Rajan and Zingales (1998). As a proxy for demand for financing of agri-food products, the sanitary risk index developed by Jaud et al. (2009) is used. The empirical literature on standards and norms show high costs of compliance, both variable and fixed, for high-value food products (Garcia-Martinez and Poole, 2004; Maskus et al., 2005). The sanitary risk index reflects the propensity of products to fail health and safety controls on the European Union (EU) market. Given the high costs of compliance, the sanitary risk index captures the demand for external financing to comply with such regulations.The prediction is empirically tested examining the export survival of different agri-food products from firms operating in Ghana, Mali, Malawi, Senegal and Tanzania. The results suggest that agri-food products that require more financing to keep up with food safety regulation of the destination market, indeed sustain longer in foreign market, when they are exported from countries with better developed financial markets.Chapter 3 analyzes the link between financial markets and efficiency of resource allocation in an economy. Producing and exporting products inconsistent with a country's factor endowments constitutes a serious misallocation of funds, which undermines competitiveness of the economy and inhibits its long term growth. In this chapter, inefficient exporting patterns are analyzed through the lens of the agency theories from the corporate finance literature. Managers may pursue projects with negative net present values because their perquisites or even their job might depend on them. Exporting activities are particularly prone to this problem. Business related to foreign markets involves both high levels of additional spending and strong incentives for managers to overinvest. Rational managers might have incentives to push for exports that use country's scarce factors which is suboptimal from a social point of view. Export subsidies might further skew the incentives towards inefficient exporting. Management can divert the export subsidies into investments promoting inefficient exporting.Corporate finance literature stresses the disciplining role of outside debt in counteracting the internal pressures to divert such \"free cash flow\" into unprofitable investments. Managers can lose both their reputation and the control of \"their\" firm if the unpaid external debt triggers a bankruptcy procedure. The threat of possible failure to satisfy debt service payments pushes the managers toward an efficient use of available resources (Jensen, 1986; Stulz, 1990; Hart and Moore, 1995). The main sources of debt financing in the most countries are banks. The disciplining role of banks might be especially important in the countries suffering from insufficient judicial quality. Banks, in pursuing their rights, rely on comparatively simple legal interventions that can be implemented even by mediocre courts. In addition to their disciplining role, banks can promote efficient exporting patterns in a more direct way by relaxing credit constraints of producers, through screening, identifying and investing in the most profitable investment projects. Therefore, a well-developed domestic financial system, and particular banking system, would help to push a country's exports towards products congruent with its comparative advantage.This prediction is tested looking at the survival of different product categories exported to US market. Products are identified according to the Euclidian distance between their revealed factor intensity and the country's factor endowments. The results suggest that products suffering from a comparative disadvantage (labour-intensive products from capital-abundant countries) survive less on the competitive US market. This pattern is stronger if the exporting country has a well-developed banking system. Thus, a strong banking sector promotes exports consistent with a country comparative advantage.Chapter 4 of my PhD thesis further examines the role of financial markets in fostering efficient resource allocation in an economy. In particular, the allocative efficiency hypothesis is investigated in the context of equity market liberalization.Many empirical studies document a positive and significant effect of financial liberalization on growth (Levchenko et al. 2009; Quinn and Toyoda 2009; Bekaert et al., 2005). However, the decrease in the cost of capital and the associated growth in investment appears rather modest in comparison to the large GDP growth effect (Bekaert and Harvey, 2005; Henry, 2000, 2003). Therefore, financial liberalization may have a positive impact on growth through its effect on the allocation of funds across firms and sectors.Free access to international capital markets allows the largest and most profitable domestic firms to borrow funds in foreign markets (Rajan and Zingales, 2003). As domestic banks loose some of their best clients, they reoptimize their lending practices seeking new clients among small and younger industrial firms. These firms are likely to be more risky than large and established companies. Screening of customers becomes prevalent as the return to screening rises. Banks, ceteris paribus, tend to focus on firms operating in comparative-advantage sectors because they are better risks. Firms in comparative-disadvantage sectors finding it harder to finance their entry into or survival in export markets either exit or refrain from entering export markets. On aggregate, one should therefore expect to see less entry, more exit, and shorter survival on export markets in those sectors after financial liberalization.The paper investigates the effect of financial liberalization on a country's export pattern by comparing the dynamics of entry and exit of different products in a country export portfolio before and after financial liberalization.The results suggest that products that lie far from the country's comparative advantage set tend to disappear relatively faster from the country's export portfolio following the liberalization of financial markets. In other words, financial liberalization tends to rebalance the composition of a country's export portfolio towards the products that intensively use the economy's abundant factors." ],

  "texts" : [ "Hybrid Composites of Polyaniline/Modified Carbon Nanoparticles Employed as Highly Sensitive Ammonia Sensors on Flexible Substrates", "Fabrication of low-cost and low-power chemical sensors on flexible substrates is aimed to open new applications in environmental monitoring and smart food packaging. Polyaniline (PANI), known for its excellent gas sensing properties, reversibly interacts with ammonia causing a significant decrease in its conductivity. By utilizing composites of PANI and carbon-based materials enhanced sensitivity toward amines has been observed. However, lack of solution processability has limited implementation of these materials in conventional flexible sensor fabrication methods. Here, we have prepared hybrid carbon/PANI composite NH3 sensors using low-cost solution deposition methods. Sulfosuccinic acid, a multifunctional dopant, has been used to make electrically conducting polyaniline solutions in aprotic solvents, and these were characterised by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Hybrid composites were made by simply mixing surface modified carbon nanoparticles (20 wt.%) into doped PANI solution. Chemiresistors were fabricated on PEN and Kapton® flexible substrates incorporating gold and silver interdigitated electrodes (20 µm gap), using drop casting and spin coating methods. The response of the sensor towards NH3 vapour concentrations in the range of 200 ppb to 2 ppm was measured and compared to that of a conventional MOS ammonia sensor. The effect of different substrates, electrode materials and deposition methods used were investigated. Successful fabrication of a low-power sensor with repeatable and reproducible response with sensitivities up to 5 times higher than MOS sensors, together with response and recovery times in minutes was achieved. The excellent performance parameters make these flexible hybrid nanocomposite materials, attractive candidates for replacing conventional MOS sensors for low-power, real-time ammonia sensing applications.(This work was supported by FlexSMELL-FP7-PEOPLE-ITN-2008-238454.)" ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Extrapyramidal motor side-effects of first- and second-generation antipsychotic drugs.", "BACKGROUND: Second-generation antipsychotics have been thought to cause fewer extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS) than first-generation antipsychotics, but recent pragmatic trials have indicated equivalence. AIMS: To determine whether second-generation antipsychotics had better outcomes in terms of EPS than first-generation drugs. METHOD: We conducted an intention-to-treat, secondary analysis of data from an earlier randomised controlled trial (n = 227). A clinically significant difference was defined as double or half the symptoms in groups prescribed first- v. second-generation antipsychotics, represented by odds ratios greater than 2.0 (indicating advantage for first-generation drugs) or less than 0.5 (indicating advantage for the newer drugs). We also examined EPS in terms of symptoms emergent at 12 weeks and 52 weeks, and symptoms that had resolved at these time points. RESULTS: At baseline those randomised to the first-generation antipsychotic group (n = 118) had similar EPS to the second-generation group (n = 109). Indications of resolved Parkinsonism (OR = 0.5) and akathisia (OR = 0.4) and increased tardive dyskinesia (OR = 2.2) in the second-generation drug group at 12 weeks were not statistically significant and the effects were not present by 52 weeks. Patients in the second-generation group were dramatically (30-fold) less likely to be prescribed adjunctive anticholinergic medication, despite equivalence in terms of EPS. CONCLUSIONS: The expected improvement in EPS profiles for participants randomised to second-generation drugs was not found; the prognosis over 1 year of those in the first-generation arm was no worse in these terms. The place of careful prescription of first-generation drugs in contemporary practice remains to be defined, potentially improving clinical effectiveness and avoiding life-shortening metabolic disturbances in some patients currently treated with the narrow range of second-generation antipsychotics used in routine practice. This has educational implications because a generation of psychiatrists now has little or no experience with first-generation antipsychotic prescription." ],

  "texts" : [ "'Beer used to belong to older men' : drink and authority among the Nyakyusa of Tanzania.", "In her last major work on social change among the Nyakyusa of southwestern Tanzania, Monica Wilson returned to an argument about the changing role of beer drinking which had featured in her earlier writings (1963: 176, 1977: 92-3, 131). She suggested that the selling of locally made grain beer for cash, and its consumption in commercial clubs, had played a major role in altering relationships between young and old, and men and women. Generational separation had broken down: young men had lost respect for elder men and women had acquired a new economic autonomy founded on the cash income they earned from selling beer. Beer thus lay at the heart of a pattern of social change (1977: 186). \r\nThis article examines changes in authority and the drinking of beer in Nyakyusa society from the 1890s-when written records become available-to the end of the twentieth century. It argues that patterns of deference and authority have suffered less dislocation than Wilson suggested and that-while locally made grain beer has been physically transformed, has disappeared from certain public rituals of well-being and has come increasingly into the cash market-its commoditisation has not necessarily empowered women, nor has it eliminated the role of beer in patterns of behaviour and discourse which sustain elder men's claims to authority." ],

  "texts" : [ "High tryptophan diet reduces CA1 intraneuronal β-amyloid in the triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease", "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that impairs mnesic functions. The histopathology of the disease is manifested by the accumulation of intracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) and subsequent formation of neuritic plaques as well as the presence neurofibrillary tangles in specific brain regions associated with learning and memory including the hippocampus. Here, we analysed the effect of chronic (1 month) food diets containing low (LTrP), normal (NTrP) and high tryptophan (HTrP), 0.04, 0.20 and 0.40 g/100 g, respectively, on CA1 serotonin transporter (SERT) fibre density, intraneuronal Aβ deposition and total number of serotonergic (5-HT) neurons in an AD triple transgenic (3xTg-AD) mouse model. Nontransgenic (non-Tg) animals fed with HTrP displayed increased SERT fibre density in CA1 (35%) and in stratum lacunosum moleculare (S.Mol) (48%) compared to LTrP diet. Transgenic animals showed increased SERT fibre density in CA1 S.Mol compared to diet-matched non-Tg irrespective of dietary tryptophan content (104% for LTrP, 74% for NTrP and 35% for HTrP); no differences were observed in the total number of 5-HT neurons neither in the dorsal nor in the median raphe nuclei. However, and more relevant to AD, HTrP diet reduced intraneuronal Aβ density (by a 17%) in transgenic animals compared to transgenic animals fed with NTrP diet. Our results show that increased dietary TrP intake reduces intraneuronal Aβ load in the 3xTg-AD mouse model of AD, suggesting that enhanced TrP intake and in consequence a potential increase in 5-HT neurotransmission may be effective in reducing plaque pathology in AD." ],

An intent-to-treat analysis, including those patients (n = 28) who discontinued clozapine during the study period, showed a significant reduction in number of admissions and total time spent in hospital in the 2 years following clozapine initiation compared to the previous 2 years and to the follow-up period in the control group. This translated into a reduction of £7300 in hospitalization costs per patient started on clozapine, over the 2-year period. In those patients whocontinued clozapine treatment for the whole of the 2-year period, there was a two-thirds reduction in number of admissions and total time spent in hospital compared to no change in the clozapine discontinuers. These findings suggest that clozapine is a clinically and cost-effective intervention for severe schizophrenia in routine clinical settings." ],

  "texts" : [ "Designing for construction automation: Advanced automation technologies for computer integrated construction", "One of the primary technical barriers to construction automation is the inability of advanced manufacturing production technologies to perform many construction activities. Current construction methods have evolved based on the physical, sensory, and decision making abilities of human beings. Machine sensor and adaptive capabilities are not nearly as sophisticated as those of humans and, therefore, automated machinery cannot accomplish many construction operations as they are presently performed with manual techniques. To automate many construction activities, operations must be designed that are within the capabilities of the machinery. A quantitative method is needed to evaluate and measure the amenability that construction tasks have to automation. The amenability of a construction task to automation is defined as \"automated constructibility\". A method to measure automated constructibility is needed to \"Design for Construction Automation\".This research addresses the issue of automated constructibility. A quantitative method to evaluate automated constructibility of construction tasks is developed. This method analyzes design characteristics through a process of reverse construction and converts them into construction requirements. The construction requirements contain motion, accuracy, stability, and environmental characteristics of the construction task. These characteristics are converted into a \"task manifold chart\" and a \"task performance environment chart\", which comprise the automated constructibility criteria. Certain patterns of automated constructibility criteria indicate automated constructibility and technical feasibility for automation in the performance of that task" ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Essays on Closed-end Funds", "This thesis is comprised of three separate empirical chapters on the closed-end fund industry. The first chapter examines the performance and trading volume of UK Venture Capital Trusts (VCTs) focusing on the expiry of the minimum holding period required for investors to gain income tax relief on VCT shares bought at flotation. The second explores the effect of repurchase transactions on the stock liquidity of UK closed-end funds. The third chapter investigates the relationship between pay-performance sensitivity (PPS) and fund risk of US closed-end funds. The first empirical chapter finds negative abnormal returns and permanent increases in trading volumes at and around the expiry of the required holding periods of VCTs. VCTs investing in companies listed on the Alternative Investment Market experience higher abnormal returns and lower abnormal trading volumes than VCTs investing in unquoted companies. VCTs with better asset performance during the required holding period have lower abnormal returns and higher abnormal trading volumes. Income tax relief becomes more generous (increases from 20 to 40 percent) and holding periods shorter (from five to three years) over the sample period. The more generous (to the investors) the income tax relief, the higher the abnormal returns and the lower the abnormal trading volumes.  The second empirical chapter reports that repurchase transactions improve the stock liquidity of closed-end funds suggesting that funds act as “competing market makers”. However, the positive liquidity effect of repurchase transactions is short-lived and positively affected by the frequency of repurchase transactions. The positive effect seems to have been increased by the change in repurchase regulations on 1st December 2003 that allowed funds to re-issue repurchased shares and appears to have increased the ability of funds to manage their stock liquidity.The third empirical chapter finds that fund risk has a positive impact on fund PPS, suggesting that shareholders need to provide greater compensation incentives to managers of riskier firms to reduce the adverse selection problem. PPS has a positive effect on fund risk, which suggests that, in the closed-end fund industry, the increase in the value of the fund manager’s wealth due to a higher PPS outweighs the negative effect of increased pay volatility on the manager’s expected utility." ],

This paper reports on the recent research on the engineering design and evaluation of 2D and 3D fabrics emphasising on the influence of construction of ballistic fabrics on ballistic performance. Based on preliminary research, a new concept of fabrics with material continuity and enhanced yarn gripping was put forward. Accordingly, fabrics with enhanced yarn gripping were engineered, manufactured, and evaluated, and results showed improved ballistic performance in terms of both projectile penetration and trauma impact. Based on the new concept, 2D and 3D fabric constructions were discussed for ballistic protection. Formation of 3D panels was investigated and it was found that angle-layering for creating panels improves the isotropy and hence better impact performance. Hybrid design of ballistic panels from the commonly used woven and UD fabrics indicated that it is possible to improve the ballistic performance by using layer materials according to the impact mechanism. FE simulation was also carried out for the investigation of strain distribution in the ballistic fabrics and panels, which provides information for optimisation of fabric construction." ],

This systematic literature review set out to explore: how teachers use research; which features of research encourage teachers to use research findings in their own practice; whether medical practitioners make greater use of research findings than teachers; and approaches to dissemination. Two key ideas emerge from this review. First, there appear to be common barriers to research use in both medicine and in education. Findings suggest that there is a need to create a culture in the public sector which supports and values research. There are, however, a number of factors, which appear to be more specific to the education field. Key differences in the way that research knowledge is constructed in the social sciences has led to researchers being challenged about their findings, particularly in relation to the context, generalisability and validity of the research. For these reasons the development of communication networks, links between researchers and practitioners, and greater involvement of practitioners in the research process, have emerged as strategies for improving research impact.</p>" ],

The sequential quadratic programmingis a gradient based local search method designed to deriveeffective search directions by using exact Hessians obtained viaa vectorized forward accumulation of derivatives technique. Theproposed hybrid design aim was to ensure that the two algorithmscomplement each other by effectively exploring and exploitingthe problem search space. Experimental results justify that anadept hybridization of evolutionary algorithms with a suitablelocal search method could yield a robust and efficient means ofsolving wide range of global optimization problems." ],

The data allow for a precise and independent determination of the projected spin-orbit angle of this system: λ = 10[° over .]0 ± 5[° over .]1. This result supersedes the previous claim of λ = 62° ± 25° by Narita et al., which was based on lower-precision data with poor statistics. Thus the stellar spin and planetary orbital axes of the HD 17156 system are likely to be well-aligned, despite the planet's large orbital eccentricity suggesting a history of strong dynamical interactions." ],

It is based on the 2nd EMEA edition and the 11th United States (US) edition. The US editions have a distinguished history and deservedly high reputation for clarity and soundness of approach, and we maintained the presentation style and readability of those editions in preparing the international edition. We have replaced many of the US-based exam-ples, case studies and exercises with equally interesting and appropriate ones sourced from a wider geographical base, particularly the UK, Ireland, continental Europe, South Africa and the Middle East. We have also streamlined the book by moving four non-mandatory chapters, the software section, and exercise answers to the associated online platform. Other notable changes in this third EMEA edition are summarized here.\nChanges in the 3rd EMEA Edition\n•\tSoftware sections In the 2nd international edition, we have updated the soft-ware sections to provide step-by-step instructions for the latest versions of the software packages: Minitab 15, PASW 17 and Microsoft® Office EXCEL 2007. The software sections have been relocated at the end of chapters, as in the US editions.\n•\tSelf-test exercises Certain exercises are identified as self-test exercises. Com-pletely worked-out solutions for those exercises are provided  on the online platform that accompanies the text. Students can attempt the self-test exercises and immediately check the solution to evaluate their understanding of the con-cepts presented in the chapter.\n•\tOther Content Revisions The following additional content revisions appear in the new edition.\no\tNew examples of times series data are provided in Chapter 1.\no\tChapter 9 contains a revised introduction to hypothesis testing, with a better set of guidelines for identifying the null and alternative hypothe-ses.\no\tChapter 13 makes much more explicit, the linkage between Analysis of Variance and experimental design.\no\tChapter 17 now includes coverage of the popular Holt’s linear expo-nential smoothing methodology. \no\tThe treatment of non-parametric methods in Chapter 18 has been re-vised and updated.\no\tChapter  19 on index numbers(on the online platform) has been up-dated with current index numbers.\no\tA number of  case problems have been added or updated. These are in the chapters on Descriptive Statistics, Discrete Probability Distribu-tions, Inferences about Population Variances, Tests of Goodness of Fit and Independence, Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Regression, Regression Analysis:Model Building, Non-Parametric Methods, Index Numbers and Decision Analysis. These case problems provide students with the opportunity to analyze somewhat larger data sets and prepare managerial reports based on the results of the analysis.\no\tEach chapter begins with a Statistics in Practice article that describes an application of the statistical methodology to be covered in the chap-ter. New to this edition are Statistics in Practice articles for Chapters 2,  9, 10 and 11, with several other articles substantially updated and re-vised for this new edition.\no\tNew examples and exercises have been added throughout the book, based on real data and recent reference sources of statistical informa-tion. We believe that the use of real data helps generate more student interest in the material and enables the student to learn about both the statistical methodology and its application.\no\tTo accompany the new exercises and examples, data files are available on the  online platform. The data sets are available in Minitab,  SPSS and EXCEL formats. Data set logos are used in the text to identify the data sets that are available on the online platform. Data sets for all case problems as well as data sets for larger exercises are included." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Erschriebene Religion : die Vielfalt der Stimmen in den Religionserzählungen des modernen Durchbruchs", "The article provides a case study on the impact of literary tendencies on the conception of religion. In the nineteenth century, “religion” became a critical term in various academic disciplines, with different concepts of religion emphasizing its subjective-emotional character (in the line of German Protestantism), its social impact (in the line of French sociological schools), its cognitive function (in the line of the evolutionists in Great Britain), and—as a general tendency—its historical character. In the Scandinavian intellectual scene, intensely monitoring the academic developments in the larger countries, syntheses between these approaches and domains attributed to religion were attempted relatively early on. In the study of the European history of religion, it had long been emphasized that this “scientification” of the concept of religion had an eminent impact on the religious field, leading to new forms of spirituality, religious identities, as well as interreligious dialogue and discourse—which, in turn, influenced academia. The main thesis of this article is that popular literature served as an important catalyst in these dynamics. By concretizing abstract theories of religion in the form of narratives, different types of religious behavior, experiences, and social functions were connected with specific literary characters and plots. The poetic constraints and possibilities of the narrative genres thus, in turn, re-shaped the conception of religion. The Scandinavian “modern breakthrough,” as it had been declared by Georg Brandes in the 1870s, identified “religion” as one of the basic “problems” to be debated in contemporary literature. In the late 1870s and the 1880s, both Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and Arne Garborg were intensely involved in this debate, often misunderstood as a personal “religious crisis.” Their literary works document the development of a unique characteristic of the era. While the “voice of the 1870s and the 1880s, both Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and Arne Garborg were intensely involved in this debate, often misunderstood as a personal “religious crisis.” Their literary works document thedevelopment of a unique characteristic of the era. While the “voice of the modern breakthrough” is distinct in their earlier works of this period, with enlightened, free-thinking protagonists standing opposed to a powerful and dogmatic Christian society, the focus soon shifts to a new problem area: what is meant by the term “religion” and which domain it belongs to. Influenced by literary naturalism and experimenting with new narrative techniques, the sociological perspective soon shifted to more psychological accounts. While historicizing religion and commenting oncontemporary theories of religion, the writers cultivated new modes of religious speech and identity. Detaching God from religion and suggesting it as a human phenomenon, they allowed for a re-evaluation of the concept of religion and prepared for new non-traditional forms of religiosity." ],

The same level of design quality has not been applied to the design of prefabricated school buildings. As CADCAM technology becomes more prevalent within the construction industry and greener, smarter materials are developed, new opportunities arise in the design of learning spaces. What can be learnt from bespoke prefabrication techniques being developed in other industries and overseas in order to advance the design and delivery of learning spaces within Australia?</p>\n<p>\nThis research investigates whether industrial design methodologies might be strategically adopted into architectural design in order to incorporate mass production techniques. Learning environments need to be designed to be environmentally efficient, place specific and better suited to user needs. By including both macro and micro oriented scenarios, the research aims to clarify the challenges for using prefabrication in the design of learning environments.   </p>\n<p>\nWhile this ambitious research is in its infancy, the complex framework and support from industry is relevant for other researchers who are seeking to have an impact on design practice using an action research methodology. The research is timely. Following in the footsteps of the United Kingdom, Australian state and federal governments have committed to reinvigorate our aging school stock. This research led by an interdisciplinary team is being developed in partnership with Departments of Education in three Australian states. The aim is to align designers with experts in prefabricated construction and delivery. </p>\n<p>\nThe research proposal is positioned within current knowledge as demonstrated through a literature review.

In-depth longitudinal exploration of lung cancer patients' symptom experiences is used to examine patient symptom experiences and distress across the disease trajectory of lung cancer. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients and their primary caregivers at four time points: at the beginning of treatment and then subsequently at three, six, and twelve months. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was employed in the data analysis. FINDINGS: Findings indicate that a cluster of interacting respiratory symptoms play a central role in patients' symptom experiences within the lung cancer population. The interviews also suggest that symptoms such as cough which are under-represented in research within this population may play an important role in patients' symptom experiences. DISCUSSION: Longitudinal qualitative investigation offers a valuable method for improving our understanding of patients' experiences of lung cancer and for identifying potential opportunities to improve patient quality of life." ],

  "texts" : [ "Persistent systemic inflammation is associated with poor clinical outcomes in COPD: a novel phenotype.", "BACKGROUND: Because chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous condition, the identification of specific clinical phenotypes is key to developing more effective therapies. To explore if the persistence of systemic inflammation is associated with poor clinical outcomes in COPD we assessed patients recruited to the well-characterized ECLIPSE cohort (NCT00292552). METHODS AND FINDINGS: Six inflammatory biomarkers in peripheral blood (white blood cells (WBC) count and CRP, IL-6, IL-8, fibrinogen and TNF-α levels) were quantified in 1,755 COPD patients, 297 smokers with normal spirometry and 202 non-smoker controls that were followed-up for three years. We found that, at baseline, 30% of COPD patients did not show evidence of systemic inflammation whereas 16% had persistent systemic inflammation. Even though pulmonary abnormalities were similar in these two groups, persistently inflamed patients during follow-up had significantly increased all-cause mortality (13% vs. 2%, p<0.001) and exacerbation frequency (1.5 (1.5) vs. 0.9 (1.1) per year, p<0.001) compared to non-inflamed ones. As a descriptive study our results show associations but do not prove causality. Besides this, the inflammatory response is complex and we studied only a limited panel of biomarkers, albeit they are those investigated by the majority of previous studies and are often and easily measured in clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results identify a novel systemic inflammatory COPD phenotype that may be the target of specific research and treatment." ],

  "texts" : [ "Comprehensive assessment of rheumatoid arthritis susceptibility loci in a large psoriatic arthritis cohort.", "OBJECTIVE: A number of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) susceptibility genes have been identified in recent years. Given the overlap in phenotypic expression of synovial joint inflammation between RA and psoriatic arthritis (PsA), the authors explored whether RA susceptibility genes are also associated with PsA. METHODS: 56 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mapping to 41 genes previously reported as RA susceptibility loci were selected for investigation. PsA was defined as an inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis and subjects were recruited from the UK and Ireland. Genotyping was performed using the Sequenom MassArray platform and frequencies compared with data derived from large UK control collections. RESULTS: Significant evidence for association with susceptibility to PsA was found toa SNP mapping to the REL (rs13017599, p(trend)=5.2×10(4)) gene, while nominal evidence for association (p(trend)<0.05) was found to seven other loci including PLCL2 (rs4535211, p=1.7×10(-3)); STAT4 (rs10181656, p=3.0×10(-3)) and the AFF3, CD28, CCL21, IL2 and KIF5A loci. Interestingly, three SNPs demonstrated opposite effects to those reported for RA. CONCLUSIONS: The REL gene, a key modulator of the NFκB pathway, is associated with PsA but the allele conferring risk to RA is protective in PsA suggesting that there are fundamental differences in the aetiological mechanisms underlying these two types of inflammatory arthritis." ],

  "title" : "Mixed Matrix Membranes of a Polymer of Intrinsic Microporosity with Crystalline Porous Solids",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Mixed Matrix Membranes of a Polymer of Intrinsic Microporosity with Crystalline Porous Solids", "This work explores the fabrication and permeability testing of mixed matrix membranes (MMM) utilising a polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM-1) and various fillers. PIM-1 has been chosen for this work due to its high apparent surface area and high sorption of gases. PIM-1 also is a good candidate for gas sorption applications due to the film forming properties of the polymer. The fillers utilised in this work are Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and organic cages, which have been chosen due to the gas sorption properties they exhibit. The MOFs used are micro and nanoparticles of Zeolitic Imidazole Framework-8 (ZIF-8), copper based MOF HKUST-1 and chromium based MOF MIL-101. Micro particles of magnesium based MOF Mg-MOF-74 were also looked at as well as cage 3, nano cage 3 and reduced cage 3. Comparable surface areas of the MOFs compared to those quoted in the literature have been obtained. Successful PIM-1/Filler MMMs were synthesised utilising PIM-1 and the fillers outlined above with various loadings of filler. The highest loading achieved was with a 10:6.4 PIM-1/nanoZIF-8 ratio. All MMMs apart from PIM-1/Mg-MOF-74 MMM were homogenous on a macroscale with scanning electron microscopy proving the dispersion of fillers.  Gas transport properties of the MMMs were determined using predominantly a time lag method. PIM-1/ZIF-8 MMMs were also tested using a chromatographic method and using a gas sorption experiment. A range of gases were tested including CO2, N2, CH4, O2, He and H2.  Ideal selectivities were also calculated with focus on the gas pairs O2/N2, CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2.When comparing the two permeability methods using the PIM-1/nanoZIF-8 MMM, lower permeability results were found from the time lag method. This was concluded to be due to the aging effect brought about by the vacuum used in the time lag method. The chromatographic method produced positive results with high selectivities, breaking Robeson’s upper bound, for the gas pair O2/N2. All other fillers tested showed an increase in permeability and stable selectivity with an increase in the amount of filler. MIL-101 and Cage 3 were the most successful fillers with high permeabilities of 35600 and 37400 Barrer respectively, encroaching on that of PTMSP. Mg-MOF-74 and reduced cage 3 MMM however, had a detrimental effect on the permeability. Aging data was also investigated which showed that for the majority of MMM the permeability followed the trend of PIM-1. microHKUST-1 and cage 3 of 10:3 loading were shown to give promising results with 10000 and 14300 Barrer respectively compared to 7200 Barrer for PIM-1. Although a loss in permeability is seen, it is still above that of PIM-1 at the same point of aging. These results give a positive indication that MMMs have the potential to provide resistance against aging, a major problem in using high free volume polymers in industrial applications." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Solubilisation of tomato fruit pectins by ascorbate: a possible non-enzymic mechanism of fruit softening.", "The aim of this work was to test the hypothesis that endogenous ascorbate, released into the apoplast by membrane permeabilisation early in fruit ripening, could promote the solubilisation and depolymerisation of polysaccharides, and thus contribute to fruit softening. In vitro, ascorbate (1 mM), especially in the presence of traces of either Cu2+ or H2O2, solubilised up to 40% of the total pectin from the alcohol-insoluble residue of mature-green tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) fruit. Solubilisation was due to the action of ascorbate-generated hydroxyl radicals (*OH), which can cause non-enzymic scission of polysaccharides. The pectins solubilised by ascorbate in vitro were polydisperse (4-1,000 kDa), partially esterified and galactose-rich. Excised pieces of living tomato fruit released ascorbate into the medium (apoplast); the ability of different tissues to do this increased in the order pericarp < placenta < locule. In all three tissues, but especially in the locule, the ability to release ascorbate increased during ripening. The Cu content of each tissue also increased during ripening, whereas neither Fe nor Mn showed a similar trend. We suggest that progressively increasing levels of Cu and ascorbate in the fruit apoplast would lead to elevated *OH production there and thus to non-enzymic scission of pectins during ripening. Such scission could contribute to the natural softening of the fruit. De-esterified citrus pectin was more susceptible to ascorbate-induced scission in vitro than methylesterified pectin, suggesting a possible new significance for pectin methylesterase activity in fruit ripening. In conclusion, non-enzymic mechanisms of fruit softening should be considered alongside the probable roles of hydrolases, xyloglucan endotransglucosylases and expansins." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Impact on mortality and cancer incidence rates of using random invitation from population registers for recruitment to trials.", "BACKGROUND: Participants in trials evaluating preventive interventions such as screening are on average healthier than the general population. To decrease this 'healthy volunteer effect' (HVE) women were randomly invited from population registers to participate in the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) and not allowed to self refer. This report assesses the extent of the HVE still prevalent in UKCTOCS and considers how certain shortfalls in mortality and incidence can be related to differences in socioeconomic status. METHODS: Between 2001 and 2005, 202 638 postmenopausal women joined the trial out of 1 243 312 women randomly invited from local health authority registers. The cohort was flagged for deaths and cancer registrations and mean follow up at censoring was 5.55 years for mortality, and 2.58 years for cancer incidence. Overall and cause-specific Standardised Mortality Ratios (SMRs) and Standardised Incidence Ratios (SIRs) were calculated based on national mortality (2005) and cancer incidence (2006) statistics. The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD 2007) was used to assess the link between socioeconomic status and mortality/cancer incidence, and differences between the invited and recruited populations. RESULTS: The SMR for all trial participants was 37%. By subgroup, the SMRs were higher for: younger age groups, extremes of BMI distribution and with each increasing year in trial. There was a clear trend between lower socioeconomic status and increased mortality but less pronounced with incidence. While the invited population had higher mean IMD scores (more deprived) than the national average, those who joined the trial were less deprived. CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment to screening trials through invitation from population registers does not prevent a pronounced HVE on mortality. The impact on cancer incidence is much smaller. Similar shortfalls can be expected in other screening RCTs and it maybe prudent to use the various mortality and incidence rates presented as guides for calculating event rates and power in RCTs involving women." ],

The paper is organised in six sections:\nI. Existing US BITs\nII. China’s current BITs with other countries\nIII. The potential US-China BIT\nIV. Major regulatory and transparency issues\nV. Implications for the US economy\nVI. Interviews\nSimply defined, a BIT is a treaty between two countries designed to promote and protect investments between the two signatory states. A BIT provides investors with a safer and more transparent investment environment by guarding against the risk of expropriation by the host state. Many countries, especially the larger economies, sign BITs with their main trading partners, both to ensure that companies from their country receive proper protection when they make investments abroad and to ensure that their rights can be protected and enforced through binding international arbitration." ],

OBJECTIVE: To further assess how patients with a positive initial response to infliximab respond to 1 year of continuous infliximab treatment. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients with moderate-to-severe plaque and nail psoriasis who initiated and continued infliximab treatment up to week 46 was conducted. RESULTS: Among all nail psoriasis patients receiving 1 year of infliximab (n = 186), 74.6 and 54.1% achieved at least 75 or 90% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) at week 50. These PASI-75 (n = 138) and PASI-90 (n = 100) responders had respective mean improvements from baseline to week 50 of 93.6 and 97.3% for the PASI, 90.6 and 94.1% for the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and 78.2 and 80.3% for the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI).

It discusses the evolution of the project, focusing on the ways in which patient narratives were constructed, the purposes they served, and the responses of professionals to the narratives in subsequent workshops. Along the way, the paper reflects on the responses of patients that problematise the notion of \"patient-centred\" care.

Results showed that, after 1 month, fat intake, saturated fat intake, and the proportion of energy derived from fat decreased significantly in the experimental group but not in the control group.

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "ISLAM AND THE CHANGING MEANING OF SPIRITUALITAS AND SPIRITUAL IN CONTEMPORARY INDONESIA", "Spiritualitas, an Indonesian term derived from English word’s spirituality, and spiritual from English’s spiritual, are now commonly used in Indonesian discourses. This paper traces earliest usages of the term spiritualitas and spiritual and then explores their changing meaning in contemporary Indonesia. Unlike in the past, where Indonesian government broadly used the terms to refer indigenous mystical legacies of the Aliran Kepercayaan or Kebatinan designing them as not religion but merely cultural legacy (adat, budaya spiritual), the current usage of the terms indicates a growing trend of Indonesian world religions, mainly Islam, in absorbing and acquiring the terms as kind of religious expressions. This trend is quite different from that happen in the West; while the growing of spirituality is correlated to the declining of Western affiliation and participation in religion, mainly Christianity; in Indonesia, world religions, especially Islam, seem to be the sponsor of spirituality. Thus, instead of spirituality will silently take over religion as predicted by Jaremy Carrette and Richard King (2005), the mainstream religious groups seem to take over spirituality. <br />[Istilah spiritual dan spiritulitas akhir-akhir ini banyak digunakan di Indonesia, merujuk tidak hanya pada ekspresi spiritual di luar agama, namun juga yang ada dalam tradsi keagaamaan. Tulisan ini menelaah awal mula penggunaan istilah spiritual dan spiritualitas dalam khazanah literatur pasca kemerdekaan serta fase-fase perubahan makna dari istilah tersebut pada masa-masa sesudahnya. Pada fase awal, pemerintah Indonesia secara massif menggunakan istilah spiritual untuk menunjuk tradisi keberagamaan di luar agama-agama resmi yang berbasis pada mistisisme agama-agama lokal seperti Aliran Kepercayaan dan Kebatinan. Hal ini mengisyaratkan bahwa istilah spiritual tersebut digunakan untuk menekankan bahwa tradisi beragamaan lokal tersebut bukan agama, hanya warisan budaya atau adat istiadat. Namun, kecenderangan baru sejak akhir 1990an hingga saat ini menunjukkan bahwa agama-agama resmi, terutama Islam, secara massif telah menggunakan istilah spiritual maupun spiritualitas sebagai padanan dari ekspresi batin keberagamaan (inner religious expression). Trend semacam ini cukup unik bila dibandingkan dengan yang terjadi di Barat, sebab tumbuh suburnya gerakan spiritual di Barat terjadi pada saat menurunnya tingkat afiliasi publik terhadap agama-agama besar, terutama Kristen; sedangkan di Indonesia agama-agama besar dunia, terutama Islam, menjadi sponsor utama populernya istilah spiritual dan spiritualitas serta munculnya gerakan-gerakan spiritual berbasis agama. Oleh karena itu, prediksi Jaremy Carrete dan Richard King yang menyatakan “pengambil alihan peran agama oleh spiritualitas” sebagaimana yang terjadi di dunia Barat, tidak terjadi di Indonesia. Sebaliknya, yang terjadi di Indonesia adalah agama-agama besar dunia telah mengambil alih peran dan fungsi spiritualitas." ],

One of the recent changes in the delivery of projects has been to task a smaller number of staff dedicated to the supervision of third year projects. Balancing the increased demand on staff supervising third year individual projects with increasing the quality of supervision has prompted us to change the delivery mode of third year projects. One of the main initiatives is to group individual projects under a 'theme' that will offer places for approximately six to ten students working under the supervision of an academic member of staff usually with assistance of a research group member. Although students still perform an individual piece of work they benefit from joint training on (for example) software tools, the use of equipment, key techniques and higher levels of peer support." ],

  "texts" : [ "Using the theory of planned behaviour to understand binge drinking: the importance of beliefs for developing interventions.", "OBJECTIVES: To elicit students' salient beliefs in relation to binge drinking, and to examine the extent to which individual salient beliefs predict theory of planned behaviour (TPB) constructs in relation to binge drink, and actual drinking behaviour assessed later that evening. DESIGN: Longitudinal, over a single evening. METHODS: 192 students were recruited as they entered a campus bar at the beginning of the evening. They completed questionnaires with open-ended questions eliciting beliefs concerning binge drinking, and ratings scales assessing standard TPB constructs in relation to binge drinking. At the end of the evening, 181 completed a second questionnaire and recorded the number of alcoholic drinks they had consumed. RESULTS: Beliefs were reliably coded (all kappas ≥0.79). Students with higher intentions to binge drink were more likely to believe that their friends approved of binge drinking, and that (lack of) money would make it difficult. Students who reported drinking more alcohol at the end of the evening were more likely to believe that getting drunk is an advantage/what they would like about binge drinking tonight, that their sports teams would approve, and that celebrating, drinking patterns, and environment would make it easy to binge drink. CONCLUSIONS: The present study has identified the individually salient beliefs relating to drinking behaviour that the TPB states should be addressed by interventions to alter behaviour, and which that should be assessed as mediators in intervention research. As a whole, these findings highlight the importance of perceived peer norms in binge drinking in this population, and support the idea of interventions to challenge the perception of social pressure to binge drink." ],

The challenges of organising transition from paediatric to adult care in endocrinology are recognised. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether young people with CAH have been successfully transitioned from paediatric care to specialist adult services and the influence of the introduction of a Young Person Clinic (YPC) where the young person is introduced to the adult endocrinologist. DESIGN, PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: Patients aged 16+ years with CAH who had attended the adrenal clinic at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital between 1992 and 2009 were identified. Clinical information, attendance data in paediatric and adult services were obtained from patient records and the electronic appointment system. RESULTS: 61 patients (27 male) were identified. 36 patients were referred to specialist adult services from the paediatric service, 18 of these (50%) were lost to follow up (2 were never offered an appointment). Only 53% of the whole group attended their first new and subsequent second appointment (i.e. good early attenders). There was no difference in engagement with adult services in those who transitioned through the YPC. Good early attenders were less likely to get lost to follow up compared with poor early attenders (11-33% lost to follow up compared with 63-71%). CONCLUSIONS: Half of all young people with CAH referred to specialist adult services are no longer attending. Introducing the adult endocrinologist prior to transfer had no positive effect on engagement with adult services. Attendance at the first two appointments in the adult services should be seen as an indicator of \"reasonable\" engagement. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd." ],

Most research that is done about spirituality is principally qualitative in which phenomenological rapprochements and story narration are used. Goal: The goal of the specific research is the study of the qualitative features which came from the use of the questionnaire: “The Royal Free Interview for Religious and Spiritual Beliefs” in a general population of Thessaly. Material and Methodology: 393 citizens of Thessaly completed the questionnaire “The Royal Free Interview for Religious and Spiritual Beliefs” which occupies with religious and spiritual beliefs. Results: Having 393 participants, 149 (37,9%) were men and 244 (62,1%) were women. The majority of the women (N= 161,66%) stated that they have equally religious and spiritual beliefs compared to 44,9% of the men. A lot of the participants connected their beliefs to issues concerning their health state while others stated that their lives are interwoven with the meaning of the Orthodox religion and the way that their religion is believed: “Believing in the Orthodox religion, in a great degree, and critical observation and belief to the ecclesiastical way of life. Others divide spirituality and religiosity. Spirituality has to do with the prospects- the point of view of each person.” Some participants showed supernatural concerns while we are impressed by the percentage of people who stated that they have lived an intense experience which brought a new, deeper meaning to their lives. They also stated that they felt that they were unified with the world or the universe. 58 participants occupied in describing their experience. Conclusion: The results which came out from their qualitative features of the specific questionnaire are very useful. First of all, there is connection between spirituality and health, while 110 people tried to describe their afterlife state" ],

The purpose of the article is to study the matter of investment in fixed capital of Ukraines enterprises as a basis of country innovation development and to determine the role of fixed capital investments in innovative development providing.The results of the analysis. In the article the structure and the volume of foreign investments attracting to the national economy of Ukraine during 2003-2012 are analyzed. It is determined that in spite of annual positive foreign investments volume growth in compare to the previous year the dynamic shows the investment climate deterioration because of the investment runoff. The determined trends show the problem in providing a countrys sunstainable economic development in the innovative aspect. The basis of the countrys innovative development is the investment activation into the enterprises fixed capital. The economic activity of the subjects of economy and the level of their competitiveness in domestic and foreign markets are determined by the essential level of fixed capital funds. They are the basis of the enterprise productive process. According to the analysis Ukrainian enterprises have a high level of fixed capital consumption. The rate of investments aimed to renovate fixed capital is too small. The volumes of fixed capital funds renovation and reproduction financing at the domestic enterprises reduced according to the reduction production volume and joint profits. The main source of fixed capital funds reproduction at the industrial enterprises of Ukraine is the main financial assets of the enterprise. The catastrophic lack of internal and external funds was the reason why heads of enterprises refused to implement new innovative projects and carry out all required actions on calling in accumulated credit obligations to the counteragents.Investment increasing will make it possible to renew enterprises fixed capital funds, to reorganize the coproduction and to balance the development of national economy. They promote to create required industrys raw material base, to accelerate the scientific and technical progress, to the production quality, to develope new product markets.The financing of the innovation and investment activity can be both at domestic cost and at foreign investors cost. Though nowadays the volumes of foreign investments are too small because of tense economic and political situation. The structure of investment sources in includes: enterprise own financial funds, borrowed money, raised money and allocation. At the present stage of national economy development the innovation and investment processes of industrial enterprises have inertial characteristics because of accumulated internal and external problems existing for many years. We should direct the domestic science and technical potential to provide the needs of the economic innovation development of Ukraine and to organize hi-tech production. Also it is necessary to develop and implement the means of government support in innovative activity, to increase the budget financing in enterprises innovative activity.In spite of real gross domestic product increase in 2010 and improvement of internal and external market conditions the private and state sectors decreased the investments into the productive capacity extension. The law rate of investments into the fixed capital is to be a threat for further economy renewal because the third part of the investments is in operations in the current year, and the other two-thirds of investments is in next year operations. So it is impossible in medium-term prospect to fasten the development of Ukraine economy.Conclusions and directions of further researches. Consequently, the investment matter directed on enterprises fixed capital funds renewal is a key matter in the problem-solving of Ukrainian industry innovation development activation. The further research trends are the development of methods to choice the appropriate structure of Ukrainian enterprises investment resources" ],

  "texts" : [ "Authorities/Knowledge/Beliefs/Outcomes: ‘Governing’ in the Profession of Graphic Design in the US", "<p>This exploratory research examines an under-evaluated aspect of graphic design in the United States: the nature of the profession. Discourse analysis that applies the theory of governmentality is used to assess previously collected, open-ended interviews with graphic designers, as well as other source material. Based on the late work of Michel Foucault, governmentality considers how authorities govern through the creation and dissemination of knowledge, which works through individuals’ desires and beliefs and leads to unpredictable outcomes. In this research, two ‘authorities’ within the graphic design profession are identified and considered – design competitions and graphic design higher education. Both authorities are loose and heterogeneous, spread across many organizations, locations, and individuals. These authorities govern through the creation and production of knowledge about what graphic design is and how to practice it. Governing is evidenced in documents, on Web sites, in education accreditation materials, and via practitioners’ and educators’ discourse. Governing works through practitioners’, educators’, and students’ desires to have their work validated by their peers, instructors, critics, judges, and the profession. The outcomes of this governing are varied. Practitioners accepted the awards, found external venues for validation, and questioned the structure and nature of the competitions. Educators questioned the composition and premise of graphic design education and shared knowledge about classroom policies. Practitioners questioned the definition of graphic design and its practice learned during schooling. Thus, the theory of governmentality is a tool for illuminating how the graphic design profession in the US governs. This exploratory analysis opens up new questions for graphic design research, education, and practice.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Keywords:</strong> <br />\nGraphic Design, Governmentality, Governing, Profession, Design Competitions, Education</p>" ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Historical Transformations of Pedagogic Practice: a Socio-cultural and Activity Theory Analysis of Preparation for Work in Russian Schools", "This thesis investigates how students are prepared for work in schools in the context of post-communism in Russia. It aims to gain an understanding of what theories and processes constitute preparation for work in Russian schools. In the light of how they have changed as a result of the fall of communism in 1991, the thesis seeks to explore the ways in which students are prepared to enter the world of work. The socio-cultural and activity theory is employed to explore the relationship between students’ engagement in pedagogic practices and macro historical transformations in Russia that have affected it. The methodology includes a documentary analysis of teacher-training textbooks, which were used in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s and a case study of preparation for work in a secondary school in Perm, Russia, which involved a group of thirty teachers and thirty students. Biographical interviews were conducted with thirty individuals who lived through the economic and social transformations caused by the events of 1991. The analysis of the data demonstrates that preparation for work in Russian schools is a combination of two pedagogic processes – vospitanie, which refers to the overall up-bringing of children, and ‘professional orientation’, which provides career guidance. The literature review and documentary analysis have revealed that the events of 1991 have influenced the ideological underpinning of vospitanie and professional orientation, especially in terms of humanisation of pedagogic processes. However, with regard to the conceptual framework, vospitanie and professional orientation have remained relatively intact. These pedagogic concepts emphasise a dialogic relationship between students and teachers. The case study analysis shows that the teachers’ conceptualisation of vospitanie and professional orientation reflect the findings from the documentary analysis, but the teachers have interpreted the theory in the ways that reflect their various, historically formed views of preparation for work. Some of these views, expressed by the teachers who were trained in the Soviet time, do not support the new humanistic approach advocated in the literature; instead, the focus is on differentiation by ability and on academic achievement. Combined with the fact that the case study school does not offer practical vocational experience, this provides some explanation of why only those students who receive support from outside the school are better prepared than others to overcome the challenges of the new market economy. Those students who do not receive relevant support outside the school are developing dispositions towards employment, which are less likely to help them progress in the context of the market economy." ],

  "title" : "Drive tourism: a view from the road",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Drive tourism: a view from the road", "[Extract] The nature of self-drive tourism is changing globally. In countries where privately owned vehicles have long been a popular choice of tourism transport, increased access to low-cost airfares and increased costs of vehicle\r\nmaintenance and fuel have been critical influences. Holyoak et al. (2009) documented the shift in Australia, for example, from a market dominated by tourists 'in transit' - using the vehicle simply as the most convenient mode of transport between the origin and the destination - to one where the use of the vehicle was more central to the enjoyment of the trip as a whole. Consequently, self-drive tourism research is now beginning to pay more attention to four-wheel-drive travel (Taylor and Carson, this volume,\r\nChapter 17; Prideaux and Coghlan, this volume, Chapter 18), caravanning (van Heerden, this volume, Chapter 6; McClymont et al., this volume, Chapter 16), motorcycling (Walker, this volume, Chapter 12) and other subsets of the market where the vehicle itself is embraced as a core attribute\r\nof the tourism experience, rather than as a necessary evil of transport. In countries where vehicle ownership is only now becoming widespread (Yu et aI., this volume, Chapter 8; du Cros and Ong, this volume, Chapter 9, which highlight the case of China), whole new types of tourism experiences\r\nare being made possible, free from the constraints of scheduled mass transit. The use of the vehicle as conspicuous consumption reflects the rise of new middle classes who want to purchase tourism as part of a confirmation of their new place in a wider world than they previously accessed. It must also be noted that in a number of markets, including China, India, Eastern Europe and South America, self-drive tourism has emerged after the development of low-cost air travel. The development of the self-drive market in these countries will not take the same path as in North America, Europe and Australasia, where the mass ownership of cars pre-dated access to low-cost air travel. Our thesis is that the major change in the global self-drive markets is a shift away from the car as a form of least-cost transport towards the use of a variety of self-driven vehicles that add value to the tourism experience. This book has documented the meaning of that fundamental change in the marketplace from the perspective of the tourist. Chapters have documented what it now means to be a drive tourist in China, a four-wheel-driver\r\nin Australia, a motorcyclist in the UK, a motorhome driver in the US, an international self-driver in Brazil, and so on. There have also been reflections on what the global markets and emerging trends mean for the tourism\r\nindustry - rental car companies in New Zealand, motoring associations, marketers of touring routes and other drive destinations, or emergency services agencies. In this chapter, we use the 'Grand Tour' (Olsen 2002) of Central and Eastern Australia to illustrate the challenges facing destinations and businesses in adjusting to new market dynamics and to synthesise issues raised throughout the book." ],

  "texts" : [ "Mitos cristianos en la poesía no religiosa del Grupo del 27", "The exploration of Christian myths as literary resources in the work of Spanish poets writing between 1920 and 1944 has to date been attempted by scholars focusing on the works of individual poets, notably Luis Cernuda and Lorca. In this doctoral thesis, I aim to cover one of the few gaps in the criticism of this period by pointing to the use of Christian myths by a range of poets working with a similar intention, and within a common heritage.The Christian myths that I shall examine here, are approached in two different ways: firstly structurally, analysing them as Biblical references and fragments of myths –using Strauss’ nomenclature ‘Gross Constituent Units’—which appear decontextualised in many of the works, with a non-religious intention, that is, as ametaphor for something else. Secondly, thematically, by suggesting that there arefour mythic topics common to many of the poets writing at those times, which are:creation by means of the word; the loss of Paradise; suffering; and the announcement of a new world to come. Through these myths, the poets reflect an evolution in their lives and Poetics. A phenomenological perspective is adopted in order to explain the role of the myths in the poems and to trace common grounds through the myth among the poets and as continuators of a Western poetic tradition since Romanticism (Prieto de Paula, 2002:59).The story line that these four topics constitute is very similar to the Romantic plot that M. H. Abrams had defined for the British Romantics and that Philip Silver and Derek Harris had already applied to the poetry of Luis Cernuda. This mirroring of the myth in the British and German Romantics has led the thesis towards a contextualisation of the work of the poets of 1927 in the modern Western literary tradition .They are seen in this specific context of practice as inheritors of a line which goes from European Romanticism, through the Modernism, Symbolism, Pure Poetry, and Avant-garde to the group of 1927, and therefore they are expressing typically modern topics by means of Religious images and myths. As well as those conventionally studied as belonging to the “Generación del veintisiete”, the thesis discusses Ernestina de Champourcin, Elisabeth Mulder, Lucía Sánchez Saornil, Ana María Martínez Sagi and Rosa Chacel, and proposes a new way of seeing the group of poets writing between the 20s and the Civil war and after this in the exile as a new expression of the same modernity." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "A new approach to modelling process and building energy flows in manufacturing industry.", "Global conservation of energy and material has become a key topic among governments, businesses, local societies and academics. A point made by many on the subject of energy begin by stating the importance of conserving the earth’s natural resources, and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a bid to reduce global warming. This research is no exception, concentrating on an energy and material intensive sector of the global economy; manufacturing industry. \r\n\r\nThis research formulates a methodology for modelling energy flows between a factory building, its manufacturing process systems and the materials used. The need for such an approach arises from the gap in knowledge between the understanding of energy consumed by factory buildings and process systems in manufacturing industry. Factory buildings are purpose built environments that house manufacturing processes, manufacturing plant, materials and occupants. Modern production lines are designed to optimise the flow of materials throughout a factory; to and from storage, production, assembly and distribution. Manufacturing production systems dictate the shape and size of factory buildings. This can lead to a high proportion of the overall energy consumption to be attributed to building services. The coupling of factory energy flows assists energy managers at both the facility and process levels, in order to identify efficiency improvements and reduce energy use and associated carbon emissions. A better understanding of the overall energy balance of a factory environment will allow energy to be used in a more sustainable manner.\r\n\r\nSimulation tools are widely used in the disciplines of building design and manufacturing systems engineering. Traditional building energy flow paths are well documented and are handled within dynamic building modelling tools. Globally, manufacturing activities cover a wide field of industrial practice and use a range of simulation software packages such as flow diagramming packages, computational fluid dynamics, discrete event tools, direct coding, optimisation tools etc. The increasing use of simulation makes it difficult for a manufacturing systems analyst to choose a suitable approach for energy modelling. An important aspect of the methodology described in this thesis is the coupling of energy flows that occur internally (within a factory boundary) and externally (outside a factory boundary e.g. weather) in relation to time and location within and around a factory environment. Building modelling tools provide a structured and well defined approach to monitoring energy flows within traditional built environments. \r\n\r\nThe methodology extends the framework of an existing building modelling tool; the International Building Physics Toolbox (IBPT), to include the simulation of manufacturing process systems and material flow within a factory. There is a wide range of manufacturing processes used in industry so the scope of this research is reduced to thermal and electrical processes only. A thermal process is considered to be an extension of a thermal zone (such as a room), as defined in building modelling tools. Two thermal processes are considered; processes that act on a volume of gas (i.e. air) and those that act on a volume of liquid. Material flow is represented in the model by time series. The lumped capacitance method is used to approximate the change in surface temperature of a material in relation to its stored energy, long wave radiation between the material and its surroundings, and convective heat transfer. To validate the use of the IBPT algorithms to model building physics, the results derived by using the IBPT are compared with those derived by using an industry standard trusted building modelling tool called ‘Integrated Environmental Solutions Virtual Environment’ (IES VE), in comparable areas of building modelling. \r\n\r\nThree industrial case studies have been analysed, and these represent real scenarios from the automotive and aerospace manufacturing industry sectors. Two out of the three case studies include the simulation of the building (fabric and heating system), material flow and manufacturing process systems (air and liquid based). The third case study focuses on process modelling only, with future scope to include the factory building. Data obtained from industrial practice is used to validate the results of energy modelling using the proposed method. Results from the case studies demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed method of modelling factory energy flows and associated energy consumption at both facility and process level. Opportunities to reduce energy use and associated carbon emissions are also identified.\r\n\r\nThe methodology does have some limitations in the form of the number of manufacturing process types represented and the complex nature of modelling real energy flows that occur within factory buildings. However the findings of the research show that an integrated approach to modelling factory energy flows through development of a building modelling framework has real benefits for manufacturing industry. These benefits are very unlikely to be realised by modelling processes and buildings separately, as is the way current modelling methods are carried out by the separate discipline areas of building design and manufacturing systems. Factory energy managers and future factory designs are example areas in which the presented integrated tool would be most beneficial used. Future research within this area could include an extension of the framework to model moisture transfer, the inclusion of further types of manufacturing process systems and further investigation into the coupling of time-driven and event-driven hybrid modelling techniques to simulate material flow both in terms of locality and thermal behaviour.Technology Strategy Board (reference number BD479L" ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "More than Total Economic Value: How to combine economic valuation of biodiversity with ecological resilience", "The assessment of total economic value has become a pragmatic and popular approach in nature valuation, yet criticisms have been raised. One major point of critique is that total economic value bases the monetary value of ecosystems purely on the flow of human benefits of services of ecosystems and consequently ignores questions of sustainable use of natural capital per se. This paper explains why total economic value by itself is in principle an inadequate concept to guide sustainable use of ecosystems and gives an overview of essential ecological theory that needs to be taken into account in addition to total economic value to fully include ecosystem sustainability. The paper concludes with a framework for combining ecological theory with economic valuation. The key elements here are theoretical ecological insights about ecosystem resilience and portfoliotheory which offers an economic perspective on investment in biodiversity. Portfolio theory puts total economic value in a framework where investment in biodiversity is expanded to cover functional diversity and mobile link species in order to maintain ecosystem resilience and so fosters sustainable use of ecosystems." ],

  "texts" : [ "Exploring the Role of Art-making in Recovery, Change, and Self-understanding: An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis of Interviews with Everyday Creative People", "Most creativity theorists consider artists as “agents of control”, capable of overcoming and controlling psychological distress. However, studies have yet to map the “healing” tendency for “everyday creative people” in detailing the process’ effects on perception and change. This study was aimed to examine this process via a phenomenological and Perceptual Control Theory perspective (PCT: see Powers, W. T. (1973). Behaviour: The control of perception. Chicago: Aldine). We recruited and interviewed eleven participants who had engaged in art-making and experienced recovery from psychological distress. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used to identify themes between participant responses, generated from self-created semi-structured interview schedules following Smith and Osborn’s technique (IPA: see Smith, J. A., & Osborn, M. (2008). Interpretativephenomenological analysis. In J. A. Smith (Ed.), Qualitative psychology: A practical guide to research methods, 2nd edition, (53-80). London: Sage). Data analysis identified six superordinate themes: 1) “the process of creating as a goal-oriented focus”, 2) “internalising process and product”, 3) “awareness shift and self-focus”, 4) “emotion regulation”, 5) “goal change, bonding, and conflict resolution”, and 6) “feelings and perceptions within the art-making process”. Disconfirming Case Analysis and participant feedback also indicated a seventh theme: 7) “the ‘superficial’ creative process”. The results were interpreted to indicate that art-making involves the purposeful creation of perceptual experience to fulfil higher-order goals and values. The creative process is also a learning process which instigates and promotes positive affect, enhances skills, and facilitates change in higher-order goals. We consider these interpretations in the light of the components of PCT." ],

The following essay analyses how the industrial relations actors of the German and French automotive industry, exemplified with particular reference to Volkswagen and Renault, mediate the pressure which has been induced through the increasing globalisation of production structures. The point of departure is the question whether globalisation might lead to institutional and procedural convergence or whether national and company specific modes of mediation, which encourage diverging modes of dealing with globalisation, persist. This question seems justified and plausible against the background of increasingly converging collective agreements on employment and competitiveness in virtually all major European car companies. Taking seriously this tendency of functional convergence the key question of the essay is whether more market-driven regulation modes under the impact of globalisation (e.g. agreements on securing employment and production) have the same implications for the industrial relations at Volkswagen and Renault." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Guilt and Creativity in the Works of Geoffrey Chaucer", "The late Middles Ages saw the development in Europe of increasingly complex, ambitious, and self-conscious forms of creative literature. In the works of poets such as Dante, Petrarch and Chaucer new models of authorship and poetic identity were being explored, new kinds of philosophical and aesthetic value attributed to literary discourse. But these creative developments also brought with them new dangers and tensions, a sense of guilt and uncertainty about the value of creative literature, especially in relation to the dominant religious values of late medieval culture.  In this thesis I explore how these doubts and tensions find expression in Chaucer’s poetry, not only as a negative, constraining influence, but also as something which contributes to the shape and meaning of poetry itself. I argue that as Chaucer develops his own expansive, questioning poetics in The House of Fame and The Canterbury Tales, he problematises the principle of allegory on which the legitimacy of literary discourse was primarily based in medieval culture and the final fragments of The Canterbury Tales see Chaucer struggling, increasingly, to reconcile the boldness and independence of his poetic vision with the demands of his faith. This struggle, which emerges most strongly and polemically in the final fragments, I argue, runs in subtle and creative forms throughout the whole of Chaucer’s work. By seeing Chaucer in this light as a poet not of fixed, but of conflicted and vacillating intentions – a poet productively caught drawn between ‘game’ and ‘earnest’, radical ironies and Boethian truths – I attempt to account, in a holistic manner, for the major dichotomies that characterise both his work and its critical reception." ],

  "texts" : [ "Christian Morality in Ghanaian Pentecostalism: A Theological Analysis of Virtue Theory as a Framework for Integrating Christian and Akan Moral Schemes", "This research was submitted to the University of Manchester by Lord Abraham Elorm-Donkor for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Its title, “Christian Morality in Ghanaian Pentecostalism: A Theological Analysis of Virtue Theory as a Framework for Integrating Christian and Akan Moral Schemes” indicates the scope of the research within African Pentecostal Studies.  Although scholars and Christian leaders have indicated that there is marked separation between morality and spirituality in the Christian praxis of many Africans and that the African worldview, which African Christians still hold is responsible for this separation, there has not been a detailed study of the issue. The aim of the research is to offer an explanation, of a paradox in Ghanaian society where there is enthusiastic Christian spirituality that is separated from social morality, so that a deeper integration of the Christian and Akan traditional moral schemes can be proposed.My research focuses on Pentecostals in Ghana whose appropriation of the African worldview into Christian praxis has generally been considered as a positive response to African religiosity. By the use of a practical theological method of correlation whereby the Christian truth is represented by the moral theology of John Wesley and brought in dialogue with the Akan traditional moral scheme, this research offers reasons for and proposes a solution to the lack of social morality in Ghanaian Pentecostalism. It uses the virtue theory as a heuristic tool for the analysis of morality in a way that provides explanation for the situation and guides an integration of the two moral schemes at a deeper level. The examination of the two moral schemes has been guided by the elements of character, a central theme of the virtue theory. It has been shown that the ‘Deliverance Theology’ of Ghanaian Pentecostals involves significant misrepresentation of the Akan traditional scheme, and that this situation causes many Christians to focus on religion as a means for the supply of existential needs rather than the transformation of inner dispositions for moral character formation. This research shows that reinterpreting the Akan view of humanity and integrating it with the Wesleyan account of the Christian truth, transforms the ‘Deliverance Theology’ by portraying the Christian life as a pneumatological characterology. The moral responsibility that this entails will ensure that African Pentecostals understand social morality as an essential outcome of their Christian spirituality." ],

Issuing more public debt alleviates this friction by increasing the aggregate quantity of collateral. In so doing, however, the issuance of more debt also raises interest rates, which in turn increases the tax burden of servicing the entire outstanding debt. We first document how this trade-off upsets the optimality of tax smoothing and, in contrast to the standard paradigm, helps induce a unique and stable steady-state level of debt in the deterministic version of the model. We next study the optimal policy response to fiscal and financial shocks in the stochastic version. We finally show how the results extend to a variant model in which the financial friction afflicts consumers rather than firms." ],

A survey containing Likert-type scales was used in collecting data from 203 international tourists who had travelled to Thailand. Using factor analysis, dimensions were identified for scales used in the study: travel cost satisfaction, tourist demographics, tourism product, tourism product attributes, and tourism product management. Results indicated that the travel cost satisfaction of international tourists had a positive influenced on tourism product attributes at 0.07 (t=1.96) with statistics significant at the level of 0.05. Also the travel cost satisfaction had a positive influence on tourism product management at 0.13 (t=4.02) with statistics significant at the level of 0.05. And the tourist demographics had a positive influenced on tourism product at 0.11(t=3.47) with statistic significant at the level of 0.05. As well as tourist demographics, which had a positive influenced on tourism management at 0.11 (t=3.57) with statistics significant at the level of 0.05.

The experiment was conducted in the C6 beamline of the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron at the Brookhaven National Laboratory using the Crystal Ball detector, which is a highly segmented multi-photon spectrometer covering nearly 4&pi; steradian. Data were collected at eight beam momenta: 520, 558, 580, 629, 657, 690, 720, and 750 MeV/<italic>c</italic>, corresponding to center-of-mass energies of 1571 to 1676 MeV.

As the international competition and customers' demands are changing from time to time, manufacturer has to change their business strategy and factory management in order for them to adapt and accommodate to these kinds of rapid changes. Not only that, it is also crucial for the manufacturer to remain competitive in the industry, however this is not easy to achieve for most of the manufacturer as there are many internal and external factors that will downgrade the productivity and affect the competitiveness of the firm, thereafter deliver poor quality of products and delay the work processes in the factory. Therefore it is important for the manufacturer to have an effective strategy that will guarantee, or at least help to reduce or minimize the operation cost by identify and eradicate non-value added processes (i.e. waste) in the factory, hence to improve the quality in every area of the value streams, this shall inclusive of factory management. Furthermore, the research also describes the effectiveness of the Value Stream Mapping (VSM) in moderating the impacts of the waste towards the factory productivity. Results of the literature review, which was used to identify both manufacturing an9 VSM practises, are presented. Current state map of the SEC's factory processes flow also being documented and discussed in this research. The findings of this literature review were synthesized to adapt its instrument to assess both the waste and productivity level in this factory. This is an exploratory study and the analysis of the survey results had shown that waiting time and defect has negative impact on factory productivity in the Sabah Elevator Company (SEC). VSM does show the moderating effect towards the waiting time on the factory productivity. The major contribution of this research enables the manufacturer to gain better understanding on how the non-value added processes (Le. waste) can downgrade the productivity in this factory. The implication of each variable as well as managerial implications, proposed future state map, and further suggestions for future research were identified and proposed." ],

The study involved sixty-four special education administrators, sixty-one special education teachers, and one hundred three special education teacher aides. Data were gathered by use of a questionnaire containing one hundred items representative of behavioral tasks usually performed by special education teachers or special education teacher aides. Participants were asked to respond to each of the one hundred items by marking one of five response categories ranging from \"exclusively or primarily the teacher-aide's responsibility to exclusively or primarily the teacher's responsibility.\" Data were analyzed statistically by use of chi-square and the .05 level of significance was chosen.Only school corporations or special education joint cooperatives employing ten or more special education teacher aides in classes for trainable and severely/profoundly mentally retarded were utilized in the study.Fifty-six of the one hundred questionnaire items met the requirements for statistical significance on the basis of a threeway group comparison at the .05 level. Subsequent, two-way chi-square tests were utilized to determine the response disparities for each possible two-way comparison among the three groups.Conclusions from the findings of the study were:1.  Perceptions held by special education administrators, special education teachers, and special                                 education teacher aides differed concerning the role of the special education teacher aide.2.   Based upon more frequent involvement of statistically significant two-way comparisons, special education teacher aides perceived the role of the special education teacher aide less clearly than special education administrators and special education teachers. 3. Based upon more frequent involvement of statistically significant two-way comparisons, special education administrators perceived the role of the special education teacher aide less clearly than special education teachers.4. Based upon less frequent involvement of statistically significant two-way comparisons, special education teachers perceived the role of the special education teacher aide more clearly than special education administrators or special education teacher aides.5. Pre-service and in-service training programs do not provide the necessary congruent role adaptation and role integration for clear definition of role and role relationships.6. Role responsibilities have not been identified for the special education teacher aide.Data supported similar findings of other researchers that I individual efficiency of the job performance of a special education teacher aide is lessened when role and role relationships are not clear.Data supported similar findings of other researchers that organizational effectiveness is lessened when the special education teacher aide is not efficient in job performance.The emergence of role and role relationships of the special education teacher aide evolved from the interaction between the special education teacher and the special education teacher aide and not through definition.The possibility of conflict or incongruency may occur when individual need-dispositions are not the same as the organizational expectations of the role.The possibility of conflict or incongruency may occur when role incumbents are expected to conform and perform simultaneously to different reference groups.Evaluation and supervision of the role incombents would be spurious due to different reference groups expectations.Instruction questionnaire items had the greatest perceptual response disparity between and among the special education administrators, special education teachers, and the special education teacher aides.Clerical questionnaire items had the next greatest perceptual response disparity between and among the special education administrators, special education teachers, and special education teacher aides.The least differences of perceptual response disparity regarding the role of the special education teacher aide were in the areas of supervisory and custodial duties.3" ],

  "texts" : [ "Escaping the tyranny of earned income? The failure of finance as social innovation", "Before the crisis which started in 2007, the mass marketing of retail financial products in high income countries since the early 1980s was understood through rhetorics about individual emancipation as the ‘democratisation of finance’ and ‘ownership society’, where supporters and critics debated in a shared framework. From a post 2007 perspective, it is time to revalue these developments. This paper changes the frame around the debate and constructs theextension of credit and ownership as a major social innovation led by profit seeking retail banks. It then presents empirical evidence from the United States, which suggests that the extension of credit and asset ownership in an unequal society is self defeating because it does not abolish the tyranny of earned income and, indeed, it tightens the vice insofar as low income individuals and households accumulate debt but not assets. The implication is that finance as privately led social innovation has failed and it is time for fundamental rethinking of much that has been taken for granted." ],

  "texts" : [ "Expanding the role of the stroke nurse: a pragmatic clinical trial.", "AIMS: This paper reports a study evaluating whether expanding a specialist nursing role to provide outreach education and support to stroke patients and carers after discharge from hospital is effective in promoting recovery. BACKGROUND: Building therapeutic relationships with patients and carers is a key component of the nursing role in stroke rehabilitation, although this is limited by the constraints of service organization. METHODS: A pragmatic randomized controlled trial was undertaken. Patients with a diagnosis of stroke were randomized to receive continued support from a stroke nurse (n = 87) or usual care and follow-up (n = 89) after discharge from hospital. Patients were recruited from two hospitals in the north-west of England from November 1999 to April 2001. Patient dependence (Barthel Index), general health (Nottingham Health Profile), activities of living (Frenchay Activity of Living Index), depression (Beck Depression Inventory) and carer strain (Carer Strain Index) were assessed at 3 and 12 months after stroke. RESULTS: The continued intervention of a stroke nurse after discharge was associated with improved patient perceptions of general health at 12 months (median difference 42.6, P = 0.012), and in particular reduced negative emotional reaction (P = 0.037) and perceived social isolation (P = 0.002). In addition, the intervention reduced carer strain at 3 months (P = 0.045), and reduced deterioration in physical dependence from 3 to 12 months (P = 0.049). CONCLUSION: The provision of continued intervention from a stroke nurse after discharge from hospital, focusing on education and support, has tangible benefits for patients and carers." ],

  "texts" : [ "Macroalgal responses to experimental nutrient enrichment in shallow coastal waters : growth, internal nutrient pools, and isotopic signatures", "Increased nutrient inputs to temperate coastal waters have led to increased occurrences of macroalgal blooms worldwide. To identify nutrients that are limiting to macroalgae and to determine whether different forms of these nutrients and long-term ambient nutrient conditions affect macroalgal response, we used in situ enrichment methods and tested the response of 2 bloom-forming species of macroalgae, Ulva lactuca and Gracilaria tikvahiae, from shallow estuaries of Waquoit Bay, Massachusetts, USA, that receive different land-derived N inputs. We enriched caged macroalgal fronds with nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, and N + P combinations, and measured growth, nutrient content, and δ15N signatures of fronds after 2 wk of incubation. In these estuaries, P did not limit growth, however, the 2 species differed in growth response to N additions. Growth of U. lactuca was greater in Childs River (CR), the estuary with higher nitrate inputs, than in Sage Lot Pond (SLP); growth in SLP increased with nitrate and ammonium enrichment. In contrast, growth of G. tikvahiae was greater in SLP than in CR, but had no growth response to N enrichment in either site. C and N contents differed initially between species and sites, and after nutrient enrichment. Final tissue % N increased and C:N decreased after nitrate and ammonium enrichment. δ15N values of the macroalgae demonstrated uptake of the experimental fertilizers, and a higher affinity and faster turnover of internal N pools with ammonium than nitrate enrichment in both species. We suggest that U. lactuca blooms in areas with both high nitrate and ammonium water column concentrations, and is more N-limited in oligotrophic waters where DIN levels are too low to sustain high growth rates. G. tikvahiae has a greater N storage capacity than U. lactuca, which may allow it to grow in less nutrient-rich waters.Author Posting. © Inter-Research, 2008.

  "texts" : [ "Case Study: “Hair meets Design”: The Application of Storytelling in the Context of Long-Distance Collaboration and Virtual Teamwork", "<p>Virtual teamwork and long distance collaboration is an increasingly attractive option in design education especially when students and other participants, (for example, industry guests or sponsors) cannot meet in the same physical place or classroom.</p>\n<p>\nThe constant improvement in technology allows this type of electronic communication to be increasingly accepted as an appropriate format for collaboration and evaluation of student projects. </p>\n<p>\nThis paper discusses the collaboration between members of a company in Germany and a group of industrial design students in California. It will present the work flow, the evaluation tools and the formats introduced during the process.</p>\n<p>\nSince the participants of this project could not meet physically to discuss and evaluate ideas, it was imperative for the teams to develop standard visual formats that were easy to understand and re-utilize. These formats had to be flexible enough for the purpose of adding comments from the evaluators. </p>\n<p>\nBecause the physical presence of the presenter is missing, it is necessary to adjust the content and layout of the messages in order to make them more relevant and self-explanatory. The message has to be easy to understand without the help of a presenter or lecturer. </p>\n<p>\nOne of the most significant questions in this project was how to present multiple “layers of information” in one single image at the same time (for example, how to depict work flow, time sequence and object hierarchy in one single frame). </p>\n<p>\nIn a normal situation (where the presenter is physically present in front of an audience) he/she can verbally add secondary information that would not be visually included but it is necessary in order to understand the relevance of the image being presented. This additional verbal information could be related to time, hierarchy, etc.</p>\n<p>\nThis paper will discuss the development and evaluation of visual formats that present multiple layers of information in one single image. It describes the methods used and reports the solutions. Ultimately, this paper explains the relevance of using storytelling in the context of long-distance design collaboration.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Keywords:</strong> <br />\nVirtual Teamwork; Long-Distance Collaboration; Storytelling; Infographics</p>" ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Patients’ and carers’ views of quality palliative and supportive district nursing care", "Quality of care is conceptualised by professionals and in policy documents as: compliance with ‘best practice’ guidelines; improving satisfaction rates; fiscal efficiency; and ethical care. ‘Quality’ in palliative and supportive district nursing care has been conceptualised in all these ways. However, the empirical research in this area draws mostly on professionals’ and carers’ views with little research addressing patients’ views. With political rhetoric pushing for a ‘patient led’ NHS, research into how patients conceptualise quality in this area is necessary to both critique this rhetoric and/or facilitate its aims. Therefore, this research investigates patients’ and carers’ views on the quality of palliative and supportive district nursing care.Participants were recruited to an exploratory qualitative study resulting in a convenience sample of twenty six patients (all of district nursing caseloads) and thirteen carers. All participants were over eighteen, able to consent, lived in their own homes, were under the care of district nurses, and had palliative care needs. Eighteen participants had a cancer diagnosis, six had a non-malignant diagnosis, one had co-morbidities, and one participant did not disclosed their diagnosis. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with all participants, five participants were interviewed twice. Post-structuralist theories were used with discourse analysis techniques for the final analysis.The findings identify three of the most influential discourses in relation to the morality and quality of care: Firstly, ‘busyness’, and how its performance by district nurses masks patients’ and carers’ ability to critique care, instead producing a pseudo-quality which fixes patients and carers subjectivities. Secondly, ‘power/knowledge’ and the ways in which it prevents patients and carers accessing care which they need, and altering care to suit their needs. Thirdly, ‘the home’ and how it (re)forms district nursing care and district nursing care (re)forms the home; meaning that actions by district nurses must also consider the impact on the home as well as the patients and carers. In conclusion quality care may be produced by: ceasing to measure quality; involving patients and carers with commissioning and directing palliative and supportive care; supporting groups other than district nurses such as patients, carers and third parties to produce and distribute knowledge about district nursing care; increasing patients’ and carers’ ability to communicate with one another about their care.Further research may investigate: how patients and carers with palliative and supportive care needs may be involved in commissioning; the most appropriate wording and means to distribute knowledge about palliative and supportive district nursing care; ethnographic work to explore how district nursing and the home interact; more detailed theorisation of how the material and the discursive can be accounted for within post-structuralism." ],

  "texts" : [ "Black Caribbean Immigrants in the United States and their Perceptions of Racial Discrimination: Understanding the Impact of Racial Identity, Ethnic Identity and Racial Socialization", "This study sought to address an existing gap in the multicultural research literature by exploring the impact of racial identity, ethnic identity, and racial socialization on perceptions of racial discrimination among Black Caribbean immigrants to the United States. Participants included 120 English-speaking Black Caribbean immigrant adults who completed a survey consisting of: a demographic information sheet, the Black Racial Identity Attitude Scale - Long Form (RIAS-L), the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM), the Teenager Experience of Racial Socialization Scale (TERS), and the Perceived Racism Scale (PRS). A Pearson's correlational analysis found significant relationships between racial identity and ethnic identity, with the racial identity status attitudes Encounter, Immersion-Emersion, and Internalization being positively related to overall ethnic identity. Linear regression analyses were then conducted using racial socialization as a predictor variable and racial identity status attitudes as well as overall ethnic identity as criterion variables. Significant positive relationships were found between racial socialization and the racial identity status attitudes Encounter, Immersion-Emersion, and Internalization, as well as between racial socialization and overall ethnic identity. Two simple linear regressions were initially conducted in order to determine whether racial socialization might be predictive of perceptions of racial discrimination for the year as well as the lifetime. Significant positive relationships were found between racial socialization and perceived racism scores for both the year and the lifetime. Further regression analyses also found the racial socialization factor Cultural Alertness to Discrimination (CAD) to be a unique positive predictor of perceptions of racial discrimination for the year as well as the lifetime. Subsequent hierarchical regression analyses later indicated that racial socialization significantly predicted perceptions of racial discrimination for the year and the lifetime above and beyond racial identity. Racial socialization was also a significant predictor of perceptions of racial discrimination for the year and the lifetime after accounting for overall ethnic identity. Finally, MANOVA results indicated that first generation and second generation participants differed significantly on: the racial identity status attitude Encounter, overall ethnic identity, as well as the racial socialization factor Cultural Alertness to Discrimination (CAD). In sum, findings from the current study suggest that racial socialization experiences have a substantial impact on perceptions of racial discrimination and play an important role in racial and ethnic identity development. Implications for research and practice are discussed" ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Neural correlates of auditory word processing in infants and adults", "For the majority of people, words are first learned and are communicated in high proportions in the auditory modality. However, the neural dynamics underlying speech perception are poorly understood. Even more limited, is knowledge of the neurophysiological processes and neuroanatomical structures that afford developing language abilities in infants. This dissertation investigates these issues in a series of related studies that are aimed at characterizing the spatial and temporal neural dynamics of auditory word processing in both developing 12-19 month old infants and adults. The first study, performed in adults, reveals new evidence for a neural response that is selective for auditory words, relative to acoustically- matched control sounds. This response appears to index a stage in speech processing wherein an incoming word sound is translated from an acoustic signal into a linguistically relevant code. This information can then be passed along the speech processing stream so that eventually the appropriate meaning of a word can be selected amongst representations stored within associative left fronto-temporal networks. The second study, performed in both adults and 12-18 month old infants, demonstrates that the neural mechanism responsible for encoding lexico-semantic word information has similar spatial and temporal characteristics in infants and adults. Prior work has not been able to establish whether infants and adults share similar neural substrates for language, and these findings suggest that the neurophysiological processes important for word understanding reside within similar neural networks throughout the lifespan. Finally, to gain a better understanding of the regional neuroanatomical changes that take place in the developing cortex of 12-19 month old- infants, the third study examines age-related changes tissues signal properties assessed with magnetic resonance imaging. This a period in development that is pivotal for emerging linguistic, cognitive and sensorimotor behaviors, however, the maturational changes that occur brain structures are poorly understood at these ages. This study reveals large changes in structural measures within precisely the specific areas that were demonstrated to generate lexico-semantic activity in study two. Together, these studies help to advance current understanding of neurophysiological processing stages and neural structures involved in auditory word processing in both the developing and mature brain. These findings invite a host of new studies that will continue to further knowledge of how speech processing is instantiated within the brain. Finally, with the use of multimodal imaging techniques such as those described in the present studies, there is increasing potential for new research aimed at understanding the neurobiological underpinning of language and other cognitive behaviors" ],

Imatinib was evaluated both alone and in combination with established chemotherapeutic agents in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) primary cultures and established cell lines representing squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC). Over 90% of ACC tumors are c-kit-positive, and these primary cultures proved to be of short-term usefulness in assessing chemosensitivity. Interaction was determined over a wide range of drug combinations using a statistical three-dimensional analysis model. Both ACC short-term cultures and HNSCC cell lines were demonstrated to have a response ranging from additive to synergistic when imatinib and cisplatin were combined. The interaction of imatinib on cisplatin-induced DNA cross-linking was further investigated using the comet-X assay. In contrast, significant antagonism was observed when imatinib and gemcitabine were combined. Since gemcitabine is activated by deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), the effect of imatinib on this enzyme was investigated. A dose-dependent inhibition of dCK was observed, highlighting this kinase as a possible additional secondary molecular target for imatinib. This work demonstrates a synergistic interaction between cisplatin and imatinib, which may prove to be clinically relevant in the future management of both ACC and HNSCC." ],

Discussion of the way that same-sex and opposite-sex attraction impacts on the workplace is rarely theorised either because it is considered uncivilised or taboo.

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Competitiveness and Technological Upgrading in Global Value Chains: Evidence from the Indonesian Electronics and Garment Sectors", "Indonesia is a rapidly growing and internationally competitive economy that is well integrated into globalised production systems. The global value chain (GVC) model has proven a popular analytical framework to explain how global lead firms structure and organise global production through dispersed global suppliers. Indonesia’s leading export sectors, garments and electronics, are well integrated into GVCs. Engagement in GVCs, often led by leading global brands, is seen as a basis for local producers to become globally competitive and to grow. It also comes with challenges – local producers must meet the demanding pressures from lead firms on prices, on-time delivery, product quality, and social, environmental and labour standards. The possibilities for local producers to learn, acquire new capabilities and upgrade to enhance their competitiveness are often conditioned by the nature of ties that they have with their global lead firms. Yet, this paper argues, the GVC model fails to recognise agency on the part of local firms in this learning process. Moreover, particular forms of governance arrangements within GVC ties can restrict prospects for local producers to enhance capabilities and upgrade. Drawing on selected case study evidence from the Indonesian garments and electronics sectors, the paper explores the relationship between distinct types of GVC engagements and firm level learning and upgrading, and considers how some GVC ties may restrict upgrading." ],

  "texts" : [ "[[alternative]]Interacting with Ishikawa：A study of Watercolor Artworks Created by Ni Jiang-huai, Ran In-ting, Lee Tze-fan", "[[abstract]]Art in any form is used to carry for future generations the culture, life style and times of a generation. Art education is needed to interpret the message carried in these work of art, be it poetry, dance, painting, etc. to common people. In the present theses an attempt is made to bring out the efforts of three great artists of Taiwan who lived during the Japanese occupation of Taiwan. We have come to know a lot of the lives of the people of Taiwan and its semitropical landscapes through their simple water color paintings. In the days their masterpieces still stand out.  \n    The art education in the Japanese colonial period laid the foundation for the fine arts movement in Taiwan. The older generation painters lived under an unequal and arduous environment of the education system, but still demonstrated the firm endurance of the people of this island. \nMr. Ishikawa came to Taiwan to teach art paining. The young painters of that time came under his influence and were encouraged and inspired by him. His influence is diverse. The Taiwanese youth of that time learned to observe their own native landscape, paint from live real life scenery they observe. They also pursued scholarly work such as teaching painting methodology, aesthetic values, attitude of conducting oneself, etc. Students admired and absorbed from the teacher's kind, humorous, witty, graceful, elegant and simple manners. They learned to apply these elegant artistic views, transformed in a perceptible manner, into their one's own artistic creation. Mr. Ishikawa was also responsible for activating an art that needs deeper thinking. \nMr. Ishikawa's painting skills and techniques are seen in the graceful brush strokes in painting and calligraphy. His simple and elegant style brought life into the paintings of the native landscape. They also represent his life full of aesthetics. Mr. Ishikawa carried the nostalgia and romanticism of his native land into his painting of the Taiwanese landscape and they represent the view as seen through the eyes of a Japanese painter. Did his students reflect this phenomenon in their paintings? No. His disciples, while describing the natural beauty of the scenery of Taiwan, brought the beautiful expression, representing local culture and reality. \nIn the application of color, Mr. Ishikawa used hues that are light, fresh and elegant that are characteristic of the Japanese culture and surroundings, with contrast colors emphasizing on the visual impact. The work of the disciples on the other hand reflects the thick strongly fragrant colors of the national characteristic such as bright sunshine, the misty subtropical environment, with gorgeous tones representing straight and passionate styles. \nOn the painting skills, Mr. Ishikawa gives more importance to the technique than the feelings. Thus his technique brings out his feelings. He expressed the rhythm of color and light to represent beauty. He also used a combination of light and colors to give a depth to his paintings. The lines in his paintings are smooth and move fluently. His first student Mr. Ni Jiang-huai followed Mr. Ishikawa’s technique and style totally all through his life. Mr. Ran In-ting is a naturally gifted painter and learnt his skills fully from his teacher. While his paintings reflect the mastery of his teacher they also show a development of his own style. His paintings reflect his feelings. He used his concept to lead his feelings. He draws lines confidently bringing about dramatic effects. His paintings also reflect the rich Chinese style. Mr. Lee Tze-fan, the third student of Mr. Ishikawa shows loving care for the feeling of the land while observing social life deeply. He was involved in presenting real life in his paintings showing the value of people and culture. His painting style is down to earth being steady, rich, and sincere. On the whole, the artistic work of Mr. Ran, In-ting and Mr. Lee Tze-fan reflect the inner heart and the external reality of the social and cultural life and environment of their times.\nThrough insistence and persistence, the three disciples of Ishikawa laid a foundation to the art of water color painting while observing and presenting the special natural conditions and social customs in Taiwan in their paintings. Through their spontaneous feelings and a long time practice they established their faith in watercolor paintings. They used their own eyes to examine the natural beauty of their land closely and presented it to their viewers through their paintings. Thus their paintings represent the scenery as seen through their eyes and reflect the natural pulsation, temperature, the shades, the real hues, tone and chrome of color of Taiwan Landscape. They present trough their paintings the surrounds, the sunshine, the seas, the meadows, the scents in the air and a tropical pastoral image of the beautiful Land of Taiwan for the posterity. Their paintings preserve the collective history of Taiwan and are a witness to the development of art movement in Taiwan. \nThrough their efforts and break-troughs Ishikawa and his brilliant students left behind foot prints taken one at a time revealing the glory of the great artists. From this we see their firm strength as they go from simplicity to complexity. As it is said that to be simple is the most difficult sometimes and greatness lies in simplicity. The proof for this, as in mathematics, comes from the theater of the human life and is no exception as seen from the foot prints left by these great artists. \nThe researcher realizes that it is important to trace the history of art education in Taiwan. In the past hundred years the art in Taiwan has grown leaps and bounds with the focus shifting to oil paintings. But the water color paintings of these three students of Ishikawa cannot be ignored. Let us cherish the memory of Mr. Ni Jiang-huai, Mr. Ran In-ting, and Mr. Lee Tze-fan who gave their lives to the promotion of water color paintings. I present my most profound and heartfelt respects to all of them through this thesis.\nThis study focuses on these developments in six chapters which will discuss the theoretical and structural basis of the research. In addition, art works are also provided as supporting evidence.\nChapter one introduces, the research background and motivation, the purpose, method, range, restrictions and structure. Chapter two documents discussions, about the introduction of research backgrounds related to this research. It is divided into the research of Taiwan art history during Japanese colonial period, art education history of that period, a history of landscape painting development, research into the paintings from western world and Japan, and history of the development of watercolor painting in Japan and Taiwan. Chapter three introduces the main part, i. e. Mr. Ishikawa interacting with his students. It also includes Mr. Ishikawa’s personal life history, his education methodology, aesthetic concepts, art works, and his influence and contributions. To prevent the appearance of a bias, a brief mention is also made of other students who learned from Mr. Ishikawa besides Mr. Ni, Mr. Ran, and Mr. Lee. Chapter four gives an account of about the personal life history, special personality traits, attitude of creating, the way they looked at the nature, artistic concepts, aesthetic views, the statements from other people about the painter, the contributions, and the watercolor works of Mr. Ni, Mr. Ran, and Mr. Lee. Chapter five gives a comparison of the teacher and his students. It relates to their art works, describes how the official exhibitions influenced their standing in society, and acted as means to compare their works in content and form, and how the disciples went out on their own paths finally to create their individual unique styles. Chapter six the gives the conclusions based on the points raised in this study and takes personal responsibility for the shortcomings in the presentation." ],

  "texts" : [ "A prototypic mathematical model of the human hair cycle.", "The human hair cycle is a complex, dynamic organ-transformation process during which the hair follicle repetitively progresses from a growth phase (anagen) to a rapid apoptosis-driven involution (catagen) and finally a relative quiescent phase (telogen) before returning to anagen. At present no theory satisfactorily explains the origin of the hair cycle rhythm. Based on experimental evidence we propose a prototypic model that focuses on the dynamics of hair matrix keratinocytes. We argue that a plausible feedback-control structure between two key compartments (matrix keratinocytes and dermal papilla) leads to dynamic instabilities in the population dynamics resulting in rhythmic hair growth. The underlying oscillation consists of an autonomous switching between two quasi-steady states. Additional features of the model, namely bistability and excitability, lead to new hypotheses about the impact of interventions on hair growth. We show how in silico testing may facilitate testing of candidate hair growth modulatory agents in human HF organ culture or in clinical trials." ],

  "texts" : [ "Vitamin k deficiency is associated with incident knee osteoarthritis.", "BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, with knee osteoarthritis being the leading cause of lower extremity disability among older adults in the US. There are no treatments available to prevent the structural pathology of osteoarthritis. Because of vitamin K's role in regulating skeletal mineralization, it has potential to be a preventative option for osteoarthritis. We therefore examined the relation of vitamin K to new-onset radiographic knee osteoarthritis and early osteoarthritis changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: Subjects from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis (MOST) Study had knee radiographs and MRI scans obtained at baseline and 30 months later, and plasma phylloquinone (vitamin K) measured at baseline. We examined the relationship of subclinical vitamin K deficiency to incident radiographic knee osteoarthritis and MRI-based cartilage lesions and osteophytes, respectively, using log binomial regression with generalized estimating equations, adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Among 1180 participants (62% women, mean age 62±8 years, mean body mass index 30.1±5.1 kg/m(2)), subclinical vitamin K deficiency was associated with incident radiographic knee osteoarthritis (risk ratio [RR] 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-2.25) and cartilage lesions (RR 2.39; 95% CI, 1.05-5.40) compared with no deficiency, but not with osteophytes (RR 2.35; 95% CI, 0.54-10.13). Subclinically vitamin K-deficient subjects were more likely to develop osteoarthritis in one or both knees than neither knee (RR 1.33; 95% CI, 1.01-1.75 and RR 2.12; 95% CI, 1.06-4.24, respectively). CONCLUSION: In the first such longitudinal study, subclinical vitamin K deficiency was associated with increased risk of developing radiographic knee osteoarthritis and MRI-based cartilage lesions. Further study of vitamin K is warranted given its therapeutic/prophylactic potential for osteoarthritis." ],

  "title" : "The Ranking of Financing Methods in Urban Old Texture (Case Study of Isfahan City)",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "The Ranking of Financing Methods in Urban Old Texture (Case Study of Isfahan City)", "Extended abstract1- IntroductionAging and building of old texture, in various forms, including the reduction or loss of viability conditions and safety problems as well as physical, social, economic and infrastructural can be received and identified. The essential need for reconstruction and rehabilitation of the urban old textures is the development of environment for humans. The necessary requirements are socio - cultural and economic (Shamaei and Pourahmad, 2006: 43).The first thing to be considered in this regard is the ways of providing financial tools for this issue (Jafarzadeh, M. and Jannati, M. 2009:525). According to the latest estimates of Reconstruction Organization of Tehran (2010), the total volume of old textures in country is 65,000 acres. The cost of developing infrastructures of urban old textures is estimated to be about 100 billion Rials per acre and the time needed to reconstruct all old textures, with allocation of current resources and regardless of erosion growth, is 78 years. This shows that because reconstruction and rehabilitation of this enormous volume of urban old textures are capital intensive, they requires a lot of time.  On the other hand, providing required capital is not in the ability of the government, the Municipality or the banking system and it needs more and more private sector's partnership through applying financing tools in financial markets.  In this research, the issue is being addressed by studying the most important and useful financing tools for reconstructing and rehabilitating urban old textures and also studying the important criteria for choosing a suitable financing tool applying AHP.This research is applied and its method is a descriptive one of survey field. Using survey field and library studies, most of the tools which could be used to reconstruct and rehabilitate old urban texture in a way that they have operational experience in large cities and the criteria considered choosing a good financing tool are studied. The spatial domain of current research is financial experts of \"reconstruction and rehabilitation organization of Isfahan city\" and \"Isfahan Municipality\". Time zone of this research is from December 2009 to December 2010. 2-Theoretical basesThe required capital for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the whole old urban textures, according to rehabilitation organization of Tehran's estimates, is 5 times bigger than government budget in 2010 and 59 times bigger than all Municipalities of Iran in 2008. This subject demonstrates that providing required capital is not merely in capabilities of the public sector or Municipality (Ranjbarian, 2010, p.142). But it needs the widely usage of financial markets and the financial tools which is possible via more cooperation between both public and private sectors.From a theoretical perspective, the concept of the cooperation between public and private sectors is related to the \"X-efficiency\" theory which was introduced in 1966 by American economist Harvey Leibenstein (1922-1993). According to his view, until the public economic institutions and enterprises receive official blessing of financial resources and enough monetary policy for release, offset and limit their possible failure, they will never go bankrupt. Kargar (2004), Moezzi Moghadam (2004) and Akbari and Tavasoli (2009) also pointed out the instability and insufficiency of Municipalities' revenue. Providing large amount of capital for reconstruction and rehabilitation of old textures is not possible without cooperation with private sector and collecting people's savings by applying various financing tools in a way that can be used in old texture. Hans Klijn, Erik et al. (2002), believed that because of the instability of the revenues of local government (inelasticity of income cods and reverse impact of increasing the rates of complication on income earned by the municipality) and on the other hand, the increase in these kind of services, local governments have no choice but to bring the private sector's resources. Also, Michael Foster (1995), considering the private sector's role in urban projects, believes that in a situation which the governments because of the economic fluctuations and limitations of financial resources are not able to provide service spaces, the private sector's capitals can well make profit and meantime help in rehabilitation and enhancing urban service usages.By studying financial structure of countries, we find out that basically financial structure of any country can be put on the two main money market or capital markets and according to it, the financing ways lie in two following categories:  -Asset-based financial -Debt-based financial In developed countries, the capital market mostly is the central part of financial structure. By contrast, in most of developing nations, money market is the financing way which causes the companies to be largely dependent on the banking system to meet their financial needs (Dadras Moghaddam and Parivash, 2009: 338(.Asset-based financial method needs transferring part of the project profit for getting capital. The main asset-based financing method which can be used in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of urban old textures are:  -Assets securitization-Project-shareholders-Sale yards-Private sector participation and investmentDebt-based financing method involves the amount of money that the investor has barrowed and should repay with its interest during a period of time. The main debt-based financing methods which can be used in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of urban old textures according to the study of Najjarzadeh, Jannati and Farhadi (2009) and Mashhad, Isfahan and Tehran reports include the following: -The deposit and lending system-The use of foreign finance-Foreign investment-The private sector participation and investmentThis research uses Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to determine the priority of the most important financing methods used for reconstruction and rehabilitation of urban old textures and to study the criteria influence the choice of suitable financing tool.Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is one of the best and most accurate methods of ranking and deciding based on several criteria. AHP implementation in a decision involves four phases: the construction of a hierarchy, performing paired comparisons, calculating weights, system compatibility assessment.3-DiscussionThe final results of this research show that the private sector participation with final weight of 0.323 is the best financing method for reconstruction and rehabilitation of urban old textures according to the research's criteria. The risk in this method is much less than in other financing methods. Also, the private sector participation in higher return rate criteria with the relative rate of 0.319 is in first place. The cost of this method is low and only the cost of the money providing process is higher in this method comparing to the others. But the relative weight of the cost of money providing criteria in comparison to the other ones is lower; thus in general, it has not changed the private sector participation rank. After that the private sector investment comes in the second place with its final weight of 0.235. This method is in the first place in low risk criteria. According to return rate criteria, it is in second place after the private sector participation with the relative rate of 0.293. The costs of this method, in comparison to the others, were high. But the importance of cost measure in comparison to the other criteria is low and about 0.091; it has not changed the private sector investment place. The project- shareholder method with final weight of 0.178 comes after and in the second place among all methods. This method has the least cost and its rank according to private sector participation with the relative rate of 0.227 is the second. But according to the budget provided and higher return rates, it is in the fourth rank. The sale yards method with final weight of 0.135 has the fourth rank. This method according to lower cost measure with the relative weight of 0.183 is in the third place. Considering the return rate criteria, it has the least return among the other methods with the relative rate of 0.112. Also, the risk is higher in this method comparing to the others and with the relative rate of 0.197 it is in the fourth place.The banks funding method with the relative weight of 0.129 has the fifth or the last rank. The results of this research do not suggest applying this method in comparison to the other methods introduced in current study. This method has the highest risk and the lowest cooperation of the private sector. Considering the measures of the cost of the money providing process and financial costs, it has the fourth rank. Also, according to the return rate and the budget provided with the relative weight of 0.147 and 0.138, respectively has the third rank.     5- ConclusionAlthough government officials are aware of the importance of executing the project, but government aids to this community is at least and the rules are not supporting using government facilities.As the results showed, the method of private sector participation with total weight of 0.323 is the best method for reconstructing and rehabilitating old urban texture. Thus, government officials need to consider this and provide required facilities to supply bonds. Also, according to results, the private sector investment with final weight of 0.235 is in the second place in financing methods priority. On the other hand, considering the advantages of this method and also its high place in ranking due to criteria, more attention is needed. The bank funding method with relative weight of 0.129 has the last or fifth ranking. The results do not suggest applying this method comparing to the other financing methods used in this research.6- Suggestions -The results show that the private investment with final weight of 0.235 is in the second place in financing methods priority. On the other hand, considering the advantages of this method and also its high place in ranking due to criteria, more attention should be given to it.-As the results showed, the method of private sector participation is the best method for reconstructing and rehabilitating old urban texture. Thus, government officials need to consider this and provide required facilities to supply bonds.-To use private sector resources, whether in the form of investing in a project or the owner's participation, well and on time announcement of project's conditions is one of the main preconditions and advertisement and announcement are among the items which yet no investment is done for them and we can say that this is one of the problems in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of projects and solving it can be very useful for financing resources.  -The rate of return was one important criterion in current research to attract private sector's partnership. So, it is necessary to consider profit rate in financing methods in a way that private sector's capitals instead of being invested in banks, be used in profitable urban projects which will either bring more economic profit or make the city more beautiful, healthier and with more and better services. -Designing new financing methods for reconstructing and rehabilitating old urban texture considering the criteria ranking of this research.Also, it is suggested that in the case of using AHP method, try to have more variation in financing methods.Key words: Financing, Partnership, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction, Old texture, Analytic Hierarchy Process AHPReferencesAkbari, N and Zahedi Keyvan, M.

  "texts" : [ "The influence of dietary intake on the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system across three ethnic groups: a population-based study.", "OBJECTIVE: The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system has been implicated in the aetiopathogenesis of cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Since dietary factors and ethnicity are considered contributory to the development of these diseases, we examined the IGF system in relation to nutritional intake by ethnic group. DESIGN, SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Dietary intake in 257 subjects of White European, African-Caribbean and Pakistani ethnic origin living in Manchester, UK was assessed using ethnic-group-specific food-frequency questionnaires to assess habitual nutrient intake over the previous 12 months. Fasting IGF-I, IGF-II and IGF-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) concentrations were determined and their relationship to specific dietary constituents was analysed. RESULTS: Analysis by quintiles of nutrient intake showed a significant increase in circulating IGF-I concentration with increasing dietary fat intake (F for trend=3.9, ), saturated fat intake and for protein intake There was also a significant increase in IGF-II by quintiles of dietary protein intake There was a trend for increasing IGF-I with increasing energy intake. The relationships between circulating concentration of IGFBP-1, an acute regulator of IGF action, and fat/protein intake were opposite to those for IGF-I and IGF-II. Multiple linear regression modelling showed that people of Pakistani origin and older subjects had lower levels of IGF-I (Pakistani origin vs. others, ) (age, for both). There was an independent inverse relationship between IGF-I and dietary carbohydrate intake CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence for a dietary contribution to regulation of the IGF system, although the effects of ethnicity on circulating IGF levels remain dominant. We propose that the IGF system's influences on cancer risk in specific ethnic groups are potentially modifiable by dietary intervention." ],

  "texts" : [ "Essays in corporate finance", "This thesis contributes to the empirical literature on how firms meet exceptional financing needs in relation to “investment spikes” or years with unusually large investment activities. In the earlier part of the thesis, I show that the financing of investment during an investment spike is very different from that at other times. I have done this using data for publicly traded US firms over the period 1988 to 2007 and a filtering procedure suggested by Bond et al. (2006). Specifically, external finance, in particular debt finance, is very important in financing investment in years categorized as investment spikes, confirming the findings of Mayer and Sussman (2005). In addition, it has been found that firms with smaller size, lower profitability, more future growth opportunities, fewer tangible assets and more R&D spending tend to use more equity finance in relation to large investment requirements. I also propose the use of the Markov-switching filter to identify investment spikes. In implementing the Markov-switching filter, I apply a first-order two-state Markov-switching mean model to the investment rates de-trended using Hodrick and Prescott's (1997) filter. A Gibbs-sampling procedure is used to produce the marginal posterior distributions of unobserved state variables and model parameters. Among other advantages, this filter allows us to identify multi-year investment spikes. I show that two-year investment spikes identified by the Markov-switching filter are financed quite similarly to single-year investment spikes and that main findings are robust to calendar-time-dependent clustering of investment spikes generated by macroeconomic shocks.  In the later part of the thesis, I find there is a positive effect of share liquidity on the propensity to raise debt finance. Using a sample of firm-year observations identified as investment spikes, I find that firms with more liquid shares tend to rely more heavily on debt to finance investment spikes. This result is robust to a control for the effects of firm size and other firm characteristics, the use of various leverage measures, and the use of a whole sample with investment spike characteristics. Another important finding is that firms with more liquid shares tend to have higher target leverage ratios. One interpretation of these results is that information spillovers from the presence of more informative share prices allow firms with more liquid shares to borrow on more favourable terms in normal times, as well as to obtain additional debt finance at lower costs when taking advantage of unusually large investment opportunities.This thesis is not currently available via ORA." ],

The quantity of rice imports was considered as a function of factors such as the amount of the lagged import, exchange rate, external reserves, structural adjustment programme (SAP), per capita income and import price of rice. However, quantitative estimates, based on cointegration and error correction specification using the Bound's testing approach, indicate that per capita income is the most important determinant of rice import in Nigeria. The results further alludes that, the error correction mechanism (ECM) indicated a feedback of about 16.9 % of the previous year's disequilibrium from long-run wheat import.&nbsp; It is concluded that for the Nigerian government to reduce importation of rice in the face of increasing rice demand without exacerbating food security problem, then Nigeria should as a matter of urgency put in place policy measures that will significantly improve local rice production and processing. &nbsp; KEYWORDS: Rice, demand, import, SAP, ARDL, error correction mechanism, co-integration" ],

  "texts" : [ "Contesting citizenship: Civil society struggles over livelihood and educational access in coastal settlements of the Western Cape, South Africa", "This thesis examines how citizenship is being contested in post-apartheid South Africa\nthrough civil society struggles over livelihood and educational access in coastal settlements\nof the Western Cape. It contends that civil society activities represent a key site of learning\nand action towards expanding citizenship for marginalised groups. Citizenship from this\nperspective is both expressed in and influenced by civil society struggles, while being\nconstrained by external and structural forces such as globalisation and neo-liberal influences.\nThis thesis examines the interconnections between three key pillars of citizenship in this\ncontext – access to material or livelihood resources and opportunities, educational access and\ncapability requirements, and civil society contestation.\nStructural constraints continue to exist at national or policy level to ‘historically\ndisadvantaged’ (‘black’ and ‘coloured’) groups gaining full citizenship. Socio-economic and\neducational capability requirements are important exclusionary factors in terms of access to\nlivelihood resources and opportunities, including language and literacy requirements\noperating through bureaucratic or politically mediated processes. The analyses use the\nexample of marine resource access for small-scale, informal economy workers to\ndemonstrate these practices. In access to adult education and training opportunities, gaps and\ninequities in infrastructure and provision continue to form the major constraint. In both of\nthese strands of access, accountability of policy-makers, political leaders and decisionmakers\nis a key issue.\nCivil society activities represent one of the few available avenues for challenging inequities,\ndrawing on local action as well as international networks. Civil society efforts have resulted\nin some gains regarding access to marine resources and in pushing for recognition of\ncitizenship for small-scale fishers. This thesis argues that it is the contestation and\ncooperation that has occurred between civil society and government that creates the space in\nwhich citizenship has been expanded and contested, rather than civil society activities alone.\nUltimately, however, overcoming these challenges is likely to require wider interventions,\nincluding a more enabling policy environment and greater access to intermediate skills\ndevelopment." ],

  "title" : "Heterogeneity-awareness in multithreaded multicore processors",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Heterogeneity-awareness in multithreaded multicore processors", "During the last decades, Computer Architecture has experienced a great series of revolutionary changes. The increasing transistor count on a single chip has led to some of the main milestones in the field, from the release of the first Superscalar (1965) to the state-of-the-art Multithreaded Multicore Architectures, like the Intel Core i7 (2009).Moore's Law has continued for almost half of a century and is not expected to stop for at least another decade, and perhaps much longer. Moore observed a trend in the process technology advances. So, the number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively on an integrated circuit has increased exponentially, doubling approximately every two years. Nevertheless, having more available transistors can not be always directly translated into having more performance.The complexity of state-of-the-art software has reached heights unthinkable in prior ages, both in terms of the amount of computation and the complexity involved. If we deeply analyze this complexity in software we would realize that software is comprised of smaller execution processes that, although maintaining certain spatial/temporal locality, imply an inherently heterogeneous behavior. That is, during execution time the hardware executes very different portions of software, with huge differences in terms of behavior and hardware requirements. This heterogeneity in the behaviour of the software is not specific of the latest videogame, but it is inherent to software programming itself, since the very beginning of Algorithmics.In this PhD dissertation we deeply analyze the inherent heterogeneity present in software behavior. We identify the main issues and sources of this heterogeneity, that hamper most of the state-of-the-art processor designs from obtaining their maximum potential. Hence, the heterogeneity in software turns most of the current processors, commonly called general-purpose processors, into overdesigned. That is, they have much more hardware resources than really needed to execute the software running on them. This fact would not represent a main problem if we were not concerned on the additional power consumption involved in software computation.The final goal of this PhD dissertation consists in assigning each portion of software exactly the amount of hardware resources really needed to fully exploit its maximal potential; without consuming more energy than the strictly needed. That is, obtaining complexity-effective executions using the inherent heterogeneity in software behavior as steering indicator. Thus, we start deeply analyzing the heterogenous behaviour of the software run on top of general-purpose processors and then matching it on top of a heterogeneously distributed hardware, which explicitly exploit heterogeneous hardware requirements. Only by being heterogeneity-aware in software, and appropriately matching this software heterogeneity on top of hardware heterogeneity, may we effectively obtain better processor designs.The PhD dissertation is comprised of four main contributions that cover both multithreaded single-core (hdSMT) and multicore (TCA Algorithm, hTCA Framework and MFLUSH) scenarios, deeply explained in their corresponding chapters in the PhD dissertation memory. Overall, these contributions cover a significant range of the Heterogeneity-Aware Processors' design space. Within this design space, we have focused on the state-of-the-art trend in processor design: Multithreaded Multicore (CMP+SMT) Processors.We make special emphasis on the MPsim simulation tool, specifically designed and developed for this PhD dissertation. This tool has already gone beyond this PhD dissertation, becoming a reference tool by an important group of researchers spread over the Computer Architecture Department (DAC) at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC), the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) and the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (ULPGC)." ],

We propose a systematic requirements-driven approach for BP design and configuration management that uses requirements goal models to capture alternative process configurations and provides the ability to tailor deployed processes to changing business priorities or customer preferences (i.e., non-functional constraints)  by configuring their corresponding goal models at the goal level. A set of design time and runtime tools for configuring business processes implemented using WS-BPEL is provided, allowing to easily change the behaviour of deployed BP instances at a high level, based on business priorities and stakeholder preferences" ],

Treated shrimps packed in both vacuum and air package showed absence of melanosis throughout the storage. The biochemical quality of treated vacuum packed shrimps was better than the shrimps packed with normal air.

  "texts" : [ "Tax Savings as a Provision of Corporate Welfare is a State-Corporate Crime When it Becomes Socially Injurious", "This study focuses on the corporate welfare provided by the US government to corporations despite their high profits and argues that the significant and negative consequences to the federal and state tax bases of such welfare make it a state corporate crime.  Failure to stabilize or rollback corporate welfare initiatives has resulted in a significant decrease in the percentage of federal and state revenue that comes from corporate tax contributions.  I use structural equation modeling to analyze the consequences of corporate welfare initiatives on the federal tax base and the California state tax base.  Drawing insights from an integrated theory of state-corporate crime developed by Kauzlarich and Kramer (1998), I examine various forms of deviance and collusion between corporations and the federal government.  Specifically, this study explores this collusion on two levels: the structural and organizational levels. That is, I focus on the period before, during and after the implementation of corporate welfare initiatives and the organizational environment of the two groups involved.  This study reveals that the federal government facilitated state corporate crime in this case by continuing to provide tax breaks, investment incentives, and loans to corporations despite the high yield in corporate profits, declining corporate tax contributions, high delinquency rates on loans, and the continuous outsourcing of jobs. Because of the lack of government oversight, or deregulation, corporations were able to take advantage of the tax-exempt restructuring offered by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and Revenue Act of 1987, and tax credits beginning with Economic Recovery Act of 1981. This resulted in social harms that were associated with declining tax contributions to state and federal governments, namely a growing deficit, cutbacks in vital social services, and an increased tax burden among individual taxpayers." ],

  "title" : "Traffic locality oriented route discovery algorithms for mobile ad hoc networks",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Traffic locality oriented route discovery algorithms for mobile ad hoc networks", "There has been a growing interest in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) motivated by the advances in wireless technology and the range of potential applications that might be realised with such technology. Due to the lack of an infrastructure and their dynamic nature, MANETs demand a new set of networking protocols to harness the full benefits of these versatile communication systems. \nGreat deals of research activities have been devoted to develop on-demand routing algorithms for MANETs. The route discovery processes used in most on-demand routing algorithms, such as the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV), rely on simple flooding as a broadcasting technique for route discovery. Although simple flooding is simple to implement, it dominates the routing overhead, leading to the well-known broadcast storm problem that results in packet congestion and excessive collisions. A number of routing techniques have been proposed to alleviate this problem, some of which aim to improve the route discovery process by restricting the broadcast of route request packets to only the essential part of the network. Ideally, a route discovery should stop when a receiving node reports a route to the required destination. However, this cannot be achieved efficiently without the use of external resources; such as GPS location devices. \nIn this thesis, a new locality-oriented route discovery approach is proposed and exploited to develop three new algorithms to improve the route discovery process in on-demand routing protocols. The proposal of our algorithms is motivated by the fact that various patterns of traffic locality occur quite naturally in MANETs since groups of nodes communicate frequently with each other to accomplish common tasks. Some of these algorithms manage to reduce end-to-end delay while incurring lower routing overhead compared to some of the existing algorithms such as simple flooding used in AODV. The three algorithms are based on a revised concept of traffic locality in MANETs which relies on identifying a dynamic zone around a source node where the zone radius depends on the distribution of the nodes with which that the source is “mostly” communicating.\nThe traffic locality concept developed in this research form the basis of our Traffic Locality Route Discovery Approach (TLRDA) that aims to improve the routing discovery process in on-demand routing protocols. A neighbourhood region is generated for each active source node, containing “most” of its destinations, thus the whole network being divided into two non-overlapping regions, neighbourhood and beyond-neighbourhood, centred at the source node from that source node prospective. Route requests are processed normally in the neighbourhood region according to the routing algorithm used. However, outside this region various measures are taken to impede such broadcasts and, ultimately, stop them when they have outlived their usefulness. The approach is adaptive where the boundary of each source node’s neighbourhood is continuously updated to reflect the communication behaviour of the source node.\nTLRDA is the basis for the new three route discovery algorithms; notably: Traffic Locality Route Discovery Algorithm with Delay (TLRDA D), Traffic Locality Route Discovery Algorithm with Chase (TLRDA-C), and Traffic Locality Expanding Ring Search (TL-ERS). In TLRDA-D, any route request that is currently travelling in its source node’s beyond-neighbourhood region is deliberately delayed to give priority to unfulfilled route requests. In TLRDA-C, this approach is augmented by using chase packets to target the route requests associated with them after the requested route has been discovered. In TL-ERS, the search is conducted by covering three successive rings. The first ring covers the source node neighbourhood region and unsatisfied route requests in this ring trigger the generation of the second ring which is double that of the first. Otherwise, the third ring covers the whole network and the algorithm finally resorts to flooding. \nDetailed performance evaluations are provided using both mathematical and simulation modelling to investigate the performance behaviour of the TLRDA D, TLRDA-C, and TL-ERS algorithms and demonstrate their relative effectiveness against the existing approaches. Our results reveal that TLRDA D and TLRDA C manage to minimize end-to-end packet delays while TLRDA-C and TL-ERS exhibit low routing overhead. Moreover, the results indicate that equipping AODV with our new route discovery algorithms greatly enhance the performance of AODV in terms of end to end delay, routing overhead, and packet loss." ],

  "title" : "Rethinking sport teaching in physical education",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Rethinking sport teaching in physical education", "The purpose of this research was to describe and examine sport literacy in the context of secondary physical education and to investigate the limits, constraints and possibilities that physical education pre-service teachers' face when they attempt to take a progressive pedagogical approach to sport teaching on professional teaching practice. The literature informing the research suggested that evidence of learning is often absent from the physical education curriculum and discourses of physical education are marginalised.\r\nOne of the results of this research was to view sport literacy as an outcome of well thought out design, philosophy and practice that lead to progressive sport teaching in secondary school physical education. A curriculum that supports sport literacy is one that combines concepts from Teaching Games for Understanding (Bunker &Thorpe, 1982,1983) with Sport Education (Siedentop, 1994; Siedentop, Hastie & van der Mars, 2011). Such a curriculum delivers education through sport itself and through ideas and practices associated with sport. Pre-service teachers were taught about the design and practice of sport literacy when they undertook a physical education topic before doing their final professional teaching practice placement.\r\nThe pre-service teachers participated in the study over a six month period. The data collection occurred in four stages: 1. Investigation of a final year cohort of PETE-PS teachers observation and understanding of the important elements when teaching sport in physical education; 2. Investigation of the cohort of PETE-PS teachers responses to sport literacy from their perspective as learners of a sport and for its possibilities as a model that would support their sport teaching in physical education; 3a. Investigation of the cohort of pre-service teachers' experiences attempting to design and enact sport teaching in physical education while on professional teaching practice placement; 3b. Investigation of mentor teacher experiences with TGfU and Sport Education; and, 4. Interviews with pre-service teachers about the limits, constraints and possibilities of sport literacy.\r\nThe data suggested that Teaching Games for Understanding (TGfU) and Sport Education are unlikely to feature in the observation and understanding of physical education pre-service teachers in schools in South Australia. PETE is the site where pre-service teachers are most likely to be exposed to TGfU and Sport Education approaches. The data revealed preservice teachers were receptive to learning about sport literacy as a framework for teaching but working against the possibilities for sport literacy to inform sport teaching was the absence of examples of TGfU and Sport Education in practice in school settings. Mentor teachers mostly adhered to traditional behaviourist orientated textbook teachings aimed for little more than 'busy, happy, active' time (Placek, 1983). This prevented pre-service teachers from introducing different ideas during their professional teaching practice.\r\nSchools differ widely in terms of social context and complexity; however, sport teaching in physical education is delivered in similar fashion in South Australian secondary schools. Pre-service teachers are encouraged to conform to this community of practice when they undertake professional teaching practice placements. Teacher education programs might encourage graduates to be ambitious and develop expectations of being able to do things differently but these expectations are generally thwarted in the field where there appears to exist a process of hegemonic cultural reproduction which informs and shapes the pedagogical basis of sport curriculum content, and counters anything that confronts or attempts to re-shape the status quo.\r\nSparkes (2003) proposed that there are two types of learning communities; one where teachers work together to introduce innovations that will improve their teaching practices, and another where teachers agree to conform to traditional teaching practices. The evidence from this research suggests that the second is more likely to occur in South Australian secondary schools.\r\nThe data indicated pre-service teachers encountered difficulties translating the vision of sport teaching they were taught at university into the actual school curriculum. The analysis of the data created awareness of the pervasiveness of a normative discourse that mentor teachers communicated either covertly or overtly to pre-service teachers.\r\nThere are personal and institutional implications for PETE and the PETE educator to become agents of change. A new model for PETE (especially course work preparation and the teaching -professional teaching practice placement link) is necessary if PETE is to renew the curriculum and change the way sport teaching is undertaken." ],

We argue that bad products are hard to kill because firms face an inherent conflict when designing managers' incentives. Rewarding success encourages managers to forge ahead even when demand is low. To avoid investing in low-demand products, the firm must also reward decisions to kill products. However, rewarding managers for killing products effectively undermines the rewards for success. The inability to resolve this tension forces the firm to choose between paying an even larger bonus for success and accepting continued investment in low-demand products. We explore the boundaries of this argument by analyzing how the timing of demand information affects product investment decisions." ],

  "texts" : [ "Oman's Basic Statute and Human Rights: Protections and Restrictions with a focus on Nationality, Shura and Freedom of Association", "Over the last three decades, Oman has emerged as a center of political and economic stability in the Arab world, a stability which is an essential ingredient for any country to develop and flourish. Whereas democracy and public freedoms are at the core of stability in other parts of the world, the case in Oman is different. It is not a democratic state and it did not adopt the modern concepts of human rights and public freedoms into its legal-political system until 1996 when the Basic Statute of the State was promulgated. The purpose of this study is to provide a general view of the current status of Human Rights under the Omani Basic Statute of the State with a specific focus on some civil and political rights. It illustrates the situation of human rights by assessing the implementation of the constitutional and legal safeguards into practice and finding out what hinders them.  It aims to evaluate the importance of the constitution in Oman, and the extent to which it has succeeded in incorporating international human rights’ standards while walking the tightrope of reconciling this with core traditional social customs and Islamic values. It analyses the compatibility of constitutional and national laws and practice with international human rights standards and assesses current trends and policies. Three case studies for different rights and freedoms are conducted to explore the guarantees and weaknesses of different rights in practice. These are the areas of nationality 'as individual right' which is very important under the Oman system as it is the  direct  link to enjoyment of other rights and freedoms. The Shura  is the second case study as a political right or a collective right which represents public participation in Oman. Finally, the Freedom of Association, as an example for the freedom of expression and opinion, which represents individual and group rights together. This research evaluation analyses in detail the developments since the promulgation of the Basic Statute in December 1996 but stretches to encompass developments till the developments to the end of July 2011." ],

Assessment of fungal growth and invasion was by light- and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Viability counts of M. furfur were determined by a method of washing and serial dilution. Yeast cells had retained their viability and increased in number approximately twofold over a 4-day period of incubation. Yeast-to-hyphal transition was not achieved in this model.

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Progettazione di un sistema Steer by Wire e sperimentazione tramite banco Hardware in the Loop", "\"By-wire\" systems are characterized by the lack of mechanical link between the control device and the actuator, being it hydraulic or mechanical. The connection is replaced by a mechatronic system, equipped with redundant sensors and actuators [1]. SBW consists in two electro-mechanical actuators that steer the vehicle wheels and generate a resistance torque against the rotation of the steering wheel during cornering maneuvers. Each actuator is characterized by the presence of an electric motor, the first is connected to the pinion of the steering system, the other is connected to the steering wheel. The electric motor connected to the pinion is controlled in position and the command signal is generated by a PID controller. Reference position depends only on steering wheel angle and steering ratio. The torque control of the second electric motor is more difficult; the reference torque value has to be realistic in order to grant the proper feeling to the driver. The steering column is removed, as well as every hydraulic component that is part of the classic servo-assisted steering system. The logic that controls the system needs the information provided by two position sensors: one encoder is devoted to measure the steering wheel angular position, one linear position transducer measures the position of the rack [2]. The connection between the control units of the two sub-systems is realized through a communication bus. The aim of SBW technology is to completely remove as many mechanical components (steering shaft, column, gear reduction mechanism, etc.) as possible, thus simplifying the car interior design, increasing the driver safety in case of frontal crash. Moreover, active safety and handling are increased thanks to the variable ratio between steering wheel angle and tyres' steering angle, determined by a control logic [3]. SbW system's steering wheel has to generate a resistant torque which adds to the friction one. Such torque must be felt as natural by the average driver and carry information about vehicle dynamic condition. The paper describes the design of a SBW prototype, obtained from a classical steering system (see Fig.13) [4] [5]. A Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) test bench is also described: it is realized in order to test feedback torque generation and steering wheel efficiency influence on vehicle behavior. Actual steering wheel angle is used as input for a ten degrees of freedom model that calculates the vehicle dynamics, defining the steered wheels motion and the resistance torque at the pinion (see Fig.10). An analog signal is generated in order to control the steering wheel electric motor torque. Experimental tests are performed to optimize the feedback torque control. The reference torque is then calculated only using signals coming from vehicle on board sensors. Control logic is finally improved in order to stiffen the steering system unnaturally when lateral acceleration is about to reach adherence limit and prevent further steering action (see Fig.14)" ],

  "texts" : [ "3D virtual worlds as environments for literacy learning", "<b>Background:</b> Although much has been written about the ways in which new technology might transform educational practice, particularly in the area of literacy learning, there is relatively little empirical work that explores the possibilities and problems - or even what such a transformation might look like in the classroom. 3D virtual worlds offer a range of opportunities for children to use digital literacies in school, and suggest one way in which we might explore changing literacy practices in a playful, yet meaningful context.<p></p> <b>Purpose:</b> This paper identifies some of the key issues that emerged in designing and implementing virtual world work in a small number of primary schools in the UK. It examines the tensions between different discourses about literacy and literacy learning and shows how these were played out by teachers and pupils in classroom settings.<p></p><b>Sources of evidence:</b> Case study data are used as a basis for exploring and illustrating key aspects of design and implementation. The case study material includes views from a number of perspectives including classroom observations, chatlogs, in-world avatar interviews with teachers and also pupils, as well as the author’s field notes of the planning process with accompanying minutes and meeting documents.<p></p><b>Main argument:</b> From a Foucauldian perspective, the article suggests that social control of pedagogical practice through the regulation of curriculum time, the normalisation of teaching routines and the regimes of individual assessment restricts teachers’ and pupils’ conceptions of what constitutes literacy. The counternarrative, found in recent work in new litearcies (Lankshear & Knobel, 2006) provides an attractive alternative, but a movement in this direction requires a fundamental shift of emphasis and a re-conceptualisation of what counts as learning.<p></p><b>Conclusions:</b> This work on 3D virtual worlds questions the notion of how transformative practice can be achieved with the use of new technologies. It suggests that changes in teacher preparation, continuing professional development as well as wider educational reform may be needed." ],

  "title" : "On the programmability of heterogeneous massively-parallel computing systems",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "On the programmability of heterogeneous massively-parallel computing systems", "Heterogeneous parallel computing combines general purpose processors with accelerators to efficiently execute both sequential control-intensive and data-parallel phases of applications. Existing programming models for heterogeneous parallel computing impose added coding complexity when compared to traditional sequential shared-memory programming models for homogeneous systems. This extra code complexity is assumable in supercomputing environments, where programmability is sacrificed in pursuit of high performance. However, heterogeneous parallel systems are massively reaching the desktop market (e.g., 425.4 million of GPU cards were sold in 2009), where the trade-off between performance and programmability is the opposite. The code complexity required when using accelerators and the lack of compatibility prevents programmers from exploiting the full computing capabilities of heterogeneous parallel systems in general purpose applications. This dissertation aims to increase the programmability of CPU - accelerator systems, without introducing major performance penalties. The key insight is that general purpose application programmers tend to favor programmability at the cost of system performance. This fact is illustrated by the tendency to use high-level programming languages, such as C++, to ease the task of programming at the cost of minor performance penalties. Moreover, currently many general purpose applications are being developed using interpreted languages, such as Java, C# or python, which raise the abstraction level even further introducing relatively large performance overheads. This dissertation also takes the approach of raising the level of abstraction for accelerators to improve programmability and investigates hardware and software mechanisms to efficiently implement these high-level abstractions without introducing major performance overheads. Heterogeneous parallel systems typically implement separate memories for CPUs and accelerators, although commodity systems might use a shared memory at the cost of lower performance. However, in these commodity shared memory systems, coherence between accelerator and CPUs is not guaranteed. This system architecture implies that CPUs can only access system memory, and accelerators can only access their own local memory. This dissertation assumes separate system and accelerator memory and shows that low-level abstractions for these disjoint address spaces are the source of poor programmability of heterogeneous parallel systems. A first consequence of having separate system and accelerator memories are the current data transfer models for heterogeneous parallel systems. In this dissertation two data transfer paradigms are identified: per-call and double-buffered. In these two models, data structures used by accelerators are allocated in both, system and accelerator memories. These models differ on how data between accelerator and system memories is managed. The per-call model transfers the input data needed by accelerators before accelerator calls, and transfers back the output data produced by accelerators on accelerator call return. The per-call model is quite simple, but might impose unacceptable performance penalties due to data transfer overheads. The double-buffered model aims to overlap data communication and CPU and accelerator computation. This model requires a relative quite complex code due to parallel execution and the need of synchronization between data communication and processing tasks. The extra code required for data transfers in these two models is necessary due to the lack of by-reference parameter passing to accelerators. This dissertation presents a novel accelerator-hosted data transfer model. In this model, data used by accelerators is hosted in the accelerator memory, so when the CPU accesses this data, it is effectively accessing the accelerator memory. Such a model cleanly supports by-reference parameter passing to accelerator calls, removing the need to explicit data transfers. The second consequence of separate system and accelerator memories is that current programming models export separate virtual system and accelerator address spaces to application programmers. This dissertation identifies the double-pointer problem as a direct consequence of these separate virtual memory spaces. The double-pointer problem is that data structures used by both, accelerators and CPUs, are referenced by different virtual memory addresses (pointers) in the CPU and accelerator code. The double-pointer problem requires programmers to add extra code to ensure that both pointers contain consistent values (e.g., when reallocating a data structure). Keeping consistency between system and accelerator pointers might penalize accelerator performance and increase the accelerator memory requirements when pointers are embedded within data structures (e.g., a linked-list). For instance, the double-pointer problem requires increasing the numbers of global memory accesses by 2X in a GPU code that reconstructs a linked-list. This dissertation argues that a unified virtual address space that includes both, system and accelerator memories is an efficient solution to the double-pointer problem. Moreover, such a unified virtual address space cleanly complements the accelerator-hosted data model previously discussed. This dissertation introduces the Non-Uniform Accelerator Memory Access (NUAMA) architecture, as a hardware implementation of the accelerator-hosted data transfer model and the unified virtual address space. In NUAMA an Accelerator Memory Collector (AMC) is included within the system memory controller to identify memory requests for accelerator-hosted data. The AMC buffers and coalesces such memory requests to efficiently transfer data from the CPU to the accelerator memory. NUAMA also implements a hybrid L2 cache memory. The L2 cache in NUAMA follows a write-throughwrite-non-allocate policy for accelerator hosted data. This policy ensures that the contents of the accelerator memory are updated eagerly and, therefore, when the accelerator is called, most of the data has been already transferred. The eager update of the accelerator memory contents effectively overlaps data communication and CPU computation. A write-backwrite-allocate policy is used for the data hosted by the system memory, so the performance of applications that does not use accelerators is not affected. In NUAMA, accelerator-hosted data is identified using a TLB-assisted mechanism. The page table entries are extended with a bit, which is set for those memory pages that are hosted by the accelerator memory. NUAMA increases the average bandwidth requirements for the L2 cache memory and the interconnection network between the CPU and accelerators, but the instantaneous bandwidth, which is the limiting factor, requirements are lower than in traditional DMA-based architectures. The NUAMA architecture is compared to traditional DMA systems using cycle-accurate simulations. Experimental results show that NUAMA and traditional DMA-based architectures perform equally well. However, the application source code complexity of NUAMA is much lower than in DMA-based architectures. A software implementation of the accelerator-hosted model and the unified virtual address space is also explored. This dissertation presents the Asymmetric Distributed Shared Memory (ADSM) model. ADSM maintains a shared logical memory space for CPUs to access data in the accelerator physical memory but not vice versa. The asymmetry allows light-weight implementations that avoid common pitfalls of symmetrical distributed shared memory systems. ADSM allows programmers to assign data structures to performance critical methods. When a method is selected for accelerator execution, its associated data objects are allocated within the shared logical memory space, which is hosted in the accelerator physical memory and transparently accessible by the methods executed on CPUs. ADSM reduces programming efforts for heterogeneous parallel computing systems and enhances application portability. The design and implementation of an ADSM run-time, called GMAC, on top of CUDA in a GNU/Linux environment is presented. Experimental results show that applications written in ADSM and running on top of GMAC achieve performance comparable to their counterparts using programmer-managed data transfers. This dissertation presents the GMAC system, evaluates different design choices, and it further suggests additional architectural support that will likely allow GMAC to achieve higher application performance than the current CUDA model. Finally, the execution model of heterogeneous parallel systems is considered. Accelerator execution is abstracted in different ways in existent programming models. This dissertation explores three approaches implemented by existent programming models. OpenCL and the NVIDIA CUDA driver API use file descriptor semantics to abstract accelerators: user processes access accelerators through descriptors. This approach increases the complexity of using accelerators because accelerator descriptors are needed in any call involving the accelerator (e.g., memory allocations or passing a parameter to the accelerator). The IBM Cell SDK abstract accelerators as separate execution threads. This approach requires adding the necessary code to create new execution threads and synchronization primitives to use of accelerators. Finally, the NVIDIA CUDA run-time API abstract accelerators as Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). This approach is fundamentally incompatible with ADSM, because it assumes separate virtual address spaces for accelerator and CPU code. The Heterogeneous Parallel Execution (HPE) model is presented in this dissertation. This model extends the execution thread abstraction to incorporate different execution modes. Execution modes define the capabilities (e.g., accessible virtual address space, code ISA, etc) of the code being executed. In this execution model, accelerator calls are implemented as execution mode switches, analogously to system calls. Accelerator calls in HPE are synchronous, on the contrary of CUDA, OpenCL and the IBM Cell SDK. Synchronous accelerator calls provide full compatibility with the existent sequential execution model provided by most operating systems. Moreover, abstracting accelerator calls as execution mode switches allows application that use accelerator to run on system without accelerators. In these systems, the execution mode switch falls back to an emulation layer, which emulates the accelerator execution in the CPU. This dissertation further presents different design and implementation choices for the HPE model, in GMAC. The necessary hardware support for an efficient implementation of this model is also presented. Experimental results show that HPE introduces a low execution-time overhead while offering a clean and simple programming interface to applications." ],

A second aim was to compare survival rates of implants placed in healed versus fresh extraction sites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 113 consecutive patients about to have their maxillae rendered fully edentulous (mean extractions per patient: 6.7 teeth) received four to eight implants each (total number = 675) which were immediately placed in healed sites (323 implants, 47.9%) or fresh sockets (352 implants, 52.1%). Immediate loading of provisional prostheses was performed and all patients were followed up for 6 months. The success criteria included prosthesis success, assessment of individual implant stability and complications. RESULTS: No patients dropped out and all 113 patients received definitive fixed prostheses after 6 months of loading. The overall implant survival rate after 6 months was 99.1%. Six implants were lost in 6 patients (5.3%). Five of them were inserted in fresh extraction sockets (1.4%) and one in a healed site (0.3%). No significant difference (P = 0.1621) was found for implants placed in healed sites versus fresh extraction sites. Ten patients had fractures of the provisional prostheses as complications. CONCLUSIONS: Immediate implant placement and loading resulted in high implant as well as prosthetic survival rates. Placement in healed or fresh extraction bone sites may not influence implant survival." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Making Their Way-Making Art and Making Money: The working lives of visual artists with disabilities", "Abstract of Making Their Way—Making Art and Making Money: The working lives of visual artists with disabilities Susan Agatha Maley People with disabilities have marked lower rates of employment than people without disabilities in both Australia and the United States, the countries chosen for this research inquiry. That this is the case decades after the introduction of anti-discrimination laws in these developed democratic countries highlights the continuum of constraints people with disabilities still experience in securing work. Some of these constraints include socially discriminatory attitudes and perceptions, the lack of available accommodations and adaptations in work settings (and the misconception that they will be onerous and expensive to implement), lack of accessible transportation, the unavailability of work within established job markets and the restrictions of vocational rehabilitation and disability employment programs’ past focus on existing jobs in organisational settings. These constraints have a negative impact on the overall quality of life for many people with disabilities as employment is a key component to individual self-sufficiency and personal fulfilment and also crucial to inclusion in community and social settings. Among the notable initiatives to address these persistent inequities are research-informed projects focusing on self-employment as a viable alternative mode of employment to the established job market. Within the last decade, myriad research reports, model demonstration projects, and a US national research program, funded by the Office of Disability Employment Policy, have been demonstrating the success of self-employment in expanding self-determined income generation. Within this burgeoning and productive investigation on self-employment, one gap is that there has been little focused inquiry on creative work. Such a void is significant since the predominant work mode among visual artists is self-employment, albeit sometimes supplemented with other arts, and non-arts related work. This study addresses the lack of investigation of artists’ modes of work by examining the working lives of practicing professional visual artists with a range of significant physical, sensory and neurological disabilities. There are a number of reasons for this research study’s focus on the area of visual arts. Visual arts has been documented to be one of the largest groups among artistic disciplines in studies in both Australia and the US, as well as European countries. Within this sizable arts arena, there are established and emerging markets for sale of visual arts products. This discipline can also offer flexible work locations, hours and adaptations in art making. Thus, there may be numerous benefits to pursuing careers in the visual arts for creative people with disabilities. Yet, little is known about the lived work experience of practicing visual artists with disabilities and their career strategies. Thus, an exploration of visual artists with disabilities working in a range of mediums such as this research study can reveal new, and potentially useful, knowledge about their methods of art-making and marketing, adaptations in the design and execution of their work, their experiences of disability and the facilitators and obstacles they face when preparing for and pursuing their working lives as artists. This research study is based on the results of in-depth, face-to-face interviews of twenty-one visual artists, eleven in Australia and ten in the US, who used multiple artistic mediums. The conceptual lens for the analysis is intersectionality with an underlying critical realism foundation. These theories were used to explore the intersecting social positions of being a person with a disability and a practicing artist and the related interplay of agency and structure in shaping the careers of these artists. The main findings from this research focus on how the artists in this study made their way, made art and made money. These findings commence with an examination of the early shaping and continued sustaining influences in their artistic development and education. It continues with an exploration of the influence of their disability experiences on making art including their adaptive methods and conceptual process. The analysis continues with a focus on factors involving their means of making money, marketing and self-promotion methods and professional progressions. The findings conclude with an analysis of aids and obstacles these artists with disabilities experienced during interactions with a range of organisations including disability employment and vocational rehabilitation counselling and financial support agencies, arts educational institutions, art galleries and arts and disability agencies. Highlights of the findings are that the majority of the artists in the study earned their income from arts and arts related work, that they made active use of their own personal and collective agency to meet their artistic and professional goals and that their actions influenced structural change. They also positioned aspects of their social and personal identity to best suit their career progressions and some made artistic use of their conceptions of disability with innovative impact on social conceptions of disability. Implications of these findings are that artists experiencing disability developed strategic skills to negotiate difficult terrain while forging an income-producing arts practice. In addition, their creation of new options for themselves, and other artists with disabilities, has wider implications for improving equity for artists with disabilities." ],

  "title" : "Financing and internationalization of R&D intensive firms",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Financing and internationalization of R&D intensive firms", "Knowledge and knowledge-based value creation processes play an increasing role in modern economies. In the last two decades investments in knowledge have gained importance relative to investments in physical assets. The OECD reports that private and public investments in knowledge as percentage of GDP have increased by 0.7 percentage points in OECD countries during the years 1997-2004. At the same time, investments in physical assets such as machinery and equipment have decreased by 1.1 percentage points. The increasing importance of intangible assets in the value creation process presents a significant challenge for innovation policies in knowledge-based economies. Innovative firms that intensely invest in research and development (R&D) highly rely on intangible assets and are faced with serious market failures. These frictions can restrict R&D intensive firms' innovation and internationalization activities and are expected to hamper overall technological progress and economic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nImperfect financial markets that are characterized by information asymmetries can restrict the access to finance for R&D intensive start-up firms. These firms have only short track records and due to their focus on R&D, they have only few tangible assets that can be used as collateral for financial investors. Thus, financial frictions are particularly severe for new firms and firms undertaking innovative activities (Hall and Lerner, 2009). At the same time, young and small firms significantly contribute to technological progress and economic growth (OECD, 2013). Financial constraints restrain the innovation activities of these firms and result in an overall decelerated rate of innovation and a slowdown in economic progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther, R&D intensive firms additionally face the problem that their created knowledge exhibits the characteristics of public goods. Once information on inventions is revealed, the knowledge is non-rival and non-excludable. A sufficient patent protection is necessary to maintain investment incentives and to overcome problems of underinvestment. In their internationalization strategy, R&D intensive firms have to consider that patent law is a territorial concept, i.e., the scope of patent protection is limited to the territory of the country where the right is granted. The foundation of a foreign affiliate represents a transaction, whereby sensitive knowledge is transferred outside the firm and intangible assets are exposed to a high risk of infringement. A lacking or insufficient patent protection in host countries can distort global investment decisions and prevent profitable projects. Particularly R&D intensive multinational firms that intensely rely on intangible assets are expected to be highly affected by these frictions. Distorted investments could adversely affect a firm's growth and restrict the technological progress in host countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis dissertation attempts to shed more light onto these market imperfections, which are aggravated by firms' reliance on intangible assets and are expected to adversely affect firms' innovation and internationalization strategy. The first two chapters deal with frictions in financial markets. Chapter 1 takes a step back and investigates how access to finance can be precisely measured. A precise measurement is essential to design effective policy measures in order to foster access to finance. On the basis of these findings, Chapter 2 considers the access to external finance of R&D intensive start-up firms and empirically investigates whether patents can mitigate financial frictions of these innovative firms. The third chapter considers frictions in the internationalization strategies of R&D intensive firms. It empirically investigates, whether a strengthening of national patent law affects the global investment decision of multinationals and encourages foreign direct investment.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first chapter is concerned with the empirical methodology of measuring access to finance. Measuring and identifying financial constraints represents an important challenge in empirical studies. Due to data limitations, access to finance has often been approximated by the usage of finance or by perception-based indicators. However, these types of measures disregard firm-specific differences in the demand for external finance. Firms that do not use external finance can either be financially constrained or might have no demand for external finance. Similarly, firms reporting that they do not face problems with access to finance may either have sufficient access or may have no financial demand. \r\n\r\n\r\nUsing unique firm-level survey data which provides information on a firm's demand for credit, we develop a direct measure of access to credit. This measure takes into account whether a firm that has credit demand is successful in obtaining access to credit. In the first part of the analysis, we use our direct measure to estimate the determinants of access to credit. Thereby, we can separate the determinants affecting credit demand from those affecting access. In the second part, we estimate the determinants affecting the usage of credit and the perceived access respectively. A comparison of the identified determinants with those from the access estimation reveals whether the approximating measures allow for a precise identification of credit constraints. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe find that the usage of credit is not adequate to identify financially constrained firms, since the determinants of demand and the determinants of access are not disentangled in the usage measure. Perception based indicators, however, are found to be surprisingly precise, even when information on demand is not available. Based on these findings, recommendations for future survey design for investigating access to finance are drawn. Our results imply that including questions on the demand for external finance is essential to identify access to finance. Further, since firms can be discouraged from applying, information on the application for finance is not sufficient and reasons for why firms have not applied for external finance should be additionally considered. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe contribute to the literature by evaluating whether the usage of credit is a suitable approximation for access to credit and whether perception-based indicators provide precise measurements of credit constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical evaluation of these measures. A precise measure of access to finance is essential for drawing correct policy recommendations from economic research and to design efficient policy measures with the aim of fostering access to finance.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second chapter turns to the financing of R&D intensive start-up firms. It investigates the role of patents in their external finance and examines whether patents can improve the access to external financing for innovative start-up firms. Patents have the potential to reduce information asymmetries between patentees and investors (Long, 2002) and can also be seen as a type of property rights, since patents are fully transferable as well as exclusive and binding against third parties (Davies, 2006).\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing detailed firm-level survey data of German start-up firms, we identify a firm's financial demand for venture capital and bank financing and investigate whether a firm that has demand for a particular source of finance is successful in obtaining it. To measure a firm's patenting activity and to distinguish high valuable patents, we use value-weighted patent counts that are based on the direct valuations by the patent owners. Instrumental-variable estimations take into account the potential endogeneity of patenting and establish a causal effect of patents. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe analysis reveals two important findings. First, we find strong evidence for its endogeneity and provide a possible instrumentation strategy for patenting. Ignoring the endogeneity of patenting can result in highly biased estimates. Second, our results indicate that patenting significantly increases the probability of using venture capital and bank financing, especially when the values of patents are considered. However, it is not clear whether an increase in the usage of external finance can be fully attributed to an improved access to finance or whether part of the increase is due to an increased financial demand of patenting firms. Using separate measures for demand and access, we can clearly identify a demand driven effect of patents. Patenting firms have a significantly higher demand for external finance, while, after controlling for financial demand, no effect on access to external finance has been found.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe contribution of the second chapter is primarily methodical. For future research on the financial role of patents, our findings emphasize the importance of considering endogeneity issues of patenting and controlling for firm-specific differences in financial demand. We can show that a large part of the increase in the usage of external finance can be attributed to a significantly higher financial demand of patenting firms. This leads to the question, whether the findings in the previous literature on the usage of external finance can be fully attributed to a signaling effect of patents or whether the identified effect is driven by a higher financial demand of patenting firms. Further, most previous studies on the role of patents in financing have not considered issues of endogeneity. Taking into account our results, it is not clear whether previous findings can be interpreted as causal effects or mere correlations. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe third chapter deals with frictions due to a lack of patent protection and empirically investigates the role of patent protection in the global investment decisions of German multinationals. Using a firm-level panel dataset on the universe of German outward foreign direct investment (FDI), we investigate individual firm-level investment decisions at the extensive and intensive margin of FDI. At the extensive margin, we explore the impact of patent protection on the decision where to locate a foreign affiliate. At the intensive margin, we analyze how the strengthening of patent rights affects the size of the established affiliates and the ownership share held in the foreign affiliates. To isolate the effect of patent protection, we exploit variation of patent protection across countries and time, as well as variation of the dependency on patent protection across sectors and time. A firm's dependency on patent protection is approximated by sector-specific measures of R&D intensity and the perceived effectiveness of patent protection for protecting innovation. By conditioning on an extensive set of fixed effects, we account for unobserved firm- and country-specific heterogeneity and capture potential omitted variable bias. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe find that patent protection affects German foreign direct investment in different ways. Strengthening patent protection positively affects the location decision of German multinationals. Furthermore, we find significant nonlinear effects in a host country's initial legal and economic development. With regard to the intensive margin, we find some evidence for a positive effect of patent protection. However, the effect is much weaker than for the location decision. For the ownership shares held in foreign affiliates, we find that average ownership shares increase significantly after strengthening patent protection.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe analysis complements and contributes to the previous literature on the relation between intellectual property right (IPR) protection and FDI in different manners. It provides the first firm-level evidence on German multinationals. Insights into how German multinationals are affected by international patent protection are particularly interesting, since Germany is second in the ranking of FDI outward countries (UNCTAD, 2011). Further, the analysis provides a strong identification strategy that allows for nonlinear effects of patent protection and considers various sources of omitted variable bias. Additionally, we take into account host countries' previous levels of legal and economic development, which enables us to draw more precise policy recommendations for reforming countries. Finally, the analysis provides a comprehensive firm-level analysis of FDI decisions at various levels of FDI, something which has been missing in previous research." ],

  "texts" : [ "OMake: Designing a Scalable Build Process", "Modern software codebases are frequently large, heterogeneous, and constantly evolving.  The languages and tools for software construction, including code builds and configuration management, have not been well-studied.  Developers are often faced with using 1) older tools (like make) that do not scale well, 2) custom build scripts that tend to be fragile, or 3) proprietary tools that are not portable.\n\nIn this paper, we study the build issue as a domain-specific programming problem.  There are a number of challenges that are unique to the domain of build systems.  We argue that a central goal is compositionality---that is, it should be possible to specify a software component in isolation and add it to a project with an assurance that the global specification will not be compromised.  The next important goal is to cover the full range of complexity---from allowing very concise specifications for the most common cases to providing the flexibility to encompass projects with unusual needs. Dependency analysis, which is a prerequisite for incremental builds, must be automated in order to achieve compositionality an reliability; it also spans the full range of complexity.\n\nWe develop a language for describing software builds and\nconfiguration.  We also develop an implementation (called OMake), that addresses all the above challenges efficiently and portably. It also provides a number of features that help streamline the edit/compile development cycle.\n\nOMake is freely available under the GNU General Public License, and is actively being used in several large projects." ],

  "title" : "Systems biology and cancer, [Editorial]",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Systems biology and cancer, [Editorial]", "The systems approach to complex biological problems has rapidly gained ground during the first decade of this century. There are several reasons for this development. An important one is that while the achievement of sequencing the complete human genome, and those of other species, has been of great benefit to fundamental science, for example in comparative genomics and evolutionary biology, it has not led to the expected quick and simple solutions to multifactorial diseases (2010). On the contrary, cancer, cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic and nervous diseases have all been resistant to reductionist analysis. In the case of cancer the hope that by identifying what are called oncogenes we would not only understand cancer but be led naturally to its cure has not been fulfilled ([Sonnenschein and Soto, 1999] and [Sonnenschein and Soto, 2011]). In all areas of medical science, despite the identification of hundreds more potential targets by genome sequencing, the pharmaceutical industry has been faced with a decline in the production of new successful drugs. The more we find out about the fundamental elements of biology, the DNA, RNAs, proteins, metabolites, membrane systems, organelles, the more puzzling the picture becomes. Even central biological concepts, like that of a gene, have changed and have even become difficult to define (Beurton et al., 2008 In: P.J. Beurton, R. Falk and H.-J. Rheinberger, Editors, The Concept of the Gene in Development and Evolution: Historical and Epistemological Perspectives, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge (2008).Beurton et al., 2008).\r\n\r\nReassessment of the fundamental concepts of biological science is therefore necessary. This is happening in all fields, including genetics (Beurton et al., 2008), evolution ([Pigliucci and Müller, 2010], [Gissis and Jablonka, 2011] and [Shapiro, 2011]), cancer (Soto et al., 2008), development and the relationships between genomes and phenotypes ([Noble, 2011b] and [Noble, 2011a]). What once were heresies seem to be creeping back into mainstream biology.\r\n\r\nOne of the driving forces of this development is the use of mathematical modelling in systems biology. This has brought a rigorous quantitative approach to what otherwise would be largely untestable theories. Mathematical models provide a framework in which to interpret the vast amount of experimental data generated on a daily basis and to suggest subsequent experiments necessary to test theories. The traditional verbal reasoning approach is not appropriate in many cases due to the complexity of biology (Gatenby and Maini, 2003) which renders intuition insufficient as results are often counter-intuitive, a characteristic outcome of scientific research that goes as far back as Copernicus’ proposal of an heliocentric planetary system. This vast complexity requires a mathematical approach.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this focussed issue of the journal is that the field of cancer is ripe for the systems biology approach. As editors we have collected an eclectic mix of articles. This is not a ‘one view fits all’ approach. It is rather one to ‘let a hundred flowers bloom’. At this stage in our understanding we cannot be sure where the next big insights are going to come from.\r\n\r\nSince the 18th century biologists and philosophers tried to define the place of biology1 in science and in particular its relationship with physics. A two hundred year debate followed, with biologists adopting “physicalist” or “vitalistic” stands. Was life to be explained in a totally materialistic way by the laws of physics? Or were there additional “forces” present in the living matter but absent in the inert one? Curiously, as vitalism dwindled among biologists in the 20th century, physicists like Schrödinger (1944) and Elsasser (1987) were the ones that tried to understand biological order and were prepared to find new laws that applied only to living matter.2 No new laws resulted from this search, but from the emerging field of information theories, biologists adopted information as the metaphor for the study of biological organization.3 This, however, has not produced the desired effects either, probably because the attempts to formalize this approach failed, which in turn suggests that it was conceptually wrong. Can biology achieve formalization through mathematics, a feat that physics has accomplished so successfully?\r\n\r\nThe article by Giuseppe Longo and Mael Montevil (2011) (mathematicians), analyzes the principles of intelligibility in physics, which is based on symmetries, and posit that the role of symmetries in biology is different: in their words “the permanent change of symmetries …per se modifies the analysis of the internal and external processes of life, both in ontogenesis and evolution”. They propose to consider the roles played by local and global symmetry changes, along extended critical transitions. According to them, the mathematization of this state of extended criticality may provide the adequate frame to understand biological complexity. Paul-Antoine Miquel (2011) (a philosopher), reflects on the philosophical aspects of the theoretical analysis by Longo and Montevil and concludes that “the philosophical key point for us is that they (Longo and Montevil) interpret this mathematical space in which anti-entropy is realized in biological criticality as an extension of the classical physical theoretical frameworks.” These two contributions aim at improving our understanding on why the principles governing living organisms are different from those defining the physicality of inanimate objects and provide a conceptual frame of reference and a point of departure for constructing a mathematics for biology.\r\n\r\nStuart Baker (a bio-statistician) and Barnett Kramer (a cancer epidemiologist) (2011) evaluate the potential contributions of different approaches to Systems Biology when applied to uncover buried messages in the genesis of cancer which may set new trends in research and in ways to benefit patients. They anticipate both promises and perils in applying systems biology to cancer. The great promise of systems biology comes from the idea that studying a system can provide information not available by separately studying the workings of each part. However, they perceive a divide between systems biology based on the principles of biology or biophysics, systems biology related to statistics, bioinformatics, and reverse engineering, and systems biology involving clinical predictions, sometimes without full appreciation of other viewpoints. The peril comes when the rules leading to a complex system vary over many components and the sample sizes are limited for identifying the rules and making predictions. Baker et al. have introduced the concept of “paradigm instability” when referring to current state of affairs through which the field of cancer research is traversing. Thus, they focus on a number of paradoxes that exist in this field and cautiously point at ways that might increase knowledge about the disease and also benefit patients.\r\n\r\nSimon Rosenfeld (2011) (a mathematical physicist) makes a critical analysis of the assumptions and concepts used in the emerging field of network biology, particularly those on the actual physics and chemistry happening inside cells. He posits that, in biology there is dual causality, that is, in addition to the constraints imposed by the laws of nature, there is the evolutionary history of the organism: “…inherent dynamical instability represents the natural laws and physico-chemical principles whereas biological robustness is the result of evolutionary history in which this dynamical instability has been effectively used for gaining evolutionary advantages and survival.” He subscribes to the notion that “Mathematics represents a systematic and orderly way of describing and organizing knowledge. In the majority of scientific disciplines, mathematical reasoning has proven to be an unparalleled and indispensable tool for understanding complex dynamics.” He forcefully argues for adopting a Systems Biology approach to resolve complex biological problems while complying with a comprehensive evolutionary perspective.\r\n\r\nPlankar et al. (2011) challenge the genetically determined paradigm of cancer from another angle to characterise cancer as the result of impaired coherence leading to progressive destabilisation of molecular and gene regulatory networks. As they write in their conclusion “It is becoming clear that even with potentially unlimited insight into the dynamics of genetic changes, cancer could not be sufficiently explained, and neither could it be explained in terms of separate linear molecular pathways alone. During the last decade, scientific attention has turned dramatically towards the metabolic, bioenergetic, developmental, and systems biology aspects of cancer, reflecting a gradual paradigm shift towards its non-genetic origin.”\r\n\r\nEnderling and Hahnfeldt (2011) analyse the dynamics of a growing solid tumour composed of cancer stem cells and cancer non-stem cells using a simple hybrid cellular automaton (CA) model. They illustrate the counter-intuitive finding that increasing the rate of apoptosis, while obviously reducing tumour size in the short-term, actually enhances growth in the long-term. They show that tumours can remain dormant for a long time but stimulation of apoptosis can cause the tumour cell population to aggressively invade. Their work suggests that the widely regarded “evading cell death” as a hallmark of cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000) needs to be revisited.\r\n\r\nKim et al. (2011) begin by reviewing the interactions between a tumour and its microenvironment, highlighting how this plays an important role in the transition from benign or pre-malignant tumour to invasive cancer. They then describe a continuum model for the mechanics of a growing tumour in three spatial dimensions, and use it to investigate the effects on tumour growth of agarose gel inhomogeneities and other microenvironmental factors. This framework is extended to explore ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in which the stroma is modelled as a continuum but the cells of the tumour are modelled discretely. The mechanical model is coupled to the biochemistry via a system of reaction–diffusion equations which describe the dynamics of key signalling factors. This multiscale model is solved numerically and effects of perturbing the system mechanically or biochemically are illustrated. This approach allows us to begin to understand the outcome of the nonlinear interactions of some of the fundamental processes involved in tumour growth, with the potential to then consider methods to control growth and spread.\r\n\r\nGerlee and Anderson (2011) focus on mechanisms present in organisms that allow it, or parts of it, to maintain a given shape or architecture (structural homeostasis). They consider a hybrid CA model for a two-dimensional mono-layer of cells which may, for example, approximate the epithelial lining of an organ. In their model, each cell has an intracellular network which integrates the cues a cell receives from its microenvironment (for example nutrients or growth factors, whose dynamics are modelled by reaction-diffusion equations) and other cells and determines the response of the cell, in terms of its behaviour or phenotype. The problem is then reduced to finding a set of network parameters (or genotype) which maximises a fitness function such that structural homeostatis is attained. Perturbations of the system, such as wounding or mutation, are investigated.\r\n\r\nVera et al. (2011) present an in-depth review which focuses on JAK-STAT (Janus kinase – signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway in the context of cancer. This pathway plays a fundamental role in growth control, cell differentiation and maintenance of tissue homeostasis, and its dysregulation plays an important role in tumourigenesis. They review the biology of the pathway and then survey systems biology approaches that have helped elucidate the dynamics of the pathway under physiological and diseased states.\r\n\r\nScianna et al., (2011) address the multiple levels of organisation involved in vascularisation, an important step enabling tumour growth and the formation of metastases. Their work forms an innovative multiscale hybrid framework within which to test potential anti-angiogenic strategies in treating cancer.\r\n\r\nInsuk Lee (2011) presents a holistic model of genes as a collaborative society. To the standard approaches involving protein–protein interaction networks (PPIN) and transcriptional regulatory networks (TRN) he adds the probabilistic functional gene network (PFGN) to show how robustness can arise despite noisy genomics data. Mapping epistatic interactions between genes is identified as the key way to understanding the genetic organisation of complex traits. Amongst the applications of this approach he considers epistatic interactions between hub cancer genes such as p53.\r\n\r\nKeith Baverstock (2011) uses models of cell regulation to address the important question of whether regulatory networks are hard wired into the genome or whether they are better represented as open systems involving an attractor interacting with the environment. In the latter case, environmental stress can trigger inherited transitions in the phenotype without necessarily involving DNA sequence changes. The second type of model works best. As he says “the power of the model lies in its ability to make evident how it is that a rigid and highly conserved coding sequence in DNA, the genotype, can give rise to phenotypic plasticity and responsiveness to environment” and that it helps to understand “the origins of non-genetic somatic and inherited disease, arising from switches to variant attractors representing phenotypes with abnormal characteristics.” The relevance to diseases like cancer is obvious.\r\n\r\nTaken as a whole, this set of articles not only challenges some of the current paradigms, but also lays the groundwork for alternative approaches and in many cases takes those approaches further towards the goal of understanding cancer as a systems-level process." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Structure, Rhetoric, Imagery: Intersections of Literary Expression and Musical Narrative in the Vocal Works of Beethoven", "Beethoven’s vocal works are often neglected or overshadowed as a result of his prominent involvement with large-scale instrumental genres such as sonata, symphony, or string quartet. Nevertheless, he sustained throughout his life a significant interest in literature and poetry; his personal library, as well as his letters, Tagebuch, and conversation books all document this by way of numerous direct quotations from—and indirect references to—the literary materials that interested him. The numerous vocal works he produced between 1783 and 1826 are one relevant manifestation of this interest and engagement with words. Beethoven produced a significant body of vocal works, the majority of which have not received the same intensity of analytical treatment as the instrumental works. Specifically, this study examines the relationship between words and music in the solo songs and other vocal works of Beethoven. The points of intersection between literary and musical expression are evaluated within four aspects of text setting: structure, rhythm, meaning, and narrative. Firstly, elements of derivation and deviation are explored to determine the diverse ways that he deliberately constructed musical structures in response to the poetic (and semantic) structures of each source text. Secondly, and by extension, rhythm and metre—and varying degrees of derivation, deviation, and manipulation—are assessed so as to demonstrate how these works illustrate Beethoven’s awareness of the expressive possibilities for adhering to or altering the relationship between poetic and musical metre.Thirdly, various types of musical rhetoric—including Beethoven’s implementation of the conventions for affective tonality, as well as the reliance on both conventional and uniquely-Beethovenian depictive idioms and gestures—illustrate his response to various levels of semantic content. Fourthly, his response to individual (though interrelated) aspects of narrative in his selected texts are evaluated. Drawing concepts from key figures of narrative theory—including Gérard Genette, Roland Barthes, Mieke Bal, and others—this study assesses the narrative content in selected texts as a means by which to gauge Beethoven’s compositional response to aspects of temporality, focalisation, spatiality, and so forth, both individually and in combination. Ultimately, this study demonstrates that—contrary to frequently voiced opinions—Beethoven responded quite closely and deliberately to the expressive implications of his selected texts, while aspects of poetic and musical structure, rhythm, syntax, imagery, and layers of meaning coalesce within complex narrative processes. Beethoven was aware of the inherent musicality of poetic texts and the significance of forging a close compositional relationship between words and music; thus he consistently demonstrated in composing these works his ideology that within vocal works ‘words and music form a unit’." ],

  "texts" : [ "Shaping the identity of peripheral art museums in Israel during the nineties", "The aim of this study is to explore the process that shaped the identity of peripheral art museums in Israel during decade the 1990s. This process is examined though the eyes of the curators who artistically guided and directed two of these museums, the Janco Dada Museum in Ein Hod and the Ein Harod Museum of Art at Kibbutz Ein Harod. Both museums are non-profit organizations and this study is the first to seek to understand the identity of these two small but significant art museums located in villages in the north of Israel. The research examines the meaning of the identity of the museums by drawing upon theories of museology, centre and periphery, personal and group identity and organization identity. This research is based on knowledge that is personal, unique and subjective. It is conducted using an inductive approach towards gathering, analysing and interpreting data. The research utilizes a case study approach in order to provide an explanation for the cultural organization of the museum and for the attitude of the curators. This is documentary research that is based on only one source, the museum's archives which are examined according to multi- method procedures for gathering data. The evidence showed that in both cases the process of constructing the identity of the art museums links the personal views as well as the professional aims of the curators and their activities. These activities link the identity of the art museum to the natural setting. In addition, these activities, in both cases, link the identity of the museum to the relationship of the centre and periphery. In addition, both curators wished to differentiate their museum from the centre. In the research process new links were created between diverse scientific disciplines such as museology and social science and theories derived from different fields such as art history, sociology, and centre and periphery studies. These links, contribute new insights into our understanding of museology." ],

The majority of these studies have looked at the buffering effects of religiosity against depression and the positive association between a religious worldview and wellbeing. A primary understanding of this relationship has been that religiosity increases one's ability to cope with life's stress as well as make meaning out of suffering yet little research has been done with survivors of trauma, a population at increased risk for mental illness. Furthermore, there is evidence that the pathway to developing the protective buffer of intrinsic religiosity inherently includes periods of depression and spiritual searching which serve as the catalyst for the process yet it is not well understood how trauma may impact this development. The primary aims of this study are to investigate the relationship between religiosity and depression in adult survivors of childhood physical and sexual abuse across several religious and spiritual dimensions. Results suggest that 1) In the overall sample, high attendance and high religious faith importance are protective against a diagnosis of depression while high spiritual life importance, having a religious experience, childhood physical abuse, and childhood sexual abuse are associated with a depression diagnosis; 2) For individuals without a reported abuse history, high attendance and high religious faith importance are protective against depression while having a religious experience and rating one's spiritual life as highly important were shown to be associated with depression; 3) Childhood physical abuse significantly impacts the protective relationship between high attendance and depression diagnosis and high religious faith importance and depression diagnosis and survivors of childhood physical abuse who also rated their religious faith as important and reported high attendance were more likely to have a depression diagnosis; 4) When childhood physical abuse survivors endorse strongly agreeing that their religious/spiritual beliefs are a guide to daily living they are less likely to have a diagnosis of depression; 5) In survivors of childhood sexual abuse, high religious faith importance and being led spiritually are protective against a depression diagnosis" ],

Our quantitative analysis of diphthongization in real time examines both the trajectory of this change through the community as well as individual speakers’ participation in it across their lifespans. Our study also provides acoustic measurements of the Montreal French vowel system.We tracked individuals’ vowel trajectories across a 24-year span for a panel of six speakers of diverse social classes. Matched trend samples from the 1971 and 1984 Montreal corpora, with four speakers sampled per year, provide a picture of the community as a whole. We find that the vowels [i:, y:, E:, and œ:] show significant lowering and/or backing in the community, and that all long vowels show decreased diphthongization. Some panel speakers’ longitudinal movements mirror these changes, while other speakers are stable across their lifespans and still others show apparently anomalous movements. We discuss these results and their interpretation." ],

After the study display, participants have to decide which of two shapes in a match display was seen before in the study display. STVM has been used by Vecera, Vogel, and Woodman (2002) to demonstrate that the lower region is a figure-ground cue. In our modified version of STVM, the study stimulus was preceded by a brief prime. This caused a biasing of the figural interpretation of the ambiguous figure-ground displays that contained the lower region cue. We show that 100-msec priming with an unambiguous display is enough to affect the subsequent interpretation of the ambiguous figure-ground display. It takes maximally 350 msec to complete a transition from the nondominant interpretation to the dominant interpretation of an ambiguous figure-ground display that contains the lower region cue." ],

  "texts" : [ "\"The New Development of Dispersed Production System: A Case from the Japanese Toy Industry in the Inter-war Period\" (in Japanese)", "This paper explores Japan's pre-war industrialization from the viewpoint of small- scale businesses. A typical case can be seen in the development of rural weaving industry before the World War I. There functioned the production form besides factory such as putting-out system based on the peasant's sideline work. After the World War I, however, putting-out system in the weaving industry rapidly gave way to factory system that equipped the power looms. Contrastively, the industrial development in large cities, especially in Tokyo during the Inter-war period, entailed the increase of newly formed petty and small workshops. There functioned the production system based on the complex transaction of merchants, factories, small workshops and domestic works. Toy manufacturing, which developed as an export industry in the Inter-war Tokyo, was one of the typical industries based on that production system. As the urban area lacked the peasants and the intimate communities, urban small businesses stood on the different foundations. The skill was trained in the quasi-apprentice system where juvenile workers experienced a sort of on the job training. Based on this skill formation, not a few employees set up their own businesses and competed even with the wholesalers. Their activities were supported by the positive externality of the cluster. The formal and informal institutions played significant roles to prevent the transactions from disorder. The role of production organizer that combined the function of the merchant was also important. The combination of the merchant and the household economy, together with the social and institutional basis, promoted an industrialization based on the small businesses." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Knowledge, attitudes and practices in travel-related infectious diseases: the European airport survey", "BACKGROUND: The European Travel Health Advisory Board conducted a cross-sectional pilot survey to evaluate current travel health knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) and to determine where travelers going to developing countries obtain travel health information, what information they receive, and what preventive travel health measures they employ. Subsequently, the questionnaire used was improved and a cross-sectional, multicenter study was undertaken in airports in Europe, Asia, South Africa and the United States. This paper describes the methods used everywhere, and results from the European airports. METHOD: Between September 2002 and September 2003, 5,465 passengers residing in Europe and boarding an intercontinental flight to a developing country were surveyed at the departure gates of nine major airports in Europe. Questionnaires were self-administered, and checked for completeness and validated by trained interviewers. RESULTS: Although the majority of travelers (73.3%) had sought general information about their destination prior to departure, only just over half of the responders (52.1%) had sought travel health advice. Tourists and people traveling for religious reasons had sought travel health advice more often, whereas travelers visiting friends and relatives were less likely to do so. Hepatitis A was perceived as the most probable among the infectious diseases investigated, followed by HIV and hepatitis B. In spite of a generally positive attitude towards vaccines, 58.4% and 68.7% of travelers could not report any protection against hepatitis A or hepatitis B, respectively. Only one in three travelers to a destination country with at least some malaria endemicity were carrying antimalarial drugs. Almost one in four travelers visiting a high-risk area had an inaccurate risk perception and even one in two going to a no-risk destination were unnecessarily concerned about malaria. CONCLUSIONS: The large variation in destinations, age of the travelers and reasons for traveling illustrates that traveling to a developing country has become common practice. The results of this large-scale airport survey clearly demonstrate an important educational need among those traveling to risk destinations. Initiatives to improve such education should target all groups of travelers, including business travelers, those visiting friends and relatives, and the elderly. Additionally, travel health advice providers should continue their efforts to make travelers comply with the recommended travel health advice. Our common objective is to help travelers stay healthy while abroad, and consequently to also reduce the potential importation of infectious diseases and the consequent public health and other implications." ],

Critics of fideism say that epistemologically, a hierarchy of methods can be used to derive the truth, and each method gives us varying confidence levels. These methods include mathematics and logic, science, personal experience, history, expert testimony, inference and Faith. Among these, the critic says, pure faith in something is the least successful in getting at the truth. Radical fideists like Kierkegaard do not cite logical reasons for defending their belief that God exists. Personal reasons are instead offered for their decision to believe. In this thesis I seek to demonstrate that the radical fideism advocated by Kierkegaard constitutes good justification for belief in the Christian God. I will begin with a discussion on fideism and some of its proponents, followed by a discussion on the place of faith (as a non-rational belief in God’s existence) in religion. I will then appeal to Kierkegaard’s philosophy in defending my view that religious belief in God is a matter of faith and personal commitment, feeling and passion, and this is an inner process not grounded in arguments. References will be drawn from Kierkegaard’s themes of faith, subjectivity and inwardness. I conclude by saying that even if no objective grounds exist to justify our belief, Kierkegaard standpoint remains right in two ways: Firstly, the fideist rejection of the attempt to justify his belief through offering reasons for it is precisely what makes his decision to believe deeply meaningful in his life. Secondly, those who ‘try to judge faith by objective, critical reflection will go on forever that way, and will never reach the point of having faith and of being religious’.

  "texts" : [ "Capturing complexities of student leadership: knowledge, power and practicalities", "Over the past decade student participation in school leadership has gained prominence in the field of education. However, the concept of ‘student leadership’ remains broad and elusive, allowing many school leaders to misuse it in ways that serve their own needs. Student leadership is defined here as student participation in activities which promote self-advocacy (Lansdown, 2000: 16). There are very few studies which actually examine the relationship between student leadership and school decision-making. This paper reports on a case study of student-led project at an independent high school in England. The students lead a consortium of teachers and administrators at the school to draw up policy recommendation on learning with ICT at the school, which are forwarded to the school’s senior management team. Using the case study as reference, this paper argues that student leadership although full of hopes and aspirations for the future of education, is at present fraught with complexities. These include issues of knowledge: when the roles of learner and teacher are reversed, power: based on who decided what is included in the agendas, and practicalities such as time and resources.Lansdown, G.

  "texts" : [ "eLearning courses about national tourism destinations: destination management organizations’ offers and travel agents’ perceptions and motivations", "A broad number of studies have been undertaken so far both by the  academic research and by industry communities on the use of the  internet for educational purposes. However, very limited research has  been done previously on the use of Information and Communication  Technologies (ICTs) as educational and training modes within the  hospitality and tourism field. Travel agent training, certification  processes and the use of ICTs to deliver training to the travel trade have  been largely excluded from the previous academic research. This study  aimed to address this research gap with the purpose to understand  eLearning offerings within the tourism field. It explored the use of  eLearning courses created by Destination Management Organizations  (DMOs) for the education and certification of their travel trade partners.  Additionally, it investigated the reactions and motivations of the users –  travel agents based in the United Kingdom, India and New Zealand – on  those training activities. In order to answer specific research questions,  this thesis adopted a mixed method approach including both qualitative  (benchmarking and case studies), and quantitative (online  questionnaires and phone interviews) research instruments. This  interdisciplinary research project contains elements of the following  research fields: tourism and eTourism, education and eLearning, Human  Resource Management, as well as motivational theories. This study  explored all existing eLearning offers provided by DMOs worldwide. 75  available eLearning courses about national tourism destinations were  analysed looking thoroughly at their structure. Additionally, semi- structured interviews were undertaken with the representatives of two  DMOs: Tourism New Zealand and Swiss National Tourism Office, in  order to provide an in-depth corporate view on the subject matter: Kiwi  Specialist Program and Switzerland Travel Academy. An online  exploratory questionnaire with the travel agents globally has been done  in order to evaluate participation in and awareness about eLearning  courses about tourism destinations and subsequent reactions of the  travel agents on them. Phone interviews with travel agents based in the  United Kingdom (#190), India (#272) and New Zealand (#165) were then  conducted in order to discover the rates of current usage. This study  also looked at the rates of awareness of eLearning courses in the three  studied countries, as well as investigated what motivates and  discourages travel agents to participate in online training activities. The  final online questionnaire (#249) tested a new theoretical model on the  motivational factors for attending eLearning courses about tourism  destinations. The model was based on the series of elements derived  from the previous steps within this study as well as incorporated the  elements from existing motivation theories. This study revealed benefits  of eLearning as a new form of training within the tourism industry.  eLearning courses are believed to be a convenient mode of training,  which gives a greater access to education for travel agents globally,  especially to those based in geographically isolated locations. eLearning  courses are financially viable from both the provider and the user  perspective as well as enhance the performance of travel agents within  their roles, and presumably the satisfaction of their current or potential  clients. Travel agents undertake eLearning activities, as they believe  them to be helpful in work-related tasks as well as are beneficial for  updating needed knowledge. Additionally, travel agents appreciate the  opportunity to study online, while being able to update their knowledge  on their own pace and in a flexible environment. The research revealed  that travel agents in the three studied countries are not attending  eLearning courses about tourism destinations due to a desire to feel  related to their managers or colleagues. The study showed that  participation in the eLearning courses depends on the country where  travel agents are based, the type of agency they work for and their  gender. While the age of the travel agents and their educational level did  not show any significant influences on the participation level. At the  same time, awareness about the existence of eLearning courses about  tourism destinations depends on the county where travel agents are  based, and doesn’t depend on their age, gender, type of agency they  work for or their educational level. This thesis provided the first empirical  results in the field for the use of ICTs for Human Resource Management  of the travel trade. It is the first extensive study on eLearning usages  within on-the-job training in the hospitality and tourism industry. This  study contributed to eTourism and eLearning literature, within a given  professional family, that of the travel agent. The research has analysed  and tested the factors influencing travel agents’ participation in and  awareness about eLearning courses about tourism destinations.  Furthermore, this research has proposed and tested a sound empirically  based theoretical framework for the evaluation of the motivational  drivers in the specific context, those of travel agents on undertaking  destinational eLearning courses. The results of the study also have  industry implications, particularly the first understanding of the eLearning  options through a benchmarking study of all existing national eLearning  courses about tourism destinations as well as through two case  studies, which presented the managerial perspective on the studied  issue. Furthermore, marketing, trade partnership and training managers  within national, regional and local tourism offices are presented with the  first research on travel agents’ evaluation of eLearning training  platforms, on the rates awareness and participation in the United  Kingdom, India and New Zealand and on their motivations on starting an  online training activity. This research can help representatives of the  DMOs to understand better the role of eLearning for travel agents, and,  therefore, develop more efficient and effective strategies and actions in  their trade and training partnerships globally." ],

  "title" : "Pain management for women in labour: an overview of systematic reviews.",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Pain management for women in labour: an overview of systematic reviews.", "BACKGROUND: The pain that women experience during labour is affected by multiple physiological and psychosocial factors and its intensity can vary greatly.  Most women in labour require pain relief. Pain management strategies include non-pharmacological interventions (that aim to help women cope with pain in labour) and pharmacological interventions (that aim to relieve the pain of labour). OBJECTIVES: To summarise the evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews on the efficacy and safety of non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions to manage pain in labour. We considered findings from non-Cochrane systematic reviews if there was no relevant Cochrane review. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 5), The Cochrane Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2 of 4), MEDLINE (1966 to 31 May 2011) and EMBASE (1974 to 31 May 2011) to identify all relevant systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials of pain management in labour. Each of the contributing Cochrane reviews (nine new, six updated) followed a generic protocol with 13 common primary efficacy and safety outcomes. Each Cochrane review included comparisons with placebo, standard care or with a different intervention according to a predefined hierarchy of interventions. Two review authors extracted data and assessed methodological quality, and data were checked by a third author. This overview is a narrative summary of the results obtained from individual reviews. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 15 Cochrane reviews (255 included trials) and three non-Cochrane reviews (55 included trials) for inclusion within this overview. For all interventions, with available data, results are presented as comparisons of: 1. Intervention versus placebo or standard care; 2. Different forms of the same intervention (e.g. one opioid versus another opioid); 3. One type of intervention versus a different type of intervention (e.g. TENS versus opioid). Not all reviews included results for all comparisons. Most reviews compared the intervention with placebo or standard care, but with the exception of opioids and epidural analgesia, there were few direct comparisons between different forms of the same intervention, and even fewer comparisons between different interventions. Based on these three comparisons, we have categorised interventions into: \" What works\" ,\"What may work\", and \"Insufficient evidence to make a judgement\".WHAT WORKSEvidence suggests that epidural, combined spinal epidural (CSE) and inhaled analgesia effectively manage pain in labour, but may give rise to adverse effects. Epidural, and inhaled analgesia effectively relieve pain when compared with placebo or a different type of intervention (epidural versus opioids). Combined-spinal epidurals relieve pain more quickly than traditional or low dose epidurals. Women receiving inhaled analgesia were more likely to experience vomiting, nausea and dizziness.When compared with placebo or opioids, women receiving epidural analgesia had more instrumental vaginal births and caesarean sections for fetal distress, although there was no difference in the rates of caesarean section overall. Women receiving epidural analgesia were more likely to experience hypotension, motor blockade, fever or urinary retention. Less urinary retention was observed in women receiving CSE than in women receiving traditional epidurals. More women receiving CSE than low-dose epidural experienced pruritus.  WHAT MAY WORKThere is some evidence to suggest that immersion in water, relaxation, acupuncture, massage and local anaesthetic nerve blocks or non-opioid drugs may improve management of labour pain, with few adverse effects.  Evidence was mainly limited to single trials. These interventions relieved pain and improved satisfaction with pain relief (immersion, relaxation, acupuncture, local anaesthetic nerve blocks, non-opioids) and childbirth experience (immersion, relaxation, non-opioids) when compared with placebo or standard care. Relaxation was associated with fewer assisted vaginal births and acupuncture was associated with fewer assisted vaginal births and caesarean sections.INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCEThere is insufficient evidence to make judgements on whether or not hypnosis, biofeedback, sterile water injection, aromatherapy, TENS, or parenteral opioids are more effective than placebo or other interventions for pain management in labour. In comparison with other opioids more women receiving pethidine experienced adverse effects including drowsiness and nausea.  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Most methods of non-pharmacological pain management are non-invasive and appear to be safe for mother and baby, however, their efficacy is unclear, due to limited high quality evidence. In many reviews, only one or two trials provided outcome data for analysis and the overall methodological quality of the trials was low. High quality trials are needed.There is more evidence to support the efficacy of pharmacological methods, but these have more adverse effects. Thus, epidural analgesia provides effective pain relief but at the cost of increased instrumental vaginal birth.It remains important to tailor methods used to each woman's wishes, needs and circumstances, such as anticipated duration of labour, the infant's condition, and any augmentation or induction of labour.A major challenge in compiling this overview, and the individual systematic reviews on which it is based, has been the variation in use of different process and outcome measures in different trials, particularly assessment of pain and its relief, and effects on the neonate after birth. This made it difficult to pool results from otherwise similar studies, and to derive conclusions from the totality of evidence. Other important outcomes have simply not been assessed in trials; thus, despite concerns for 30 years or more about the effects of maternal opioid administration during labour on subsequent neonatal behaviour and its influence on breastfeeding, only two out of 57 trials of opioids reported breastfeeding as an outcome. We therefore strongly recommend that the outcome measures, agreed through wide consultation for this project, are used in all future trials of methods of pain management." ],

  "texts" : [ "Business Regulation, Inward Foreign Direct Investment, and Economic Growth in the New European Union Member States", "Purpose â The purpose of this paper is to assess the extent to which institutional convergence has taken place in the new European Union (EU) member states. It does so by contrasting arguments that are inspired by transaction-cost economics within the mainstream international-business literature and contentions within the comparative-capitalisms perspective. A corollary of arguments within the\nformer is that those countries that have less transparent ways of doing business will post poorer economic growth records than those with more predictable and less costly regulations. By contrast, contentions within the comparative-capitalisms literature lead to expectations that a broader set of institutional factors will shape economic growth.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach â The article adopts a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis approach to examine the necessary and sufficient causal conditions for economic growth in the region.\n\nFindings â There is a great deal of institutional diversity within the new EU member states in Central and Eastern Europe. There are no clusters of countries around a specific variety of capitalism or an economic model that has above-average economic growth rates and that is characterized by\ninstitutions that lower the costs of market transacting. This, in turn, suggests that convergence pressures are not as great as the mainstream international-business literature has argued.\n\nResearch limitations/implications â Future research could complement this study by adopting a cross-country, comparative micro- or firm-level approach to examine the ways in which different institutional factors, both individually and collectively, shape the growth of businesses and consequently, economies.\n\nOriginality/value â Mainstream international business tends to focus on regulation and market-supporting institutions to explain growth in developing economies. This research has shown that a broader view of institutions needs to be adopted, as some countries have been able to post strong economic growth figures despite institutional environments that do not lower the costs of market-based contracting." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "The drop out experience of basic school children in rural Ghana: implications for universal basic education policy", "One of the key issues surrounding participation in basic schooling is the phenomenon of school dropout. Dropout is known not as a single event but a process that is not well understood. The rationale for this thesis argues that unless the dropout process is understood, there will be no meaningful intervention to curb it. This study therefore explores the dropout experience of basic school children in Ghana. In the context of this exploratory study, informed by the concerns of achieving education for all children by the year 2015, I sought to gain insight into the processes that lead children to drop out of school, how dropout occurs, the manifestation of dropout and the policy implications of dropout for free compulsory universal basic education in Ghana.\r\n\r\nThe research inquiry is guided by two main research questions: what are the experiences of dropout children? And how is school dropout manifested? Specifically, the research questions sought to explore children‘s understanding and interpretation of dropout, how dropout occurred; what conditions within and outside school do children regard as responsible for their dropping out, and what the implications of the findings are for universalising universal basic education in Ghana.\r\n\r\nIn exploring the experience of dropout children, I tracked 18 children who had initial access to basic education but stopped schooling at some point for their stories. I used multiple methods of data collection, viz. in-depth interviews, observations, photographs and school records.\r\n\r\nFrom the data gathered, the following are the main findings of the study:\r\nConcerning the dropout process, children experience dropout first as temporary—sporadic, event and cohort based on their economic survival needs and later permanently—unsettled and settled as a result of becoming significantly overage and the diminished value of schooling.\r\n\r\nConditions both within school – teacher factor, school practices and processes, and outside – poverty, opportunity cost of schooling, networks among children to encourage dropout by pushing and/or pulling children out of school.\r\n\r\nAs a process, pupils go through three phases – disadvantage, disaffection and disappearance to become school dropouts.\r\n\r\nIt is argued that, to prevent pupils from dropping out of school and to encourage children who already dropped out to return to school. Education policy would have to focus more on addressing the peculiar needs of children who show sights of entering the dropout process. Also, it is necessary to differentiate out of school children – dropouts from out of school children –never enrolled when designing and implementing interventions for universalising basic education." ],

Understanding the factors that influence their attainment is a crucial first step towards developing more effective provision. In the current study we present a multi-level, natural variation analysis which highlights important determinants at school and individual levels in two core academic subjects (English and Maths) using a nationally representative sample of over 15,000 students with SEND attending more than 400 schools across England. We found that at the school level, inclusivity, attainment, free school meal (FSM) eligibility, behaviour (in primary schools) and linguistic diversity (secondary schools), and at the student level, age, sex, FSM eligibility, SEND provision, SEND primary need, attendance, behaviour and positive relationships each contributed to the distribution of academic attainment.

Gender and Wealth (Dis)Accumulation in the Subprime Boom", "Subprime lending has become the penultimate case study for critics of the recent period of financialization, or neo-liberalism more broadly, because it exposes the most profligate tendencies of predatory lending and the pernicious social costs visited on society's most vulnerable groups. This article builds on the social stratification and wealth accumulation literature. We assess how mounting debt levels and crippling costs of servicing these debts compared to relatively flat income growth for female-headed households have resulted in wealth (dis)accumulation. We use the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) to analyze how single female-headed households, and in particular how African American single mothers were affected by the subprime boom in different, arguably more pernicious, ways. There is already considerable evidence showing that subprime lending was disproportionally sold to women, particularly minority women. Focusing on single mothers reveals important gender and racial dimensions of the lending techniques, but it also shows how marginalized families increasingly relied on housing wealth (equity) to adjust to shrinking purchasing power. Thus, contrary to the lofty expectations of the ownership society, the high mortgage debts of many low-income women suggest they own a lesser share of their homes – (dis)accumulation of wealth – than at any previous time." ],

In each sector, the growth rates of aggregate insurance premiums are viewed as portfolio returns which we attribute to a number of factors such as realized and expected losses and expenses, their uncertainty and market power, using the Sharpe (Determining the Fund’s Effective Asset Mix. Investment Management Review, November–December, pp. 59–69, 1988; J. Portfolio Manag. 18:7–19, 1992) Style Analysis. Our estimation method differs from the standard least squares practice which does not provide confidence intervals for style betas and adopts a Bayesian approach, resulting in a robust estimate of the entire empirical distribution of each beta coefficients for the full sample. We also perform a rolling analysis of robust estimation for a window of seven overlapping samples. Our empirical findings show that there are some main differences across industries as far as the weights attributed to the underlying factors. Rolling regressions assist us to identify the variability of these weights over time, but also across industries." ],

Previous research is contradictory and has employed non-validated scar severity measures whilst neglecting patient-rated severity. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of objective and patient-rated scar severity, scar type and location on psychosocial distress. Skin scars were quantitatively assessed on two independent occasions using the 'Manchester Scar Scale' (MSS) - a validated measure. Scars were scored twice independently. Patients also rated their scars (from 'very good' [zero] to 'poor' [four]) and good completed the Derriford Appearance Scale (DAS24) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Eighty-two patients, with an average+/-SD (range) age of 34+/-15 (16-65) years were recruited. Mean psychosocial questionnaire scores were: DAS24 45.5+/-17.8 (15-91); DLQI 7.5+/-6.7 (0-26). Participants had 1.9+/-1.5 (1-8) scars with an MSS score of 31.3+/-24.0 (6.6-162.0) and subjective score of 2.6+/-1.2 (0-4). Correlation between psychosocial distress and objective severity was not significant (DAS24 0.14 p=0.11; DLQI 0.16 p=0.06). Correlation between psychosocial distress and subjective severity was significant (DAS24 0.48 p<0.0001; DLQI 0.46 p<0.0001). Patients with non-visible scars experienced greater psychosocial distress than patients with visible scars (DAS24 9.7 p=0.046; DLQI 4.2 p=0.014). Scar type was unrelated to psychosocial distress. Patient-rated scar severity and scar visibility are correlated with psychosocial distress rather than clinician's objective severity rating or scar type. Although counter-intuitive, results are consistent with research into other disfiguring conditions and patient self-assessment should therefore form an integral part of clinical assessment." ],

  "texts" : [ "The Local Structure of Globalisation - The Network Dynamics of Foreign Direct Investments in the International Electricity Industry", "We study the evolution of the network of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the international electricity industry during the period 1994–2003. We assume that the ties in the network of investment relations between countries are created and deleted in continu- ous time, according to a conditional Gibbs distribution. This assumption allows us to take simultaneously into account the aggregate predictions of the well-established gravity model of international trade as well as local dependencies between network ties connecting the countries in our sample. According to the modified version of the gravity model that we specify, the probability of observing an investment tie between two countries depends on the mass of the economies involved, their physical distance, and the tendency of the network to self-organize into local configurations of network ties. While the limiting distribution of the data generating process is an exponential random graph model, we do not assume the system to be in equilibrium. We find evidence of the effects of the standard gravity model of international trade on evolution of the global FDI network. However, we also provide ev- idence of significant dyadic and extra-dyadic dependencies between investment ties that are typically ignored in available research. We show that local dependencies between national electricity industries are sufficient for explaining global properties of the network of foreign direct investments. We also show, however, that network dependencies vary significantly over time giving rise to a time-heterogeneous localized process of network evolution." ],

We investigated independent and interactive effects of PPARγ2 gene PPARG Pro12Ala (rs1801282) andPPARαgene PPARA Leu162Val (rs1800206) genotypes with dietary intake of fatty acids on concentrations of plasma lipids in subjects of whom 47.5% had metabolic syndrome. METHODS: The RISCK study is a parallel design, randomised controlled trial. Plasma lipids were quantified at baseline after a 4-week high saturated fatty acids diet and after three parallel 24-week interventions with reference (high saturated fatty acids), high monounsaturated fatty acids and low-fat diets. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped in 466 subjects. RESULTS: At baseline, the PPARG Ala12allele was associated with increased plasma total cholesterol (n = 378; p = 0.04), LDL cholesterol (p = 0.05) and apoB (p =0.05) after adjustment for age, gender and ethnicity. At baseline, PPARA Leu162Val × PPARG Pro12Ala genotype interaction did not significantly influence plasma lipid concentrations. After dietary intervention, gene-gene interaction significantly influenced LDL cholesterol (p =0.0002) and small dense LDL as a proportion of LDL (p = 0.005) after adjustments. CONCLUSIONS: Interaction between PPARG Pro12Ala and PPARA Leu162Val genotypes may influence plasma LDL cholesterol concentration and the proportion as small dense LDL after a high monounsaturated fatty acids diet." ],

When tackling such problems with ensembles, the concept of \\emph{diversity} appears to be of significance. In this paper, we discuss how we expect diversity to impact the rate of adaptation in non-stationary ensemble learning. We then analyse the relation between voting margins and a popular measure of diversity, KW variance, and use the similarities between them to draw some useful conclusions regarding ensemble adaptivity." ],

This paper reports on experiences of applying RM-ODP technology and mobile communications in supporting field workers in the electricity industry. The results of the study show that the framework provided by RM-ODP offers a strong basis for the development of mobile applications. Particular benefits are gained from the object-oriented modelling approach, the model of selective distribution transparency and the concept of QoS-managed bindings in RM-ODP. However, our experiences indicate that care must be taken in the development of RM-ODP compliant platforms particularly with respect to the communications infrastructure." ],

  "texts" : [ "A Cultural Ecological Approach for Meal Security A Case Study of the Dynamics of the Food Habits in El Obeid, Sudan", "Worldwide more food than ever is produced these days. It would be enough to feed everybody by far. However, only a limited group of the global population enjoys an adequate food supply. About 854 million people are undernourished worldwide. The global situation shows that hunger cannot be fought by just producing enough food. The socio-cultural complex of nutrition and food habits cannot be reduced to the production and marketing of crops. To fight the problem of lacking food security, ecological and socio-cultural conditions have to be taken into account.This research focuses on the questions of ‘what is food’ and ‘why is certain food eaten in a specific way’ as prerequisites to understand the problem of malnutrition and food shortage as well as to fight food insecurity. Humans could eat anything that is digestible and not poisonous. However, they do not do so. Even though all human beings share the need to provide enough energy and nutrients for their metabolic functions, they do not think of the energy or nutrient content of food when they eat. Food is eaten according to certain social and cultural norms and meanings. Food usually is not consumed as grown or found in nature. Through technologies, skills, and knowledge the raw matter is transformed into a meal and eaten in a way according to given socio-cultural norms. People eat a culturally bound meal which satisfies not only their dietary needs but culinary desires. Food habits are a result of the interaction between different natural and cultural factors and the ability of the individual to interact with both these spheres. Therefore, this research analyses the complexity of food habits, their dynamics, and how the food culture of a society interacts with the natural and socio-cultural environment. According to this, a cultural ecological concept of food culture - the cycle of meal - is introduced. It focuses on the interdependence and interactions of food habits within the natural and cultural environment. Moreover, the concept emphasises the importance of meal preparation as essential procedure of transforming natural raw matters into culturally bound products and as fundamental element to reach not only food but meal security. This study bases on research conducted in the town El Obeid in Central Sudan, which is located in the remote and famine-prone environment of North Kordofan. The case study shows that food shortage can only be understood and fought if food culture is considered as a central element of meal security. Therefore, the research is based on the examination of food habits, their dynamics, and interactions within the socio-cultural context." ],

  "texts" : [ "Health problems of travellers: an examination of GeoSentinel and expedition data", "Childhood memories recall the endeavours of famous travellers in time whose moments of great occasion were often wrecked by diseases encountered on deployment.  Take Genghis Khan, whose most indirect, though by no means benign, gift to the 13th century was the plague. Originating in the jungles of southern China and Burma, bubonic plague travelled with Mongol armies and then from caravan to caravan till it reached the Crimea in 1347. From there it would take a third of all Europeans. \r\n\r\nTake this example as one of the human spread of disease and extend it to global travel in the 21st century. It is so much easier now to spread disease as travel is quicker, easier and many more people are partaking in it. Short incubation periods indicate the potential to promulgate disease processes is so much greater, and indeed with more disastrous effect. In addition, as there are so many different communicable diseases, there is the very real risk of mis-diagnosis with resultant dire consequences.\r\n\r\nTo focus energies on the prevention of traveller’s diseases would be akin to guiding good health in a way that supports not just the traveller, but the region of travel as well. To spotlight certain dis-ease, and diseases, in order to give clear examples of the work that goes into preventing traveller-health unwellness became, for the author, a logical nidus for energy. The projected outcome of such a fixation would be a set of parameters within which safe travel is possible. \r\n\r\nWhilst not wanting to stifle travel with such apparent ‘rules’, popular thinking in the speciality of travel medicine has it that ‘guidelines for travel’ contribute to safe and secure travel, and also to diseases’ awareness with their resultant measures of prevention. \r\n\r\nThe stimulus to investigate illnesses that may affect travellers extended into those that may affect groups of people on collective journeys, and even those who were mounting expeditions to remote regions of the globe for venture or adventure. As it was not possible to be all encompassing with respect to the spectrum of travellers’ health diseases, it was important to acquire primary sentinels upon which to bass understanding of the disease processes and from them to make practical inference from the results. \r\n\r\nThis thesis thus centres on the general epidemiology of travel diseases and then seeks to investigate some focal aspects such as rabies immunisation, groups and expedition medicine, and incidental case studies to give clear example of the scope of this rather exciting field of medicine. From consideration of these examples, the development of policies on travel health management is a logical extension. Reviewing available data on outstanding issues such as: health of sportspeople at a major sporting event, vaccine preventable diseases and setting up a travel health clinic, is both exhilarating and intellectually challenging. \r\n\r\nEnveloping all these aspects of travel medicine is personally energising and gives thought to clinical practice. It also gives energetic notice to want to pursue the field further in the future.  \r\n\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nMethods of data collection and analysis were dependant upon the each of the three focus groups analysed. Firstly, those returning from their travels and who presented to travel health clinics in Auckland or Hamilton were assessed for illnesses acquired abroad.  Secondly, those in the group targetted for either rabies pre-travel immunisation or port-travel rabies exposure were scoped in detail. Thirdly, the group that undertook remote travel by way of expeditions or premium travel tours were assessed for illnesses as they may have been obtained; viz, in the field. Some of these patients may have had a pre-travel consultation to anticipate overseas health issues from travel health professionals before they departed for overseas. \r\n\r\nGlobal surveillance of emerging infections by way of a sentinel network enabled the collection of data for analysis of each of groups one and two, above. Being part of a expedition group, as the medical provider, guided the collection of information in group three. Group one was studied from 1997 until 2001. Group two from 1998 through until 2006. Finally, group three was studying from 2001 until 2004. \r\n\r\nRecorded data for all patients presenting for travel-related illnesses, seen at the two sites in New Zealand, were extracted for analysis. Variables analysed included age, sex, pre-travel encounter, reason for travelling, patient classification (whether a New Zealander having returned from abroad, or a foreigner being assessed in New Zealand clinic ) and a post-travel diagnosis. In addition, patients with a diagnosis of animal-related injury (mammal bites or scratches) were included for analysis as a separate disease focus within the greater spectrum of general global ill health following travel abroad.  \r\n\r\nPatients seeking care for rabies post-exposure prophylaxis were also included. Data was collected on the following: gender, country and world region where exposure occurred, age of subject exposed, animal related to the exposure, site of exposure on the body, the World Health Organization category of exposure to potential rabies, pre-exposure prophylaxis status, post-exposure immunoglobulin given, post-exposure vaccine given, type of post-exposure vaccination regime and whether it was an approved vaccine, and finally, the presence or absence of travel health insurance. \r\n\r\nThe third group for micro-focused study in this thesis involved those going to remote global regions. From the commencement of the Sir Peter Blake Expedition to Brazil and Venezuela in 2001, the author (as expedition physician) recorded all illnesses and injuries amongst the crew and also amongst the indigenous people encountered, whilst undertaking the expedition. Information recorded included age, sex, subjective and objective nature of the presenting illness, the assessment of the condition based on presenting information and the treatment employed. The outcome of each presentation was tracked and follow-up was continuously maintained wherever possible. \r\n\r\nThere continues to be a growing popularity of travellers wishing to go on premium tours or expeditions, and little is known or written on the illnesses and injuries that may occur whilst travelling. Studies on the injuries and illnesses of various group-travels to countries such as may be encountered on the Silk Route in Middle Asia, the Arctic Circle, and the Mongolian Gobi are presented. All seek to investigate the prevalence of health problems suffered by travellers on a premium, expedition or remote medicine journey.  \r\n\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\nInformation on travel-related illnesses, when reported through a global reporting system, can be useful for the travel health adviser in identifying issues of current concern. Diarrhoeal disease was assessed as being the most common diagnosis of illness in the returning traveller, followed by animal bites, skin diseases and schistosomiasis. Other tropical diseases however, such as malaria, were uncommon diseases amongst returning travellers. GeoSentinel, a global surveillance network, makes a significant contribution to the assessing emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases through a network of individual sites in various countries including New Zealand. Such information can be used to help provide preventive advice for travellers as well as help in assessing illness in post-travel patients. \r\n\r\nAnimal-associated injuries are not uncommon among returned travellers presenting to GeoSentinel sites. The highest proportion of potential rabies-exposure injuries was recorded in travellers to Asia, mostly in regions which are endemic for rabies, and this had led to a requirement for Post Exposure Prophylaxis. There is an inadequacy in current practice for rabies-exposed injured travellers, who need to be adequately counselled about animal-associated injuries and rabies risk when visiting rabies-infected countries. Concern must be expressed for the small number of travellers who were immunised prior to their travel, of whom a quarter were bitten overseas and received initial post-exposure treatment consistent with the World Health Organization guidelines. The risk of rabies in children younger than 8 years, who are at particular risk for animal bites requires particular attention; especially as this group represented nearly twenty percent of cases in this study. It is thus important that travellers from New Zealand are made aware of the risks of developing rabies secondary to animal exposure in countries they travel to, and all travellers need to obtain adequate pre-travel health advice, on the prevention of a disease that is virtually 100% fatal, from a qualified travellers’ health source.\r\n\r\nIntradermal rabies immunisation appears very effective when given according to the standard WHO protocol in a cohort of intending New Zealand travellers. Thus, intradermal rabies immunisation is highly recommended for those travelling to endemic areas for the risk of rabies, particularly where follow-up serology can be done before travel and where there are staff who are experienced in this form of immunisation administration. \r\n\r\nExploration and adventure travel are increasingly attractive to people of widely differing ages, experience, physical health and interests. Whilst there are significant health challenges to practitioners of expedition medicine, the aims remain to anticipate preventable medical problems, to maintain health throughout the expedition, to optimise achievement and enjoyment, whilst not stifling enthusiasm or ambition. The modern practice of expedition medicine is to minimise the risk of trauma and diseases by proper pre-travel planning involving risk assessment, preventive measures such as vaccinations, prophylactic drugs and medical equipment, knowledge of first aid, emergency and primary healthcare skills, communication skills, and an attitude of caring for both the anticipated team and the anticipated cultures of the expedition.  This planning should cover all contingencies; from mild illnesses and disease to group health insurances, through to unforeseen events such as evacuating a seriously ill, injured or dead person. \r\n\r\nThe inclusion of an expedition physician on an expedition increased the independence of the travelling group on their journeying, yet decreased the reliance on local health services, a source which is often scarce or absent on more remote location expeditions. \r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nInformation changes quickly, and often dramatically. Anyone providing travel health information needs to be aware of the requirements of international travellers, for information on travel-related illnesses, when reported through a global reporting system, can be useful for the travel health adviser in identifying geographical diseases of global concern. Whilst illnesses and injuries encountered by international travellers tended to centre on ‘syndromic presentation’ of diarrhoeal, respiratory or dermatological illness, the travel health professional needs to be knowledgeable on their presentation. In being so, the clinician is acting as a clinical sentinel for transmissible disease processes. Being part of such a sentinel group makes a global contribution to the surveillance of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases through a network of individual sites in various countries including New Zealand. This information can be used to help provide preventive advice for travellers as well as help in assessing illness in post-travel patients. Such is the case with the disease of rabies. There is increased awareness in New Zealand to make travellers aware of the risks of developing rabies secondary to animal exposure in countries they travel to. \r\n\r\nAs there is no clear distinction between those who travel either as expedition team members or others who travel to ‘wilderness’ areas, there is considerable overlap between adventure travel and leisure travel.  Exploration and adventure travel are increasingly attractive to people of widely differing ages, experience, physical health and interests and this tends to create new challenges to practitioners of expedition medicine although the aims remain to anticipate preventable medical problems, to maintain health throughout the expedition, to optimise achievement and enjoyment, but above all not to stifle enthusiasm or ambition of the journey!" ],

  "title" : "Guided tourism : the role of guidebooks in German tourist behaviour in Sweden",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Guided tourism : the role of guidebooks in German tourist behaviour in Sweden", "Tourism is a spatial phenomenon. Tourist behaviour on-site is not only dependent on the destination itself, but also on the situation in other places, tourists’ spatial mobility and access to information. On the basis of this argument, the whole tourism system is taken into account in this thesis. The aim is to analyse the interplay between mobility, tourist behaviour and guidebooks. The focus lies on German tourists in Sweden. Due to the importance of guidebooks to this visitor group, the thesis concentrates particularly on guidebooks as source of information. In the first article, power relations that steer the selection of Swedish tourist sites in German guidebooks are analysed. The results show that the selection of tourist sites is dependent on personal, editorial, geographical, economic and tourism-sociological factors. The production of information is dependent on a complex web of power relations, the core of which is constituted by authors, publishers and readers. In the second article, the content in German guidebooks on Sweden is analysed. Besides Stockholm and Northern Lapland, the regions presented most frequently are usually located in the south of the country. It is found that guidebooks influence German tourists’ choices of tourist sites in Sweden, and that this influence increases with the distance from Germany. The study also shows that guidebooks contribute to constructing tourism space and providing places with meaning. In the third article, it is shown that information and time availability influence tourist mobility. The existence of an individual travel rhythm is confirmed, which is defined as a travel pattern that is independent of the tourist sites that are visited. It includes, among other things, long travel distances the first and last days of the holiday, a short first stay-over, the longest stay in the region with the greatest distance from home, and a relation between the length of stay at one place and the distance covered when departing. In the last article, tourist behaviour is analysed. The results dispel the predominant impression in current tourism discourse that states that tourists are continually active during their holidays. It is found that the major difference between home and tourist behaviour is not constituted by the activities themselves, but by a difference in place, followed by a slower pace in which activities are performed and a limited time period. Spatial mobility, the characteristics of place and access to information all influence tourist behaviour on-site. In conclusion, it is found that tourist information, mobility and behaviour on the spot are closely connected. Tourists consume the tourism space created in guidebooks, and recreate this space when travelling, as they choose individually how to respond to the information provided. Actors, places and tourist structures all exist in relation to each other. For the resulting behaviour in place, this means that it is not only the supply at the destination that is important, but also the situation in tourists’ home regions and along their travel routes." ],

  "texts" : [ "Spectre of the Subprime Borrower—beyond a credit score perspective", "The subprime borrower has achieved a celebrity status as of late. In this evolving tale of financial woe, the subprime borrower has delivered a fatal blow to the global financial markets. Two distinct personalities have emerged from this unfolding saga: the incredulous and financially illiterate subprime borrower pit against the greedy and often predatory lender. In retrospect lending to this group of low-income/ high-risk individuals is now considered indicative of the foot-loose tendencies of financial actors and complacent nature of the financial regulatory environment. Yet, the availability of credit to subprime borrowers was, not to long ago, heralded as a major achievement of newly liberalized financial markets. Risk calculation and balance sheet management techniques showed that markets, without the interference government, were able to democratize access to finance. Up until the summer of 2007, little attention had been paid to the subprime borrower and their experience of the ‘roaring 90s’ and past seven years of financialized expansion. The term ‘subprime’ refers to credit status that encompasses a wide range of socio-economic grouping. Using existing qualitative accounts of the causes of rising consumer debt, coupled with the limited quantitative data available on subprime borrowers, this article moves away from the linear (and coherent) account of credit as a transaction between borrower and lender. The attempt isto engage with the lived experience of these groups of the past seven years to understand the role that consumer credit plays in their everyday life. By drawing together the outcomes presented in existing literatures on labour market reform, rising education costs and declining state subsidies these trends are contextualized as factors contributing to the broader consumer credit boom. In particular, how these groups have lived on the frontier of receding state subsidies and advancing credit products." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Antibiotic treatment for Burkholderia cepacia complex in people with cystic fibrosis experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation", "BACKGROUND: Chronic pulmonary infection is one of the hallmarks of lung disease in cystic fibrosis. Infections dominated by organisms of the Burkholderia cepacia complex, a group of at least 17 closely-related species of gram-negative bacteria, are particularly difficult to treat. These infections may be associated with a fulminant necrotising pneumonia, and are greatly feared by patients. Burkholderia cepacia bacteria are innately resistant to many common antibiotics and able to acquire resistance against many more. Since strict patient segregation was introduced to cystic fibrosis medical care, the incidence of the more virulent epidemic strains has fallen, and new infections are more likely to be with environmentally-acquired strains which seem to exhibit less virulence. Nonetheless, exacerbations of respiratory symptoms require effective therapy directed against the dominant bacterial species. Although evidence-based guidelines exist for the treatment of respiratory exacerbations involving Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common chronic infection in cystic fibrosis, these cannot be directly extended to Burkholderia cepacia complex infections. The aim of this review is to assess the available trial evidence for choice and application of treatments for Burkholderia cepacia complex infections. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of different antibiotic regimens in people with cystic fibrosis experiencing an exacerbation, who are chronically infected with organisms of the Burkholderia cepacia complex. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews.Date of latest search: 29 November 2011. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of treatments for exacerbations of pulmonary symptoms in cystic fibrosis patients chronically infected with organisms of the Burkholderia cepacia complex. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: No relevant trials were identified. MAIN RESULTS: No trials were included in this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Burkholderia cepacia complex infections present a significant challenge for cystic fibrosis clinicians and patients alike. The incidence is likely to increase as the cystic fibrosis population ages and the problem of how to manage and treat these infections becomes more important. There is a lack of trial evidence to guide decision making and no conclusions can be drawn from this review about the optimal antibiotic regimens for cystic fibrosis patients with chronic Burkholderia cepacia complex infections. Clinicians must continue to assess each patient individually, taking into account in vitro antibiotic susceptibility data, previous clinical responses and their own experience. There is a clear need for multi-centre randomised clinical trials to assess the effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens in cystic fibrosis patients infected with organisms of the Burkholderia cepacia complex." ],

  "texts" : [ "Near field communications: privacy, regulation & business models", "The implications of extended and intensive use of near field communications (NFC) are far reaching\r\nfor new business applications, for the delivery of public services such as transport, and for public\r\npolicy. This technology is transformative for a large number of applications and has stimulated\r\ninnumerable innovative forms, but so far there has been insufficient insight expressed in discussions\r\nabout its impact and risks. The purpose of these studies is to assess the character and use of contactless\r\npayment technologies and the future of NFC with a focus on what are by far its most extensive\r\napplications in public transport. We use our evidence to structure a new understanding of the economic,\r\nbusiness, legal and policy aspects of its anticipated widespread growth, especially as embodied in\r\nmobile devices.\r\nNFC wireless technology allows information to be exchanged, via radio signals, between two NFCenabled\r\ndevices over short distances. To date the most extensively used form of payment is contactless\r\ntravel card tickets. However, NFC is increasingly being used on mobile phones with an 'electronic\r\nwallet' function, which allows people to make payments and manage other forms of exchange.\r\nThe lack of insightful discussion of these far reaching effects brings significant risks. They include a\r\nnew level of intensity of the pressure to undermine (or alter) principles and practices of safeguarding\r\nprivacy. They raise concerns about the special status of children and other unwary users whose privacy\r\nmight be compromised. They also intensify the concern we might have about breaches of data security\r\nor data loss, given the ability of NFC data to include location as well as payment information.\r\nWe review the regulations and policies governing NFC in Europe and Asia and the incentives and\r\nbarriers to the commercial development of NFC. The use of contactless payment technologies in public\r\ntransport ticketing schemes – such as the Oyster card in London and the Octopus card in Hong Kong\r\nprovide case studies for the research. Our investigation is based on legal and business analyses, case\r\nstudies and considerations of the changing functionalities of NFC. We have also interviewed numerous\r\nexperts in regulation, policy and business about trends in investment and policy.An overriding concern is that NFC will fail to achieve its potential. Until problems such as those associated with privacy and regulations are\r\novercome there will be insufficient progress on extending\r\nthe business models in ways stakeholders such as public authorities, consumers and investors expect.\r\nGiven the large scale of activities, any such delay would be extremely costly both in terms of\r\ninvestments and in terms of the expectations of this element of the ubiquitous digital infrastructure.\r\nThis report has eight sections. The first section covers the introduction to the research. Section two is a\r\nsummary of the aspects to be taken into account for NFC and its application for public transport.\r\nSection 3 describes the theoretical foundations of the analysis. Section 4 focuses on the contentious\r\nissues emerging from NFC, privacy and business models. Section 5 discusses the implications of\r\nextending the NFC public transport experiences to other business cases. Section 6 presents our view on\r\nthe future of NFC and its competitive environment. Section 7 addresses the key relationships that will\r\ndetermine NFC’s future, and section 8 presents our conclusions and our views on policy implications.\r\nWe also present our case about the implications for business models development.

  "texts" : [ "Stable isotope monitoring of benthic–planktonic coupling using salt marsh fish", "Salt marshes are important coastal ecosystems whose trophic function can be monitored with stable isotopes of abundant fish biosentinel species such as the mummichog Fundulus heteroclitus and the Atlantic silverside Menidia menidia. We compared movement patterns and feeding biology of these species in the summers of 1999 and 2000 in the Rowley River salt marsh estuary north of Boston, Massachusetts, USA. A 15N tracer addition experiment showed that fish of both species were more resident than transient, with mummichogs resident at scales of 1 km or less. Natural abundance stable isotope C, N, and S distributions showed that mummichogs feed more strongly in the benthic food web while silversides feed more in the planktonic food web, with % benthic feeding respectively averaging 58 ± 5 and 32 ± 3% (mean ± 95% confidence limit, CL). For both species, isotope results indicated considerable individual specialization in foraging behavior, likely related to use of channel habitat versus use of the marsh. Power analysis showed that measuring 3 composite samples each comprising 10 to 15 individual fish should provide relatively low errors of 0.5‰ (95% CL) or less around stable isotope averages. Use of such composite samples in monitoring programs will allow detection of significant temporal and spatial changes in benthic-planktonic coupling for salt marsh ecosystems, as recorded in average fish diets. Analyzing some individual fish also is recommended to obtain more detailed information on fish food sources, feeding specializations, and end-member isotope values used in estimating importance of benthic and planktonic food sources.Author Posting. © Inter-Research, 2008.

  "texts" : [ "Can nurses help identify patients with depression following stroke? A pilot study using two methods of detection.", "AIM: This paper reports a study to determine the accuracy of the Geriatric Mental State examination and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, when administered by a nurse, in detecting depression in patients who have recently had a stroke. BACKGROUND: After a stroke, survivors spend considerable amounts of time in the direct care of nurses. Many show signs of depression, and this has been associated with an adverse effect on recovery and rehabilitation. Identifying those with depression when they have communication and cognitive difficulties is especially difficult. Treatments are available to assist in the management of depression, and early detection and intervention may assist in this process. METHOD: A cross-sectional pilot study was conducted, comparing (a) clinical diagnosis of depression by a psychiatrist with (b) two clinical interviews, using the Geriatric Mental State examination and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, conducted by a nurse. The data were collected in 2002. FINDINGS: Twenty-eight patients, who were still in hospital in the second week poststroke, were included. The median age was 72 (interquartile range: 61-78). There were 14 males. The psychiatrist rated seven (25%) patients as depressed. The Geriatric Mental State examination had a sensitivity of 71%, a specificity of 67%, a positive predictive value of 42%, a negative predictive value of 88% in detecting depression and an overall efficiency of 68%. The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale had a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 65%, a positive predictive value of 54%, a negative predictive value of 100% and an overall efficiency of 75%. CONCLUSION: In this study, the Geriatric Mental State examination and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale were at least as efficient at detecting the depression in patients who have had a stroke. However, as the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale is quicker to administer, it may prove more useful to nurses clinically." ],

  "texts" : [ "Assessment of circulating biomarkers for potential pharmacodynamic utility in patients with lymphoma.", "PURPOSE: Treatment efficacy and toxicity are difficult to predict in lymphoma patients. In this study, the utility of circulating biomarkers in predicting and/or monitoring treatment efficacy/toxicity were investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Circulating biomarkers of cell death (nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) and cytokeratin 18 (CK18)), and circulating FLT3 ligand, a potential biomarker of myelosuppression, were assessed before and serially after standard chemotherapy in 49 patients with Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Cytokeratin 18 is not expressed in lymphoma cells so is a potential biomarker of epithelial toxicity in this setting. Tumour response was assessed before and after completion of chemotherapy by 2D and 3D computed tomography radiological response. RESULTS: Baseline nDNA level was significantly higher in all lymphoma subtypes compared with 61 healthy controls and was prognostic for progression-free survival in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Decreases in nDNA levels were observed in the first week after chemotherapy; in FL, early falls in nDNA predicted for long remission following therapy. In DLBCL, elevations in nDNA occurred in cases with progressive disease. Circulating CK18 increased within 48 h of chemotherapy and was significantly higher in patients experiencing epithelial toxicity graded >3 by Common Terminology for Classification of Adverse Events criteria. FLT3 ligand was elevated within 3-8 days of chemotherapy initiation and predicted those patients who subsequently developed neutropenic sepsis. CONCLUSION: These data suggest circulating biomarkers contribute useful information regarding tumour response and toxicity in patients receiving standard chemotherapy and have potential utility in the development of individualised treatment approaches in lymphoma. These biomarkers are now being tested within multicentre phase III trials to progress their qualification." ],

  "texts" : [ "Commercializing Biomedical Research Through Securitization Techniques", "Biomedical innovation has become riskier, more expensive and more difficult to finance with traditional sources such as private and public equity. Here we propose a financial structure in which a large number of biomedical programs at various stages of development are funded by a single entity to substantially reduce the portfolio's risk. The portfolio entity can finance its activities by issuing debt, a critical advantage because a much larger pool of capital is available for investment in debt versus equity. By employing financial engineering techniques such as securitization, it can raise even greater amounts of more-patient capital. In a simulation using historical data for new molecular entities in oncology from 1990 to 2011, we find that megafunds of $5–15 billion may yield average investment returns of 8.9–11.4% for equity holders and 5–8% for 'research-backed obligation' holders, which are lower than typical venture-capital hurdle rates but attractive to pension funds, insurance companies and other large institutional investors." ],

We aimed to evaluate the influence of new technologies and the re-organisation of paediatric neurosurgical services on survival outcomes.Study design: The patient list and tumour type was obtained from the North West Tumour Registry between January 1954 and December 2008. The patient’s case notes were retrospectively analysed. Subgroup univariate and multivariate analysis was performed for time period, extent of resection, location and age. Survival between subgroups was tested for significance using the log-rank test. Demographics: 129 patients were obtained from the registry with a histological diagnosis of ependymoma. The age ranged from 3.5 months to 182.5 months (15 years) with a mean age at presentation of 5.5years. The male to female ratio was 0.9:1.Results:Patients were stratified into five 11-year time periods from 1954 – 2008 according to their date of diagnosis. 5-year overall survival improved significantly from 20% to 71% for children diagnosed between 1954-1964 and 1998-2008 respectively. 5-year progression free survival also improved significantly, this was most pronounced for the latter time periods. This trend was also mirrored by the gross total resection rate which for the latter time periods increased substantially from 20% to 57%.Conclusion:We advocate that the introduction of new surgical technologies and amalgamation on paediatric neurosurgical services in North West England has led to improvements in ependymoma gross total resection rates and PFS." ],

Such studies tell us that secularisation happens because each cohort is less religious than the one before, and that socialisation in childhood and habits formed in young adulthood are overwhelmingly responsible for religious decline. In this article we use data from the International Social Survey Programme to consider the extent and magnitude of religious decline at the level of families, whether parental influence is greater in more religious countries, and which individual variables influence the intergenerational transmission of religious practice and whether these vary between different countries. We find that secularisation happens largely because many people are a little less religious than their parents, and relatively few are more religious. We also find that the patterns of transmission are remarkably stable: parents are no more influential in religious countries than in nonreligious countries, and there is no indication that they have lost influence over time." ],

We argue that these phrases occur frequently because they describe actions that are important story-telling elements for filmed narrative. We discuss how this knowledge helps the development of systems to structure semantic video content.</p>" ],

Limited evidence exists for the effects of carbonation and bolus temperature on swallowing behavior. Here, we investigated the effects of carbonation and temperature on swallowing behavior using a novel automated and complex swallowing reaction time task via pressure signal recordings in the hypopharynx. Healthy participants (n = 39, 27.7±5 years old) were randomized in two different experiments and asked to perform 10 normal-paced swallows, 10 fast-paced swallows, and 10 challenged swallows within a predetermined time-window of carbonated versus still water (experiment 1) and of cold (4 °C) versus hot (45 °C) versus room temperature (21 °C) water (experiment 2). Quantitative measurements of latencies and percentage of successful challenged swallows were collected and analyzed nonparametrically. An increase in successfully performed challenged swallowing task was observed with carbonated water versus still water (P = 0.021), whereas only cold water shortened the latencies of normally paced swallows compared with room (P = 0.001) and hot (P = 0.004) temperatures. Therefore, it appears that chemothermal stimulation with carbonation and cold are most effective at modulating water swallowing, which in part is likely to be driven by central swallowing afferent activity." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "On Making Agricultural Markets work for the Poor: New Evidence from Ethiopia", "This thesis contributes to the literature on making agricultural markets work for the poor, with specific reference to Ethiopia. It contains three substantive chapters, which may be read independently. The chapters use primary surveys with traders conducted in 2002 (chapters 2 and 3) and 2007 (all the chapters).Chapter 1 investigates Ethiopian traders’ decision on whether and how much to use brokers. Results shine light on how the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange (ECX), which recently formalized the brokerage functions, could be most beneficial for the functioning of agricultural markets. We show that the ECX could consider introducing new food crops in the trading system, offering warehouse receipt financing to its clients, and spreading the network of its warehouses throughout the country.Chapter 2 inquires whether the focus on technological and institutional upgrading is sufficient to make Ethiopian agricultural markets more efficient and if the existence of many small intermediaries causes market inefficiency. Findings suggest that, when transporters are used, transport costs could be reduced by avoiding trans-shipment, and reducing the number of times the transporter has to stop to allow for cargo loading and off-loading. No evidence is found for increasing returns to transaction size.Chapter 3 conceptualizes the notion of market integration as ‘tradability’ and analyses what determines the likelihood of market diversification among Ethiopian traders. The variables that are found to significantly impact on this probability are location (which is correlated with access to asphalt roads), availability of market information, traders’ educational level, access to commercial finance and storage capacity. Results indicate that market fundamentals affected the likelihood of market diversification more in 2007, when prices were rapidly surging, than in 2001 when prices were decreasing.The findings of this thesis support the ‘getting markets right’ school, in that incentives, infrastructure and institutions are essential for market development, and long-distance coordination of market exchange can be achieved through public-private cooperation." ],

Ultimately, through exploring objects' affordances, our relationship to them develops into a routinised practice we no longer reflect on them. Hair care is universal and (often) an ‘ordinary’ part of our daily routines. Our cleanliness routines consume resources and therefore are implicated in the issue of environmental sustainability. However, routines are complex and\ndifficult to change when they are set in a culture of individual consumer choice. The disorder inherent in the process of appropriation raises the possibility that design might deliberately create a useful ‘disorder’ in routinised practices to facilitate sustainable strategies in everyday life.\n  The paper proposes an approach of investigating routinised practices in relation to deliberately creating disorder in everyday routines and practice theory. Further, it outlines a pilot study that uses the designled method of 'probes' and considers its potentials in generating disorder. It identifies creative disorder in the process of designers developing the probes, participants interacting with them to finally designers receiving the results. Thinking about the process in terms of disorder is seen to be valuable in facilitating, applying and\ndeveloping probes, not only to inspire the designer but also to sensitise the designer to private and intimate areas of everyday life such as hair care.</p>" ],

  "texts" : [ "Exploring the spectrum of 3-M syndrome, a primordial short stature disorder of disrupted ubiquitination.", "3-M syndrome is an autosomal recessive primordial growth disorder characterized by small birth size and post-natal growth restriction associated with a spectrum of minor anomalies (including a triangular-shaped face, flat cheeks, full lips, short chest and prominent fleshy heels). Unlike many other primordial short stature syndromes, intelligence is normal and there is no other major system involvement, indicating that 3-M is predominantly a growth-related condition. From an endocrine perspective, serum GH levels are usually normal and IGF-I normal or low, while growth response to rhGH therapy is variable but typically poor. All these features suggest a degree of resistance in the GH-IGF axis. To date, mutations in three genes CUL7, OBSL1 and CCDC8 have been shown to cause 3-M. CUL7 acts an ubiquitin ligase and is known to interact with p53, cyclin D-1 and the growth factor signalling molecule IRS-1, the link with the latter may contribute to the GH-IGF resistance. OBSL1 is a putative cytoskeletal adaptor that interacts with and stabilizes CUL7. CCDC8 is the newest member of the pathway and interacts with OBSL1 and, like CUL7, associates with p53, acting as a co-factor in p53-medicated apoptosis. 3-M patients without a mutation have also been identified, indicating the involvement of additional genes in the pathway. Potentially damaging sequence variants in CUL7 and OBSL1 have been identified in idiopathic short stature (ISS), including those born small with failure of catch-up growth, signifying that the 3-M pathway could play a wider role in disordered growth." ],

I argue that the appropriate context of the non-realists understanding of religious belief is provided by philosophical pragmatism as this is presented in the work of John Dewey and Richard Rorty. This context outlines important aspects of the 'Sea of Faith' religious non-realists' self-understanding; and provides them with an argumentative resource which they can employ against alternative critical-realist approaches to religious belief I show that John Dewey's understanding of religious faith coheres with many of the ideas expressed by religious non-realists and that Rorty's  pragmatism  provides  religious  non-realism   with  a contemporary philosophical articulation of its theology. In order to defend this assertion I argue that Rorty's pragmatism does not necessarily lead to radical subjectivism nor to a dangerous political ideology as some interpreters have suggested. Further, I argue that his ideas are open to theological appropriation and that his rejection of religious belief is tempered by a tolerance toward those who still find a use for it. Rorty, I claim, has such a use. He employs the term 'God' as a backdrop against which he can present his own account of a pragmatic culture. I show that his work contains positive references to the influence that religious belief has had on the development of such a culture and argue that this pragmatic culture fits well with a non-realist understanding of religious belief" ],

  "texts" : [ "Bumiputera Institution and the Development of Corporate Governance in Malaysia", "Realizing the limitations of economic theories in explaining corporate governance practices, this thesis adopts an institutional approach in its attempt to understand how such issues are shaped by larger institutional contexts. Malaysia is used as a case study; and accordingly the influence of a dominant institution of Bumiputera (sons of the soil) on corporate governance practices is investigated. The thesis focuses on the emergence, institutionalization impact, and change of the Bumiputera institution; and how corporate governance practices are influenced in each stage. As a lens for analysis, this thesis integrates sociological and historical paradigms of the new institutionalisms, and extends Beckert’s (2010) framework to include the role of power as advanced by Steven Lukes (1974, 2005). This extended framework is useful in explaining how the reciprocal influence of the Bumiputera institution, social networks, cognition, and power affect the behaviour of corporate governance actors. \tThe analysis shows that, following the commitment by the state towards Bumiputera, the Malays’ equity ownership has seen a progressive increase, although it failed to meet the specified target of 30%. Malays’ representation on corporate boards also increased. The commitment has also led to a strong state presence in the economy, through its involvement in the Government Linked Companies, established to pursue Bumiputera’s objectives. However, unintended consequences have arisen affecting both ownership and appointment. The analysis also shows that, while board appointment is largely based on social networks, the existence of the Bumiputera institution means that ethnicity matters. Appointment could be for political or legitimacy reasons. Heightened by liberalisation moves, both Bumiputera and corporate governance institutions are subject to change. However, this refers only to the regulative aspects of the institutions, which are more susceptible to change compared to their informal elements. The state’s commitment towards Bumiputera remains. This study contributes to corporate governance literature by providing evidence on how corporate governance institutions are influenced by the larger social-political and institutional context vis-à-vis the emerging economy. This study shows that: firstly, corporate governance practices are shaped by history and political contexts; hence, understanding history would enhance the understanding of corporate governance. Secondly, ownership structure and the board of directors are not just mechanisms of corporate governance; rather, they are also channels through which larger objectives, including social objectives, are being pursued. Finally, this institution of corporate governance is not driven by functional needs of capital providers, but is shaped by powerful actors. Corporate governance practices are not intended just for resolving a particular agency problem, but are a mode of response to a particular historical incident that developed in postcolonial Malaysia." ],

  "texts" : [ "Spiritual belief, social support, physical functioning and depression among older people in Bulgaria and Romania", "Objectives: An exploratory investigation is reported into the role of spirituality and religious practice in protecting against depression among older people living in rural villages in Bulgaria and Romania, two neighbouring countries with similar cultural, political and religious histories, but with differing levels of current religiosity. Methods: In both countries, interviews were conducted with samples of 160 persons of 60 years and over in villages of similar socio-economic status. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression-D scale and the Royal Free Interview for Religious and Spiritual Beliefs were used to assess depression and spiritual belief and practice respectively. In addition social support, physical functioning and the presence of chronic diseases were assessed. One year later, follow-up interviews were conducted with 58 of the original sample in Bulgaria, in which additional measures of depression and of spiritual belief and practice were also included. Results: The study demonstrates, as expected, significantly lower levels of spiritual belief in the Bulgarian sample (Bulgarian mean 29.7 (SD = 19.1), Romanian mean 47.6 (SD = 11.2), t = 10.2, p < 0.001), as well as significantly higher levels of depression (Bulgarian mean 12.0 (SD = 4.9), Romanian mean 7.3 (SD = 4.1), t = 9.3, p < 0.001), the latter attributable in large part to higher morbidity and disability rates, but less evidently to differences in strength of belief. However, analyses from both the cross-sectional study and the one-year follow-up of the Bulgarian sample do suggest that spiritual belief and practice may both influence and reflect physical and mental illness. Conclusions: Much of Eastern Europe displays high rates of depression among its older population and provides opportunities for investigation of the role of religious belief and practice in preventing and coping with depression. Further research is encouraged in populations of diverse religiosity" ],

The word “simulate” means ‘imitate the appearance or character of’ and ‘pretend to have or feel (an emotion)’ (Google a, 2012). A computer facilitates the relationship between a consumer and the pure-play retailer and cannot feel; therefore the relationship cannot exist in a real way and only exists in the eyes of the consumer. Just as a simulator is used for pleasure rides, such as flights or rocket ships, the flight does not exist, but is simulated by a computer and a director who ensures the film starts simultaneously with motion. The same is true for the relationship between a pure-play retailer and a consumer, it is not real, and therefore it is appropriately“simulated”.Descriptive statistics set the scene for a following body of multivariate statistical analysis (EFA, CFA and SEM) using AMOS 16.0. 15 hypothesized relationships are tested after being generated from an extensive literature review. A sample of 688 female young fashion consumers from The University of Manchester participated in this study.There is clear variability in the build up of attachment when a consumer shops for products communicated via different marketing media. Different facets of attachment can be simulated by using static product presentation, moving product presentation and guidance. Community tools can be used to fuel product viewing in rich media and moving formats whilst acting as a discursive platform. Static product presentation has direct relationships with trust and purchase intention, whereas moving product presentations are related to building loyalty.Generalisation of results is limited due to the use of an exclusively female, student sample and the centrality on the UK fashion industry. Further development of the constructs used in this study is needed to further test the conceptual model.This study is one of the first to empirically study pure-play fashion retailing, providing insightful and pragmatic advice by identifying which communication mediums foster enduring relationships with young fashion consumers." ],

  "texts" : [ "SCHOOL CHOICE-MAKING, MOTHERS’ INVOLVEMENT IN CHILDREN’S EDUCATION AND SOCIAL REPRODUCTION IN THE EDUCATION MARKET IN HONG KONG", "This study examines the mechanisms of class disadvantage in educational processes in Hong Kong by focusing on mothers’ secondary school choice-making and everyday educational involvement. My study is located within the context of local neoliberal education reforms in which parents are expected to rely on their own resources to support their children’s learning and all-round development and to exercise school choice. I have drawn upon cultural capital theory and applied to the local context in order to explore how patterns of persistent class differentials in educational outcomes despite expanded educational opportunities are produced in micro-level processes in the local school market. I have also drawn on the insights of the Western literature about how ‘ethnicity’ and gender complicate class processes, and used these to address these issues in the local Hong Kong context. To achieve this, I interviewed 34 local-born and mainland Chinese immigrant mothers, with children aged 11-15, who mostly come from working class and intermediate class backgrounds. My findings about mothers’ educational practices show that class mechanisms generate disadvantage by restricting the access of more disadvantaged mothers to the ‘right’ cultural capital as stipulated by the particular ‘rules of the game’ of the local educational ‘field’. At the same time, my study sheds light on the diversity of the structural and moral contexts in which cultural capital mobilization is embedded and the myriad ways that ‘ethnicity’ and gender interact to aggravate, mitigate, or ameliorate class disadvantage. I underline the need for local researchers to spell out and problematize the institutionalization of class privilege and disadvantage within the education system. At the same time, the study makes a novel contribution to the wider literature by offering an account of class reproduction in Hong Kong which is different in important respects to that found in many other generic accounts which take as their focus advanced ‘Western’ capitalist societies. My findings also highlight the importance of examining the contextual contingency of how cultural capital ‘works’ and so stress the indeterminacy of class processes." ],

  "texts" : [ "Towards a cloud-based integrity measurement service", "The aim of this paper is to propose the use of a cloud-based integrity management service coupled with a trustworthy client component – in the form of the Trust Extension Device (TED) platform – as a means to to increase the quality of the security evaluation of a client. Thus, in addition to performing authentication of the client (e.g. as part of Single Sign-On), the Identity Provider asks that the integrity of the client platform be computed and then be evaluated by a trustworthy and independent Cloud-based Integrity Measurement Service (cIMS). The TED platform has been previously developed based on the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), and allows the integrity measurement of the client environment to be conducted and reported in a secure manner. Within the SSO flow, the portable TED device performs an integrity measurement of the client platform, and sends an integrity report to the cIMS as part of the client authentication process. The cIMS validates the measurements performed by the TED device, and reports a trust score to the Identity Provider (IdP). The IdP takes into account the reported trust score when the IdP computes and issues a Level of Assurance (LOA) value to the client platform. In this way the Service Provider obtains a greater degree of assurance that the client’s computing environment is relatively free of unrecognized and/or unauthorized components." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Using The Views Of Marginalised Students About Effective Teaching", "Schools often find problem behaviour difficult to address due to an overabundance of research and methods in this area.  For a variety of reasons, wavering on this matter is based on multiple reform initiatives that compete and intersect.  A solution to this indecisiveness finds a high proportion of adolescents, who are considered to be deviant by their teachers, excluded from mainstream classes and placed in alternative learning environments. These placements promise academic intervention, but tend to only address issues of self‐esteem through behaviour modification.  As a result, these students remain in a skills‐deficit position that threatens their self‐esteem and provokes their original deviance.  The study reported in this thesis considers this issue and its relationship to student voice.  In so doing, it challenges exclusion as a way of addressing negative behaviour by looking at school experiences from the perspectives of students considered to be deviant to discover and examine the common places where they have found success.Bearing this argument in mind, this one-year study set out to find areas in a school in the United States that students labeled with a behaviour difficulty might identify as positive learning environments. The specific focus was designing and implementing a methodology that used action research to more accurately identify literature to address the specific needs and concerns of the students under scrutiny. It used school tours to help participants identify areas of success, as a basis for interviews, and as a direction for teacher observations. The voices of these marginalized students produced common categories that identified possible paths to reform. They were able to identify several successful components of lesson planning and general concerns that challenged the school’s culture. The implications of these findings are a significant step forward to what we know about the workings of inclusive classrooms, the teachers who find success in them, and how students come to be labeled with a behaviour difficulty." ],

  "texts" : [ "Eco-literacy : the \"missing paradigm\" in environmental education", "This thesis is about the knowledge and beliefs of primary school teachers. The study is aimed at assessing the scope and range of Queensland primary school teachers' knowledge and beliefs about environmental education. More specifically, the thesis addresses a perceived gap within environmental education research and literature which, to date, fails to provide an elaborate account of Australian primary school teachers' knowledge about and beliefs towards environmental education.\nIn Chapter One, the Background to the Study and Review of Literature, I present an overview of the various international environmental education policy developments and initiatives, and reveal that there are established goals, objectives and principles for environmental education. In Australia, environmental education policies have been developed, although state departments have been slow to incorporate environmental education into key curriculum documents. Environmental education is predominately incorporated into and practised through existing curriculum areas; principally the 'Studies of Society and the Environment' (SOSE) key learning area. The implications of concentrating environmental education into specific curriculum domains are yet to be fully explored.\nThere are a variety of disparate views about the proper role of environmental education. In Australia, the dominant approaches are: education about the environment, education in (or through) the environment and education for the environment. For the past two decades education for the environ-ment has been identified by particular proponents in the field as the preferred approach for environ-mental education. Notwithstanding, there is a growing number of researchers who argue that education for the environment is theoretically and conceptually flawed. Four issues have been identified as the basis of these criticisms. These are: its indoctrination and anthropocentric tendencies; its definitive usage of the concept sustainable development; its inappropriate use of social-critical theory; and the lack of empirical research concerning the implementation of education for the environment in schools. To this end, I argue that the field of environmental education is characterized by theoretical assumptions, flaws and contradictions and a dearth of empirical research.\nTo this extent, little is known about the extent to which environmental education has been incorporated into school systems, particularly in primary schools. Despite the various policy advancements in environ-mental education, the evaluation studies that have been conducted indicate that policy expectations are rarely met. There are many barriers which impede the implementation of environmental education, namely: time and resource constraints for teachers; lack of teacher knowledge and skills; lack of knowledge of departmental regulations regarding environmental education; and differences and gaps between the theories (with respect to environmental education) held by policy makers, curriculum developers and educational researchers and the theories held by practitioners. In this way, environmental education research has tended to conclude that the provision of further or restructured teacher education is the 'priority of priorities' for environmental education. However, such propositions tend to be based on both a lack of empirical evidence and a flawed theoretical presumption that environmental education and the structure, politics and organisation of school systems are unprob-lematic.\nThe identified theoretical and empirical 'gaps' formulated the impetus and justification of this study. In so doing, Chapter Two presents a theoretical framework for the thesis problem set out in Chapter One. This framework is utilised later in the thesis for the interpretation, analysis and synthesis of data reported in Chapter Four. The theoretical framework establishes links between the major concepts of teachers' knowledge, teachers' beliefs and environmental education. As such, complex pedagogical content knowledge underpins the conceptual framework of this thesis, which is positioned within a theoretical model based upon ecoliteracy and adaptive management. Eco-literacy comprises complex pedagogical knowledge centred on ecological, sociological and educational concepts. Adaptive management, in addition, shows what happens with individual learners and the capacities of teachers with the practical interest of conceptualising how an ecologically literate population might be developed through participation in an education system.\nChapter Three outlines the combined-methods approach utilised to investigate primary school teachers' knowledge and beliefs (eco-literacy) about environmental education. To this extent, the methodological approach consisted of two stages. For stage one, a total of twenty-six primary school teachers volunteered and partici-pated in one intensive ethnographic interview. So as to elucidate the findings discovered in the stage one phase of data collection, a quantitative survey (stage two) was administered in five Education Queensland state primary school districts.\nIn Chapter Four I present and analyse the data collected in 'Stage One' and 'Stage Two' of this study. The data are presented in four sections, namely: Teachers' Preparedness; Teachers' Knowledge; Teachers' Beliefs; and Correlating Teachers' Preparedness, Knowledge & Beliefs - A Path Analysis. In short, the data revealed that the participants: had received no or very little in-service and/or pre-service training in environmental education; possessed mis-conceptions and simple understandings of environmental education and environmental concepts; either did not practise environmental education or practised it incidentally through curriculum areas such as Studies of Society and Environment; did not consider it a priority in their teaching or in schooling generally; perceived time constraints, over-crowded curriculum, constant change and ongoing pro-fessional demands as the major barriers preventing and/or limiting the implementation of environmental education; revealed a general concern for the environment, although various views about the environ-mental crisis were apparent (between stage one and stage two); and displayed a range of environ-mental philosophies, with participants agreeing most with the 'Ecocentric Eco-socialist' and 'Ecocentric Gaia' perspectives. Essentially, the participants' knowledge, beliefs and amount of in-service training significantly influenced their priority for and level of intention to implement environmental education in the primary school classroom. Significant trends are also reported between male and female teachers of different age-groups.\nIn Chapter Five I synthesis the data, presented in Chapter Four, in relation to the theoretical framework and overall research problem. Based upon the data presented, I contend that current primary school teachers are likely to be functioning at a level of eco-illiteracy and/or nominal eco-literacy. I conclude that the introduction of eco-literacy in educational policy and the espousal of adaptive management strategies may advance the goals of environmental education, although such initiatives are unlikely to significantly change the current 'status' of environmental education unless there is a system-wide commitment to environmental education and knowledge management on the part of governments, education departments, pre-service and in-service teacher education providers, schools and teachers themselves." ],

  "title" : "Health Capital and Finance",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Health Capital and Finance", "In corporate finance, we study the investment decisions of firms. Most of the time we focus on investments in physical capital, but firms also invest in human capital. A major component of human capital is health capital, and firms already spend a large amount of money on the health of their employees. In 2005, for example, employers in the United States spent more than $500 billion on group health insurance, which firms use to invest in their workers' health capital. Corporate finance has not yet analyzed health expenditures as an investment. This research on health and human capital complements the corporate finance literature on investment in physical capital. Additionally, the results have important welfare implications, which may aid policymakers.In the first chapter, I show how a firm's health capital investment depends on each employee's human capital, labor productivity, and firm size. Firms mitigate depreciation in a worker's human capital by investing in health to increase the productivity of human and physical capital. Results indicate that firms that have higher labor productivity, are larger, and spend more on research and development invest more in health capital. I estimate the subsequent effect of health capital investment on value using firm-level data on health insurance premiums. To identify the effect, I instrument for health insurance premiums with a time series of state health insurance mandates, state birth rates, and the number of persons covered by health insurance contracts. The marginal effect of health capital investment on firm value is zero, suggesting that firms are in equilibrium with respect to health capital investment. Market to book reflects the value of this investment because health capital is an intangible asset that the book value of assets does not capture. These results have implications for policymakers who target the employer-based system of health insurance provision as both a means of extending coverage and managing utilization.In the second chapter, I present a model of the health capital investment decision of a firm using a moral hazard framework. Health capital investment increases the probability that a worker is present and productive. The firm cannot verify a worker's health capital investment decision. When a firm invests in health capital, the investment is verifiable because the firm contracts with the insurer. I derive the optimal contract for when the worker and for when the firm invests in health capital. When the firm invests in health capital, the level of investment is higher, wages are less volatile, and wages are higher relative to when the worker invests in health capital. I discuss the welfare implications. In my model, firms invest more than workers because of a production externality and because it is less costly to invest in health capital than to compensate the worker for bearing the risk of an uncertain labor realization. This result improves welfare, contrary to the benchmark that workers consume more health care than is efficient ex post when firms provide health insurance. Unlike the benchmark model of a worker and insurer, my model includes a profit maximizing firm, includes an endogenous probability of getting sick, and allows the insurer to set premiums by anticipating the health care investment level of the insured.In the third chapter, I discuss how firms hedge risky human capital with health benefit plans. Firms can choose to fully hedge by contracting with an insurance company, remain unhedged by funding benefits out of general assets, or partially hedge by using a combination of insurance and the general assets of the firm. I adapt the model of Froot, Scharfstein, and Stein (1993) to explore the firm's hedging decision. Consistent with the predictions of the model, firms that find external finance costly and that face a convex tax schedule are more likely to hedge. Additionally, the effect of cash flow on investment is lower for firms that partially hedge human capital risk." ],

  "texts" : [ "Essays on Capital Flows, Crises and Economic Performance", "This thesis explores three important factors that have been central to the pursuit of economic development in developing countries, particularly those in Africa. These are capital flows, economic integration and financial crises.   Chapter 1 examines the causes and consequences of capital flight in African countries. Building on standard portfolio choice model, the study links the phenomenon of capital flight to the domestic investment climate (broadly defined) and shows that African agents move their portfolios abroad as a result of a deteriorating domestic investment climate where the risk-adjusted rate of return is unfavourable. The results presented suggest that economic risk, policy distortions and the poor profitability of African investments explain the variation in capital flight. In addition, employing a PVAR and its corresponding impulse responses, the chapter shows that capital flight shocks worsen economic performance.   Chapter 2 explores the (independent) effects of crises and openness on a large sample of African countries using dynamic panel techniques. Focusing on sudden stops, currency, twin and sovereign debt crises, the chapter shows that economic crises are associated with growth collapses in Africa. In contrast, economic openness is found to be beneficial to growth. More importantly, we find that, consistent with standard Mundell-Flemming type models and sticky-price open economy models, greater openness to trade and financial flows mitigates the adverse effects of crises.   In the final chapter, we examine whether capital flows such as FDI, foreign aid and migrant remittances crowd-in or crowd-out domestic investment in developing countries. Applying recently developed panel cointegration techniques which can handle cross-sectional heterogeneity, serial correlation and endogeneity, we find that FDI and remittances have a positive and significant effect on domestic investment in the long-run while aid tends to act as a substitute for investment. We also conduct panel Granger causality analysis and find that the effect of FDI on investment is both transitory as well as permanent. That is, it tends to crowd-in domestic investment both in the short-run and in the long-run. We do not find any causal links between foreign aid and investment. The results show that, while remittances do not have causal effects on investment in the short-run, there is a bidirectional (causal) relationship between the two in the long-run." ],
