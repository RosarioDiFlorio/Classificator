The winter northeast monsoon has\nmoderate wind forcing and a strongly destabilizing surface buoyancy flux, driven by large\nradiative and latent heat losses at the sea surface. Convective entrainment is the primary\nlocal mechanism driving the observed mixed layer cooling and deepening, although horizontal\nadvection of thermocline depth variations affect the depth which the mixed layer\nattains. Modifications of a one-dimensional mixed layer model and heat balance show that\nthe primary nonlocal forcing of the upper ocean is the horizontal advection of temperature\ngradients below the mixed layer base. The summer southwest monsoon has strong wind\nstresses and a neutral to stabilizing surface buoyancy flux, limited by the extreme humidity\nof the atmosphere, which suppresses both the radiative and latent heat losses at the surface.\nWind-driven shear instabilities at the base of the mixed layer, which entrain cooler\nand fresher water primarily produces the observed mixed layer cooling and deepening.\nHorizontal advection of cooler water within the mixed layer influences the local heat balance\nat the mooring site.

It has also been shown that conversion of PFC droplets to microbubbles improves ultrasound (US) sensitivity to emulsions by 10 orders of magnitude. PFC droplets, with their higher boiling point and smaller particle size are more desirable to prevent spontaneous aporization and maximum accumulation of emulsions. However, the high US energy required to induce phase conversion in these emulsions is not clinically feasible. We hypothesized that by increasing the temperature and using Iron-oxide nanoparticles(IONP) as nucleation sites within the more stable and submicron droplets, the US energy required to vaporize them may be lowered. Material and method: A sample of 60%w/v iron-oxide loaded PFC droplets with mean diameter of 200nm was manufactured and characterized. A phantom was designed to allow for the interaction between the US energy and droplets. A high intensity focused ultrasound system (HIFU) was used to generate US pressures and a heat exchanger pump was used to control the temperature while emulsions of PFHB and PFP with or without IONP were circulated through the chamber. A harmonic imaging system was also used to detect the generated microbubbles. Discussion and result: The effect of temperature and IONP on the vaporization rate and threshold of PFC emulsions were determined. It was shown that presence of IONP and higher temperature increase the rate and decreases the vaporization threshold of PFC emulsions", null ],

Schultz</div></p><div style=\"text-align: center;\">Crystallographic Analysis of a Hammerhead Ribozyme Variant and Its Impact on Catalytic Activity</div></p>Over the past two decades, the hammerhead ribozyme has been extensively studied leading to many new insights regarding the biochemical and structural properties of catalytic RNAs.  Despite these insights, the role metal ions in catalysis is still of great debate.  We have obtained a 1.55Å crystal structure of a hammerhead ribozyme from <em>Schistosoma mansoni</em> in conditions that permit detailed observation of Na<sup>+</sup> ions binding in the ribozyme's active site.  A Na<sup>+</sup> ion binds to the N7 of G10.1 and the adjacent A9 phosphate in a manner identical to that previously observed for divalent cations.  A second Na<sup>+</sup> ion binds to the Hoogsteen face of G12, the general base in the hammerhead ribozyme cleavage reaction, thereby potentially dissipating the negative charge of the catalytically active enolate form of the base.  We have also obtained a 2.2Å crystal structure of a hammerhead ribozyme variant containing adenine substituted for the general base that displays a structurally perturbed active site.  Our results suggest that Na<sup>+</sup> directly and specifically substitutes for divalent cations in the hammerhead active site.  Additionally, we suggest that hammerhead ribozyme substituted with adenine for the general base may compete between two conformational states: an active state in which A12 is situated for deprotonation of the 2'H of C17; and an inactive state in which A12 makes a non-canonical base pair A9, causing a perturbation in the active site, disrupting metal ion binding.  These results permit us to estimate the contribution that structural perturbation has on the catalytic activity of other hammerhead ribozyme variants containing nucleobase substitutions for the general base.", null ],

Primed T cells are required for virus clearance, but are causally implicated in the enhanced pathology seen following RSV infection of some infants and experimental animals vaccinated against the virus. In BALB/c mice, vaccination with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the viral attachment protein (G) leads to pulmonary eosinophilia during subsequent infection, which indirect evidence suggests may be due to CD4+ Th2 cells. The production of IFN-gamma, IL-2, -4, -5 and -10 cytokine mRNA by RT-PCR and intracellular cytokines by flow cytometry following RSV challenge of vaccinated mice were therefore compared. Lung eosinophilia was associated with enhanced local recruitment of CD4+ cells in G sensitized mice, while CD8+ cells dominated in mice vaccinated with the viral fusion protein (F) or second matrix protein (M2). Lung eosinophilia was also associated with a localized reduction in IFN-gamma and increased IL-4 and IL-5 mRNA transcription as well as elevated RSV specific IgG1 antibody production. Th2 cytokine protein production by T cells showed no apparent change. Although IFN-gamma production diminished in eosinophilic mice, it remained the major cytokine found in lung T cells. It was concluded that lung eosinophilia can develop despite abundant IFN-gamma production by local T cells, but is associated with a shift in the balance between Th2 and Th1 cytokine production.", null ],

  "texts" : [ "Thermal Characterization of Nanostructures and Advanced Engineered Materials", "Continuous downscaling of Si complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology and progress in high-power electronics demand more efficient heat removal techniques to handle the increasing power density and rising temperature of hot spots. For this reason, it is important to investigate thermal properties of materials at nanometer scale and identify materials with the extremely large or extremely low thermal conductivity for applications as heat spreaders or heat insulators in the next generation of integrated circuits. The thin films used in microelectronic and photonic devices need to have high thermal conductivity in order to transfer the dissipated power to heat sinks more effectively. On the other hand, thermoelectric devices call for materials or structures with low thermal conductivity because the performance of thermoelectric devices is determined by the figure of merit Z=S^2e/K, where S is the Seebeck coefficient, K and e are the thermal and electrical conductivity, respectively. Nanostructured superlattices can have drastically reduced thermal conductivity as compared to their bulk counterparts making them promising candidates for high-efficiency thermoelectric materials. Other applications calling for thin films with low thermal conductivity value are high-temperature coatings for engines. Thus, materials with both high thermal conductivity and low thermal conductivity are technologically important. The increasing temperature of the hot spots in state-of-the-art chips stimulates the search for innovative methods for heat removal. One promising approach is to incorporate materials, which have high thermal conductivity into the chip design. Two suitable candidates for such applications are diamond and graphene. Another approach is to integrate the high-efficiency thermoelectric elements for on-spot cooling. In addition, there is strong motivation for improved thermal interface materials (TIMs) for heat transfer from the heat-generating chip to heat-sinking units. This dissertation presents results of the experimental investigation and theoretical interpretation of thermal transport in the advanced engineered materials, which include thin films for thermal management of nanoscale devices, nanostructured superlattices as promising candidates for high-efficiency thermoelectric materials, and improved TIMs with graphene and metal particles as fillers providing enhanced thermal conductivity. The advanced engineered materials studied include chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown ultra-nanocrystalline diamond (UNCD) and microcrystalline diamond (MCD) films on Si substrates, directly integrated nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) films on GaN, free-standing polycrystalline graphene (PCG) films, graphene oxide (GOx) films, and \"pseudo-superlattices\" of the mechanically exfoliated Bi2Te3 topological insulator films, and thermal interface materials (TIMs) with graphene fillers.", null ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Characterization of Chemical and Mechanical Properties of Polymer Based Nanocomposites", "Characterization of Chemical and Mechanical Properties of Polymer Based NanocompositesThe University of ManchesterTamer Wafy Doctor of Philosophy17 January, 2013One of the most significant issues in nanocomposite performance is improving the dispersion of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in thermosetting or thermoplastic polymers in order to gain good mechanical properties. Several studies have investigated the fabrication of nanocomposites based on carbon nanotubes and analysed properties, but there is still insufficient data on their structure-property relationships. This thesis has investigated the central importance of stress transfer Raman studies in epoxy composites reinforced with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) and multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to elucidate the reinforcing ability of the CNTs in an epoxy matrix. This project was undertaken to synthesise and characterize MWCNTs and determine the effect of different weight fractions of untreated MWCNTs on the stress transfer efficiency at the MWCNTS / epoxy interface and on the stiffness of the thermomechanical properties of the MWCNTS / epoxy composites. It was undertaken to assess the stress transfer efficiency at the CNT / epoxy interface and at the inter-walls of the CNTs with tensile deformation and with cyclic loading.Optimized conditions of the injection chemical vapour deposition method (CVD), such as long injection times were applied to produce MWCNTs with a high yield, high aspect ratio and well-defined G' Raman peak. The morphology and size of CNTs were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) while their thermal stability was examined by Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Both Raman spectroscopy and mechanical testing (static and dynamic) were utilized in this study. The Raman spectroscopy research consisted of following the G'-band frequency and linewidth as well as the intensity of radial breathing modes (RBMs) during tensile deformation. The stress-induced Raman shifts in the nanocomposites have been shown to be controlled by the number of carbon nanolayers. A theory has been developed to determine and simulate the stress transfer efficiency parameter, (k_i) for MWCNTs. Tensile tests and dynamic mechanical testing were used to assess the mechanical properties of the nanocomposites.The most obvious finding to be drawn from the present study is that the reinforcement of the epoxy resin with different loadings of MWCNTs is useful, but the best reinforcement was at low loadings of MWCNTs. One of the more significant findings to emerge from this study is that (k_i) between the inner walls of the DWCNTs and MWCNTs are quite similar (~0.7), which suggest that (k_i)  may be similar for all CVD MWCNTs and DWCNTs. The second major finding was that there were RBM intensity variations for the SWCNTs and DWCNTs in the hot-cured epoxy composites and that for the DWCNTs both the inner and outer nanotube walls are stressed during deformation", null ],

We further demonstrate a central role for DC IL-4Rα expression in the optimal induction of IFNγ responses in vivo in both Th1 and Th2 settings, through a feedback loop in which IL-4 promotes DC secretion of IL-12. Finally, we reveal a central role for RELMα during T-cell priming, establishing that its expression by DCs is critical for optimal IL-10 and IL-13 promotion in vitro and in vivo.

  "texts" : [ "Structural brain imaging evidence for multiple pathological processes at different stages of brain development in schizophrenia.", "The underlying neurobiology of emerging psychotic disorders is not well understood. While there is evidence from structural imaging and other studies supporting the popular notion that schizophrenia arises as a consequence of an \"early neurodevelopmental\" lesion, more recent findings challenge this notion. Evidence, including our own data, suggests that dynamic brain changes occur during the earliest stages of a psychotic illness, including around the time of transition to illness. In this article we review the available longitudinal and relevant cross-sectional structural neuroimaging studies focusing on both the very early neurodevelopmental markers (pre- or perinatal origin) and the later markers (late neurodevelopmental) around the period of transition to illness. Based on our review of recent findings, we suggest that the onset of psychosis is a time of active brain changes, wherein, for a proportion of individuals, (i) an early (pre- and perinatal) neurodevelopmental lesion renders the brain vulnerable to anomalous late (particularly postpubertal) neurodevelopmental processes, as indicated by evidence for accelerated loss of gray matter and aberrant connectivity particularly in prefrontal regions; and (ii) these anomalous neurodevelopmental processes interact with other causative factors associated with the onset of psychosis (e.g., substance use, stress, and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function), which together have neuroprogressive sequelae involving medial temporal and orbital prefrontal regions, as suggested by imaging studies around transition to active illness. However, the pathological processes underlying such progressive changes during \"late neurodevelopment\" remain unclear but may reflect anomalies of synaptic plasticity, abnormal brain maturation, the adverse effects of stress, or other environmental factors. In this context, the features of schizophrenia, including the neuropsychological deficits and behavioral manifestations, can be understood as direct effects of these multiple pathological processes at various neurodevelopmental stages, including genetic and nongenetic etiological factors.", null ],

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) remains one of the most exciting techniques that allows for real-time data collection and label free detection amenable to many biological systems. This thesis focuses on the development of novel sensing interfaces/materials for biomolecular interaction analysis (BIA) with SPR and SPR imaging (SPRi).The first half of this work focuses on the development of unique surface chemistry designs to examine biological interactions. Firstly, in an effort to augment understanding of lectin (protein)-carbohydrate interactions, SPR spectroscopy is used to display differential binding of lectins to various synthetic carbohydrates. This biointerface was later adapted to a high-density array format for SPR imaging detection. Secondly, to expand the use of SPR to large bioparticle detection another interface based on the generation of a mass-enhancing product at the sensing interface for highly sensitive and fast detection of <italic>E. coli</italic> is presented. Results indicate a multi-fold signal enhancement of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells in buffer and on spinach leaves.The second part of this thesis focuses on the development of new substrates for both SPR and SPR imaging experiments. Firstly, the fabrication of ultra-thin (ca. 5-8 nm) glass layers on top of a gold surface for SPR biosensing applications is demonstrated. This nanoglassy layer is created by employing a high-pressure, low-volume paint gun technique, resulting in ultra-thin and fracture-free substrates for biosensing applications including monitoring membrane protein interactions in real-time. Finally, the facile fabrication of gold-coated etched glass substrates for SPR imaging that reduces background resonance 5-fold <italic>in situ</italic> compared to the standard gold island array platform is presented. The etching of the glass substrate induces a variation in the resonance condition and thus in the resonance angle between the etched wells and the surrounding area, leading to the isolation of the array spot resonance with a significant reduction of the background resonance. Additionally, these chips enhance the SPR evanescent field intensity 3-fold compared to standard planar gold chips and significantly enhance SPR imaging surface sensitivity.", null ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "The regulation of global deSUMOylation by human SUMO- specific proteases", "SUMOylation - the covalent tagging of a target protein with a SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier) molecule - has recently emerged as an important post-translational modification in regulating a wide array of biological events. SUMOylation is a dynamics process, where SUMO- specific proteases (SENPs) process proSUMO molecules and also deconjugate them from substrates. My dissertation focuses on the deconjugating activity of SENPs and addresses the role they play in regulating the global SUMOylation \"status quo\" of eukaryotic cells. SENPs are among the most specific proteases and only cleave SUMO molecules, yet they exhibit substantial substrate specificity among SUMO paralogs. To address the deconjugating specificities of human SENPs, I developed two different proteomics strategies to profile these proteases. One method has the potential to identify lysines of SUMOylation, besides the SUMOylation substrate itself, while the other can differentiate SUMOylated substrates from SUMO-interactors. To this end, I demonstrated the proof-of-principle of both methods and have identified polySUMOylated substrates. Such polySUMOylation (ie: modification of proteins by SUMO chains) has been an elusive phenomenon to study. In fact, so far, mainly mass spectrometry has shed light on the nature of SUMO chains through identifying SUMO-SUMO isopeptides. Thus, in the bulk of my dissertation, using a conjugatable, but not deconjugatable SUMO, I demonstrate the abundance of SUMO chains in vivo, make them visually appreciable and uncover the rapid dynamics of SUMOylation through their deconjugation. I propose that the balance of the dynamics is largely due to the action of SENPs in constantly cleaving SUMO from its targets, whether from a target protein or from another SUMO. This way, SENPs guard the SUMOylation status of the proteome, which by definition includes keeping in check modification of substrates by SUMO chains. I also establish the mechanism of SUMO chain deconjugation, which I show to be stochastic. Lastly, I reiterate the importance of deSUMOylation in vivo, by showing that the lack of deSUMOylation is adversary for the growth of Schizosaccharomyces pombe under replicative stress and for human cells", null ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Characterising the Innate and Adaptive Immune Response to Intestinal Helminth infection", "Abstract Gastrointestinal parasites are one of the most prevalent infections known to infect mammals, estimated to affect over one billion people globally. It is well established that the generation of a type two response, characterised by CD4+ T cell secretion of interleukin (IL)-13, IL-4 and IL-9 will expel most gastrointestinal helminths. Expulsion is mediated by a variety of effector mechanisms including altered mucin production, intestinal mast cell activation, increased epithelial cell turnover and increased muscle contraction. Protective immunity can be generated over time; however, infections can persist to chronicity following the modulation of a protective type two response, such as the generation of a type one response. This response, characterised by IFN-γ and IL 12 secretion, can lead to long lived infections, placing huge morbidity upon infected individuals. The mechanisms leading to the generation of a type one or type two response are not fully understood and are of paramount importance if a vaccine to helminth parasites is to be developed. In addition, the dysregulation of these responses is thought to be the cause of allergy and autoimmunity and understanding the regulation of type two responses will also add to our understanding of these diseases.Numerous labs have recently reported roles for new innate cells, such as nuocytes, as sources of IL 13, a cytokine critical to worm expulsion.  In addition, data from this lab has demonstrated that NK cell derived IL-13 is the cause of pathology during infection with Trichinella spiralis. It has also been shown that NK cells provide a supplementary source of IL-13 in Trichuris muris infected IL-4-/- mice. This thesis has used 2 strains of mice; the E4bp4-/- mouse and the Il13eGFP reporter mouse, in order to dissect the role of innate cells in the immune response to the related helminth parasites T. muris and T. spiralis. The transcription factor E4BP4 has been shown to control CD4+ T cell IL-5 and 13 secretion and the development of NK cells. Data presented in this thesis shows that following a low dose infection, which usually persists to chronicity in WT mice, E4bp4-/- mice were able to expel the parasite following the generation of an elevated type two response. This effect was abrogated following CD4+ T cell depletion, indicative of an essential role for these cells in this response. It was also shown that E4BP4 ablation was sufficient to delay expulsion of a high dose of T. muris, indicative of a key role for E4BP4 in regulating type two responses to T. muris. Contrary to the hypothesis, it was demonstrated that NK cells did not play a major role in protective immunity to T. muris.In addition, the data presented here shows, for the first time, the induction of nuocytes in the MLN following both T. muris and T. spiralis infection. Nuocytes made an early contribution to IL-13 secretion following T. spiralis infection; whereas low levels of Il13eGFP+ cells were observed only at day 18-21 post T. muris infection, with nuocytes making a less significant contribution to IL-13 levels. The levels of different cell lineages in the MLN post infection and their contribution to IL-13 expression was also mapped in detail.Finally, an analysis of the haematopoietic response in the bone marrow following T. muris infection was undertaken. The percentage and number of early progenitor Lineage-Sca-1+c-kit+ (LSK) cells in the bone marrow increased at day 21 post T. muris infection.

  "texts" : [ "Evolved Error Management Biases in the Attribution of Anger", "Judgments of others' emotional states and inclinations had recurrent fitness consequences for ancestral humans. Such judgments, made under uncertainty, can result in false positives (overestimating an emotional state or trait) or false negatives (underestimating the same). When the costs of these two errors consistently and historically differed, natural selection will have favored a bias toward making the less costly error. The perception of anger entails such asymmetry. Averaged across situations over evolutionary time, underestimation of anger was the more costly error, as the fitness decrements resulting from physical harm or death due to insufficient vigilance were greater than those resulting from lost social opportunities due to excessive caution. I therefore hypothesized that selection has favored an overestimation bias in the evaluations of others' state anger and general anger-proneness (trait anger) relative to evaluations of other traits to which this error asymmetry does not apply. Moreover, I hypothesized that additional attributes which make the actor more dangerous or make the observer more vulnerable increase the error asymmetry with regard to inferring state anger and trait anger, and should therefore correspondingly increase this overestimation bias. In the study described in Chapter 2 (N = 292), models photographed with a neutral expression and holding a potentially dangerous household object were judged to be angrier than those holding a harmless object, even though the held object provided no normative information about their emotional state. In Chapter 3, Study 1 (N = 161), a fictitious individual depicted in a vignette was judged to have higher trait anger than trait disgust even after controlling for the raters' perception of how emotionally he behaved. Moreover, trait anger ratings were more responsive than trait disgust ratings to behavioral cues of emotionality. In Chapter 3, Study 2 (N = 335), participants viewed images of angry or fearful faces. The interaction of factors indicating target's formidability (male sex), target's intent to harm (direct gaze), and perceiver's vulnerability (being female or high belief in a dangerous world) increased ratings of the target's trait anger but not trait fear. In aggregate, these results suggest a domain-specific bias in evaluating anger.", null ],

The missing PNe population. 100 new objects were spectroscopically observed and analysed using the INT Photometric Halpha Survey (IPHAS). 32 are PNe, 13 are possible PNe and the rest are HII regions, SNR and unclear objects. The new PNe were within the inner parts of the galactic plane. The IPHAS survey has been the deepest survey done in Halpha, and revealed objects never seen before.2. The mixed chemistry in Galactic Bulge PNe. These GBPNe are the end-products of low-mass stars (and therefore expected to be O-rich) and belong to a metal rich population. These PNe present dual-dust chemistry, with the presence of PAHs (carbon-rich) and crystalline silicates (oxygen-rich) in their spectra. This thesis analysed 40 Galactic Bulge PNe and found a strong correlation between intensity of the PAH bands and morphology, notably a massive torus. This torus provides the dense irradiated environment needed to form the PAHs. Follow-up observations using VISIR revealed a dense dusty tori in 11 PNe. PAHs are present in the outer edges of these tori, whereas ionised material is located within the dusty tori.3. The 3He problem. Using the VLA we observed three PNe, upper-limits of their 3He abundances were estimated. The resulting evolution of 3He is only consistent with the values determined in pre-solar material and the ISM, if the PNe observed represent only 4% of the population of low-mass stars, and the remaining 96% have undergone enhanced 3He depletion.", null ],

While in transit to the lymph nodes LC are subject to both phenotypic and functional maturation which, by analogy with in vitro studies, is also effected by epidermal cytokines (granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, GM-CSF and interleukin-1, IL-1). It is now apparent that Langerhans cell function, the induction of cutaneous immune responses and effective sensitization are dependent on the availability of such cytokines and that contact allergens are able to provoke their production by keratinocytes and by Langerhans cells themselves.

A range of different proteogenomics approaches have been developed, which integrate mass spectrometry data with genome sequence data to provide empirical evidence for protein-coding genes. However, current methods may not be optimized as they do not fully consider the splicing complexity in eukaryotes and there is currently no best practice method. To address this, we investigate the level of proteomics support for Ensembl gene models in human, and a selection of model organisms. We find a disparity between the number of splice variants confirmed by extant data, and the number that can theoretically be confirmed using current proteomics technologies. We then go on to investigate EST-based proteogenomics methods, which enabled the discovery of novel peptide sequences in the chicken genome, which represent hitherto unannotated genes, amended gene models, polymorphisms, and genes missing from the genome assembly. Different approaches for searching mass spectrometry data against transcript sequences are explored, and we show that searching mass spectra against protein sequences predicted by the EORF and ESTScan2 translation tools results in the best sensitivity.", null ],

Other studies, however, indicate that the source of infection may also play a role in such phenotype. To address this question an experiment was set up in which either of two different natural scrapie sources, AAS from AA136 Suffolk and VVC from VV136 Cheviot sheep, were inoculated into AA136, VA136 and VV136 sheep recipients (n&#8201;=&#8201;52). The immunohistochemical (IHC) profile of disease-associated PrP (PrPd) accumulation in the brain of recipient sheep was highly consistent upon codon 136 homologous and semi-homologous transmission, but could be either similar to or different from those of the inoculum donors. In contrast, the IHC profiles were highly variable upon heterologous transmission (VVC to AA136 and AAS to VV136). Furthermore, sheep of the same Prnp genotype could exhibit different survival times and PrPd profiles depending on the source of infection, and a correlation was observed between IHC and Western blot profiles. It was found that additional polymorphisms at codons 112 or 141 of AA136 recipients resulted in a delayed appearance of clinical disease or even in protection from infection. The results of this study strongly suggest that the scrapie phenotype in sheep results from a complex interaction between source, donor and recipient factors, and that the Prnp genotype of the recipient sheep does not explain the variability observed upon codon 136 heterologous transmissions, arguing for other genetic factors to be involved.", null ],

  "texts" : [ "Nucleation and Cross-Slip of Partial Dislocations in FCC Metals", "Nucleation of partial dislocations at a crack and cross-slip of partial dislocations under general loading in FCC metals are analyzed based on a multiscale model which incorporates atomic information into continuum-mechanics approach. In both analyses, the crack and the slip planes are modeled as surfaces of displacement discontinuities embedded in elastic media. The atomic potentials between the adjacent atomic layers along the slip planes are assumed to be the generalized stacking fault energies, which are obtained based on atomic calculations. The relative displacements along the slip planes, corresponding to the configurations of partial dislocations and stacking faults, are solved through the variational boundary integral method. The energetics of partial dislocation nucleation at the crack and cross-slip in FCC metals Al and Cu are comparatively studied for their distinctive difference in the intrinsic stacking fault energy. For the analysis of nucleation of partial dislocations at a crack, several new features have emerged compared with nucleation of perfect dislocations in previous studies. Among them, the critical stress and activation energy for nucleation of partial dislocations are markedly lowered. Depending on the value of stacking fault energy and crack configuration, the saddle-point configurations of partial dislocations can be vastly different in terms of the nucleation sequence and the size of the stacking fault. The implications of these new findings on mechanical behavior of nanostructured crystalline materials are elaborated.For the analysis of cross-slip of partial dislocations, the conclusion from previous studies that cross-slip in FCC metals can be influenced by intrinsic stacking fault energy is confirmed. Furthermore, it is found that in Al, the preference of the gliding plane depends on the competition between the two resolved shear stresses on the slip planes. In Cu, the most preferred loading condition for cross-slip is that a lager compressing Escaig shear stress on the primary slip plane is accompanied with stretching Escaig shear stress on the cross-slip plane. The analysis of activation energy indicates that thermal motion plays an important role in cross-slip in FCC metals.", null ],

  "texts" : [ "GFI1 and GFI1B control the loss of endothelial identity of hemogenic endothelium during hematopoietic commitment.", "Recent studies have established that during embryonic development, hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells are generated from hemogenic endothelium precursors through a process termed endothelial to hematopoietic transition (EHT). The transcription factor RUNX1 is essential for this process, but its main downstream effectors remain largely unknown. Here, we report the identification of Gfi1 and Gfi1b as direct targets of RUNX1 and critical regulators of EHT. GFI1 and GFI1B are able to trigger, in the absence of RUNX1, the down-regulation of endothelial markers and the formation of round cells, a morphologic change characteristic of EHT. Conversely, blood progenitors in Gfi1- and Gfi1b-deficient embryos maintain the expression of endothelial genes. Moreover, those cells are not released from the yolk sac and disseminated into embryonic tissues. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a critical and specific role of the GFI1 transcription factors in the first steps of the process leading to the generation of hematopoietic progenitors from hemogenic endothelium.", null ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Role of Fas/Fas ligand-mediated apoptosis in murine contact hypersensitivity.", "Apoptosis plays an important role in immune responses, but little is known about its involvement in contact hypersensitivity (CH). In this study, we have investigated the role of Fas/Fas ligand (FasL)-mediated apoptosis in the pathogenesis of CH. Mice were sensitized by one topical application of 100 microl of 3% oxazolone to shaved skin of the abdomen. Six days later, CH was provoked by challenging both sides of sensitized mouse right ear with 15 microl of 1% oxazolone. Using a DNA ladder assay, we found that apoptosis was induced in the skin of oxazolone-sensitized mice 24-96 h after allergen challenge. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis flow cytometric assay showed that early apoptotic CD4(+) T cells (annexin V-FITC(+)PI(-)), but not late apoptotic CD4(+) T cells (annexin V-FITC(+)PI(+)), increased in the inflamed skin of mice with CH. Moreover, the expressions of mRNAs for T helper (Th2) cytokine (interleukin (IL)-4), Th1 cytokine (interferon (IFN)-gamma) and proapoptotic molecules (Bax, Fas, FasL and IL-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE)/caspase-1) were significantly elevated in the oxazolone-sensitized mouse skin 6-72 h after allergen challenge. Dramatic increase in IL-10 mRNA was only observed in the sensitized mouse skin 6 and 12 h after allergen challenge. Furthermore, CH was significantly inhibited with decreased apoptosis and early apoptotic CD4(+) T cells in inflamed skin in Fas mutant lpr/lpr mice compared to wild-type mice, whereas there were no significant differences in IL-4, IFN-gamma, IL-10, Bax and ICE mRNAs in the inflamed skin of CH between lpr/lpr and wild-type mice. Our results thus suggest that Fas/FasL pathway partially contributes to apoptosis in murine CH and that Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis plays a partial role in the development of CH. The contribution of Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis to CH appears independent of Th1 and Th2 cytokines.", null ],

  "texts" : [ "Error Control With Binary Cyclic Codes", "Error-control codes provide a mechanism to increase the reliability of digital data being processed, transmitted, or stored under noisy conditions. Cyclic codes constitute an important class of error-control code, offering powerful error detection and correction capabilities. They can easily be generated and verified in hardware, which makes them particularly well suited to the practical use as error detecting codes.A cyclic code is based on a generator polynomial which determines its properties including the specific error detection strength. The optimal choice of polynomial depends on many factors that may be influenced by the underlying application. It is therefore advantageous to employ programmable cyclic code hardware that allows a flexible choice of polynomial to be applied to different requirements. A novel method is presented in this thesis to realise programmable cyclic code circuits that are fast, energy-efficient and minimise implementation resources.It can be shown that the correction of a single-bit error on the basis of a cyclic code is equivalent to the solution of an instance of the discrete logarithm problem. A new approach is proposed for computing discrete logarithms; this leads to a generic deterministic algorithm for analysed group orders that equal Mersenne numbers with an exponent of a power of two. The algorithm exhibits a worst-case runtime in the order of the square root of the group order and constant space requirements.This thesis establishes new relationships for finite fields that are represented as the polynomial ring over the binary field modulo a primitive polynomial. With a subset of these properties, a novel approach is developed for the solution of the discrete logarithm in the multiplicative groups of these fields. This leads to a deterministic algorithm for small group orders that has linear space and linearithmic time requirements in the degree of defining polynomial, enabling an efficient correction of single-bit errors based on the corresponding cyclic codes.", null ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Efficient Bug Prediction and Fix Suggestions", "Bugs are a well known Achilles' heel of software development. In the last few years, machine learning techniques to combat software bugs have become popular. However, results of these techniques are not good enough for practical adoption. In addition, most techniques do not provide reasons for why a code change is a bug. Furthermore, suggestions to fix the bug would be greatly beneficial. An added bonus would be engaging humans to improve the bug and fix prediction process.In this dissertation, a step-by-step procedure which effectively predicts buggy code changes (Bug Prognosticator), produces bug fix suggestions (Fix Suggester), and utilizes human feedback is presented. Each of these steps can  be used independently, but combining them allows more effective management of bugs. These techniques are tested on many open source and a large commercial project. Human feedback was used to understand and improve the performance of the techniques. Feedback was primarily gathered from industry participants in order to assess practical suitability.The Bug Prognosticator explores feature selection techniques and classifiers to improve results of code change bug prediction. The optimized Bug Prognosticator is able to achieve an average 97% precision and 70% recall when evaluated on eleven projects, ten open source and one commercial.The Fix Suggester uses the Bug Prognosticator and statistical analysis of keyword term frequencies to suggest unordered fix keywords to a code change predicted to be buggy. The suggestions are validated against actual bug fixes to confirm their utility. The Fix Suggester is able to achieve 46.9% precision and 38.9% recall on its predicted fix tokens. This is a reasonable start to the difficult problem of predicting the contents of a bug fix.To improve the efficiency of the Bug Prognosticator and the Fix Suggester, active learning is employed on willing human participants. Developers aid the Bug Prognosticator and the Fix Suggester on code changes that machines find hard to evaluate. The developer's feedback is used to enhance the performance of the Bug Prognosticator and the Fix Suggester. In addition, a user study is performed to gauge the utility of the Fix Suggester.The dissertation concludes with a discussion of future work and challenges faced by the techniques. Given the success of statistical defect prediction techniques, more industrial exposure would benefit researchers and software practitioners.", null ],

  "texts" : [ "The yeast vacuolar membrane proteome", "Transport of solutes between the cytosol and the vacuolar lumen is of crucial importance for various functions of vacuoles, including ion homeostasis; detoxification; storage of different molecules such as amino acids, phosphate, and calcium ions; and proteolysis. To identify proteins that catalyze solute transport across the vacuolar membrane, the membrane proteome of purified Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuoles was analyzed. Subtractive proteomics was used to distinguish contaminants from true vacuolar proteins by comparing the relative abundances of proteins in pure and crude preparations. A robust statistical analysis combining enrichment ranking with the double boundary iterative group analysis revealed that 148 proteins were significantly enriched in the pure vacuolar preparations. Among these proteins were well characterized vacuolar proteins, such as the subunits of the vacuolar H+-ATPase, but also proteins that had not previously been assigned to a cellular location, many of which are likely novel vacuolar membrane transporters, e.g. for nucleosides and oligopeptides. Although the majority of contaminating proteins from other organelles were depleted from the pure vacuolar membranes, some proteins annotated to reside in other cellular locations were enriched along with the vacuolar proteins. In many cases the enrichment of these proteins is biologically relevant, and we discuss that a large group is involved in membrane fusion and protein trafficking to vacuoles and may have multiple localizations. Other proteins are degraded in vacuoles, and in some cases database annotations are likely to be incomplete or incorrect. Our work provides a wealth of information on vacuolar biology and a solid basis for further characterization of vacuolar functions. ?? 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.", null ],

We have developed a code to compute the spectrum of gravitational waves (GWs) based on the widely accepted one-scale model. In its simplest form the one-scale model for cosmic strings allows one to vary: (i) the string tension, G$\\mu$/c2; (ii) the size of cosmic string loops relative to the horizon at birth, $\\alpha$; (iii) the spectral index of the emission spectrum, q; (iv) the cutoff in the emission spectrum, n*; and (v) the intercommutation probability, p. The amplitude and slope of the spectrum in the nHz frequency range is very sensitive to these unknown parameters. We have also investigated the impact of more complicated scenarios with multiple initial loop sizes $\\alpha$, in particular, the 2-$\\alpha$ models proposed in the literature and a log-normal distribution for $\\alpha$. We have computed the constraint on G$\\mu$/c2 due to the limit on a stochastic background of GWs imposed by the European Pulsar Timing Array. Taking into account all the possible uncertainties in the parameters we find a conservative upper limit of G$\\mu$/c2\\&lt;5.3??10-7 which typically occurs when the loop production scale is close to the gravitational backreaction scale, $\\alpha$???$\\Gamma$G$\\mu$/c2. Stronger limits are possible for specific values of the parameters which typically correspond to the extremal cases $\\alpha$???$\\Gamma$G$\\mu$/c2 and $\\alpha$???$\\Gamma$G$\\mu$/c2. This limit is less stringent than the previously published limits which are based on cusp emission, an approach which does not necessarily model all the possible uncertainties. We discuss the prospects for lowering this limit by 2 orders of magnitude, or even a detection of the GW background, in the very near future in the context of the Large European Array for Pulsars and the Square Kilometre Array.", null ],

The focus of the study is to quantify the effect of the gap in the elastic layer on the radiated acoustic power. A finite element method is employed to determine the acoustic pressure field in the fluid and the displacement field in the coupled layer. This reveals that the effect of a modest sized gap in the coating does not markedly alter the radiated field except at distinct frequencies, at which values the coating exhibits strong fluid-coupled oscillations. We develop a simple analytical model to explain the resonance phenomenon and show that quasi-resonances arise when the wavelength of the deformation pattern 'matches' the azimuthal length of the surface of the coating. This resonant behaviour is conveniently captured by a single parameter Q, which is the ratio of the typical inertial fluid pressure induced by the wall oscillation to the stiffness of the elastic coating. For each choice of material parameters, there is shown to be an infinite set of values of Q corresponding to distinct quasi-resonance mode numbers. The effects on the radiated field due to variations in various physical parameters, such as acoustic wavenumber and elastic layer inertia, are also discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

And I show how this observation has significant implications for how we should understand debates about which of these theories is best.\tI focus on three basic conceptions of what we are like as agents: the evaluator, explainer and planning conceptions. I show that three of the leading theories of self-governance are each grounded in a different one of these conceptions and how this affects the debate about which theory is best. This way of looking at the dialectic tells against a common way of arguing against rival views. Arguments that appeal to intuitions about cases in order to generate counterexamples are not apt to be fair or persuasive because they too easily invoke contentious conceptions of what we are like as agents. But it suggests an alternative way to proceed. One can muster a holistic argument in favor of one's preferred basic conception, showing that it can ground independently plausible philosophical theories of various kinds. I suggest how such an argument might go for the evaluator conception, considering its merits as grounds for both a comprehensive theory of human agency and a moral theory.", null ],

  "texts" : [ "Time Courses of Desensitization and Recovery From Adaptation in Mouse Rod Photoreceptors", "Sensitivity and dynamic range are two important characteristics of sensory receptors in the nervous system that define the physiological role of these cells. Rod cells in the retina of a mouse have the ability to detect very dim lights by closing cyclic-gated nucleotide channels. This extreme sensitivity would be impractical if the dynamic range on these cells was limited. Adaptation is a process by which the sensitivity of the transduction cascade is adjusted so cells can function within broader ranges of stimuli. Electrical recordings of circulating currents have been used to show that in the presence of steady background light, rods are desensitized so that saturation doesn't occur, and they remain responsive to increments and decrements of illumination. Furthermore, changes in calcium concentration have been proposed to mediate modulations of various molecules within the transduction pathways. In this project, we investigated the time course of desensitization and recovery in adaptation using suction electrode recording. We were able to show, desensitization at various ranges of adapting light, as manifested by the fact that reduction in sensitivity acceleration of recovery is already present at 500 ms. We also demonstrated that in recovery from adaptation, sensitivity of the rod returns back to its dark-adapted levels within 2 seconds. The persistence of adaptation in the form of acceleration of recovery was present with extremely dim lights and the time constant of its recovery to dark-adapted levels was dependent on the intensity of the background light.", null ],

  "texts" : [ "Biosynthesis and engineering of cyclomarin and cyclomarazine : prenylated, non- ribosomal cyclic peptides of marine actinobacterial origin", "Cyclomarins are potent anti-inflammatory cyclic peptides originally encountered in the estuarine streptomycete, strain CNB-982, and subsequently isolated from the marine obligate actinobacterium Salinispora arenicola CNS-205 along with the truncated antibacterial diketopiperazine cyclomarazines. The cyclomarins are composed of seven amino acid residues, two of which are of unique biosynthetic interest, 2-amino-3,5-dimethylhex-4-enoic acid (ADH), which has never been reported as a constituent of any peptide, and N-(1,1-dimethyl-1-allyl)- tryptophan, which is a rare example of the prenylation of a bacterial non-ribosomal peptide. The N-prenylated tryptophan residue, along with [delta]-hydroxyleucine, is present in both the cyclomarins and cyclomarazines, suggesting a common biosynthetic origin. Because of the unique structural features of ADH and N-(1,1-dimethyl-1-allyl)- tryptophan, along with the extensive tailoring of the remaining residues of cyclomarin, we initiated the interrogation of the biosynthetic machinery behind cyclomarin and cyclomarazine synthesis. We were able to determine the basic steps of cyclomarin and cyclomarazine production, along with insights into how the two unique amino acids are synthesized. Furthermore, we were able to identify the oxidative enzymes involved in tailoring both peptides. Analysis of the genome sequence of S. arenicola CNS-205 revealed the cym biosynthetic gene cluster, which is dominated by cymA, encoding for a seven module non- ribosomal peptide synthetase. Downstream of cymA are the genes for N-(1,1-dimethyl-1-allyl)- tryptophan synthesis via the prenyltransferase CymD, and ADH via cymE-H. CymEF is an aldolase/dehydrogenase pair utilized for the key C-C bond forming step of ADH synthesis, along with a methyltransferase CymG, and a dehydrogenase CymH. Upstream of cymA is the Fe²⁺/[alpha]-ketoglutarate dependent leucine [delta]-oxygenase CymW, and three cytochrome P450s oxidases, CymO, CymS, and CymV. Bioinformatic analysis coupled with in vivo mutagenesis confirmed the role of Cym W along with CymS as a N-(1,1-dimethyl-1-allyl)- tryptophan [beta]-hydroxylase, and CymV as a N-(1,1- dimethyl-2,3-epoxypropyl)-tryptophan epoxidase, and suggested the function of CymO as a phenylalanine [beta]- hydroxylase . In addition to establishing the function of the aforementioned enzymes, we were able to generate the novel N-(1-methyl)-tryptophan and N-(1-propargyl)- tryptophan analogs of both sized peptides in the cymD deficient mutant, confirming the preference for N- alkylated tryptophan residues and the amenability of cyclomarin and cyclomarazine to derivatization via mutasynthesis", null ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Energy deposition in the body from external sources to chemically trigger cellular responses in desired localized regions", "One of the major challenges of modern chemotherapy is to deliver a therapeutic dose of active drug to the tumor tissue without causing systemic exposure. The realization of this goal could considerably reduce the negative side effects experienced by patients. The work conducted in this thesis looks at two different approaches to trigger drug activation with the use of external energy sources. This avoids the challenges of relying solely on biochemical and environmental differences as triggers. The two triggers used were low intensity focused ultrasound and 365 nm light delivered with a custom designed needle UV LED fiber optic system. Both can be localized within the body to spatially highlight just the tumor tissue creating a stark differentiation between it and the healthy tissue. The 365nm light based delivery scheme developed here was the first demonstration of a photoactivatable doxorubicin (DOX) prodrug called DOX-PCB. DOX-PCB was shown to be 200 times less toxic than DOX and could be activated to a fully therapeutic form upon exposure to 365nm light. The pharmacokinetics showed a circulation half life comparable to that of DOX and stability against in vivo metabolic degradation. The 365 nm light was shown to adequately irradiate a centimeter of tumor tissue and cause localized activation. In vivo tumors exposed to the light had significantly higher doses of DOX than unexposed control tumors in the same individual. The second delivery scheme made use of focused ultrasound to activate echogenic drug delivery vehicles. These vehicles were the first demonstration of encapsulating microbubbles within liposomes. Specially designed optical equipment documented that the microbubble was ultrasound responsive. The microbubble was shown to violently cavitate and rupture the outer liposome membrane releasing the payload contents. The three dimensional localization of activation was demonstrated in tissue phantoms. The strengths of these two delivery schemes could complement each other when used together. The delivery vehicle could achieve high doses of DOX-PCB within the tumor while the low toxicity prevents harm to the liver and spleen. The 365 nm light could then activate just the DOX-PCB found within the tumor itself causing localized cell death", null ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "PERIODIC DISTURBANCE REJECTION OF NONLINEAR SYSTEMS", "Disturbance rejection is an important topic in control design since disturbances are inevitable in practical systems. To realise this target for nonlinear systems, this thesis brings in an assumption about the existence of a controlled invariant mani- fold and a Desired Feedforward Control (DFC) which is contained in the input to compensate the influence of disturbances. According to the approximation property of Neural Networks (NN) that any periodic signals defined in a compact set can be approximated by NN, the NN-based disturbance approximator is applied to approximate the DFC. Algorithmically, two important types of NN approximators that are Multi-layer Neural Networks (MNN) and Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNN) are presented in detail.In this thesis, a variety of nonlinear systems in standard canonical form are looked into. These forms are the output feedback form, the extended output feedback form, the decentralised output feedback form and the partial state feedback form. For these systems, four types of uncertainties are mainly considered. The first one is the disturbance that can be eliminated by the DFC. Secondly, the parameter uncertainty is taken into account. To get rid of this uncertainty, the adaptive control technique is employed for the estimation of unknown parameters, e.g. the NN gain matrix. The third one is the nonlinear uncertainty. For the case that nonlinear uncertainties are polynomials, it has a bound consisting of an unknown constant and a function of the regulated error such that this uncertainty can be also treated as the parameter uncertainty. Delay is the last type of uncertainty. Particularly, the delay is supposed to appear in output only. This uncertainty can be eliminated together with the nonlinear uncertainty. To establish the closed- loop stability, a Lyapunov-Krasovskii function is invoked. In addition, due to the requirement of the system structure or the stability analysis, some general control techniques are also involved such like the backstepping control and the high gain control.Throughout the results are illustrated by simulations.", null ],

How these defense mechanisms have shaped the evisceration and regenerative processes of sea cucumber Holothuria leucospilota still remain largely unstudied. In this study it is revealed that Holothuria leucospilota remain very consistent in their modes of evisceration, ejecting the same organs in every evisceration event. The consistency is compounded by the finding that approximately 28% of their body mass is eviscerated regardless of organism size. In terms of organ regeneration, the thickening of the mesentery tissues is apparent at Day 4 and regeneration of the digestive tract at Day 16. Sediment feeding also resumes at Day 16 along with the regeneration of the digestive tract. No regeneration of the left respiratory tree or gonads is observed within the 28-day study. ", null ],

The latter reproduced plasmon energies and general plasmon structure well; however, the detailed shape of the pi-plasmon of the calculated pure BN spectra shows discrepancies with the experimental data.

  "texts" : [ "Patterns of methylation heritability in a genome-wide analysis of four brain regions", "DNA methylation has been implicated in a number of diseases and other phenotypes. It is, therefore, of interest to identify and understand the genetic determinants of methylation and epigenomic variation. We investigated the extent to which genetic variation in cis-DNA sequence explains variation in CpG dinucleotide methylation in publicly available data for four brain regions from unrelated individuals, finding that 3–4% of CpG loci assayed were heritable, with a mean estimated narrow-sense heritability of 30% over the heritable loci. Over all loci, the mean estimated heritability was 3%, as compared with a recent twin-based study reporting 18%. Heritable loci were enriched for open chromatin regions and binding sites of CTCF, an influential regulator of transcription and chromatin architecture. Additionally, heritable loci were proximal to genes enriched in several known pathways, suggesting a possible functional role for these loci. Our estimates of heritability are conservative, and we suspect that the number of identified heritable loci will increase as the methylome is assayed across a broader range of cell types and the density of the tested loci is increased. Finally, we show that the number of heritable loci depends on the window size parameter commonly used to identify candidate cis-acting single-nucleotide polymorphism variants.", null ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Investigating a method of producing \"Red and Dead\" galaxies", "In optical wavelengths, galaxies are observed to be either red or blue. The overall color of a galaxy is due to the distribution of the ages of its stellar population. Galaxies with currently active star formation appear blue, while those with no recent star formation at all (greater than about a Gyr) have only old, red stars. This strong bimodality has lead to the idea of star formation quenching, and various proposed physical mechanisms. In this dissertation, I attempt to reproduce with Enzo the results of Naab et al. (2007), in which red and dead galaxies are formed using gravitational quenching,rather than with one of the more typical methods of quenching. My initial attempts are unsuccessful, and I explore the reasons why I think they failed. Then using simpler methods better suited to Enzo + AMR, I am successful in producing a galaxy that appears to be similar in color and formation history to those in Naab et al. However, quenching is achieved using unphysically high star formation efficiencies, which is a different mechanism than Naab et al. suggests. Preliminary results of a much higher resolution, follow-on simulation of the above show some possible contradiction with the results of Naab et al. Cold gas is streaming into the galaxy to fuel starbursts, while at a similar epoch the galaxies in Naab et al. have largely already ceased forming stars in the galaxy. On the other hand, the results of the high resolution simulation are qualitatively similar to other works in the literature that show a somewhat different gravitational quenching mechanism than Naab et al. I also discuss my work using halo finders to analyze simulated cosmological data, and my work improving the Enzo/AMR analysis tool \"yt\". This includes two parallelizations of the halo finder HOP which allows analysis of very large cosmological datasets on parallel machines. The first version is \"yt-HOP,\" which works well for datasets between about 256³ and 512³ particles, but has memory bottlenecks as the datasets get larger. These bottlenecks inspired the second version, \"Parallel HOP,\" which is a fully parallelized method and implementation of HOP that has worked on datasets with more than 2048³ particles on hundreds of processing cores. Both methods are described in detail, as are the various effects of performance- related runtime options. Additionally, both halo finders are subjected to a full suite of performance benchmarks varying both dataset sizes and computational resources used. I conclude with descriptions of four new tools I added to yt. A Parallel Structure Function Generator allows analysis of two-point functions, such as correlation functions, using memory- and workload- parallelism. A Parallel Merger Tree Generator leverages the parallel halo finders in yt, such as Parallel HOP, to build the merger tree of halos in a cosmological simulation, and outputs the result to a SQLite database for simple and powerful data extraction. A Star Particle Analysis toolkit takes a group of star particles and can output the rate of formation as a function of time, and/or a synthetic Spectral Energy Distribution (S.E.D.) using the Bruzual and Charlot (2003) data tables. Finally, a Halo Mass Function toolkit takes as input a list of halo masses and can output the halo mass function for the halos, as well as an analytical fit for those halos using several previously published fits", null ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Record of seamount production and off-axis evolution in the western North Atlantic Ocean, 25°25′–27°10′N", "Using multibeam bathymetry, we identified 86 axial and 1290 off-axis seamounts (near-circular volcanoes with heights ≥70 m) in an area of 75,000 km2 on the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR), 25°25′N to 27°10′N, extending ∼400 km from the inner rift valley floor to ∼29 Ma crust. Our study shows that seamounts are a common morphological feature of the North Atlantic seafloor. Seamount-producing volcanism occurs primarily on the inner rift valley floor, and few, if any, seamounts are formed on the rift valley walls or the ridge flank. The high abundance of off-axis seamounts is consistent with 1–3 km wide sections of oceanic crust being transferred intact from the axial valley to the ridge flank on crust >4 Ma. Significant changes in seamount abundances, sizes, and shapes are attributed to the effects of faulting between ∼0.6 and 2 m.y. off axis in the lower rift valley walls. Few seamounts are completely destroyed by (inward facing) faults, and population abundances are similar to those on axis. However, faulting reduces the characteristic height of the seamount population significantly. In the upper portions of the rift valley, on 2–4 Ma crust, crustal aging processes (sedimentation and mass wasting), together with additional outward facing faults, destroy and degrade a significant number of seamounts. Beyond the crest of the rift mountains (>4 Ma crust) faulting is no longer active, and changes in the off-axis seamount population reflect crustal aging processes as well as temporal changes in seamount production that occurred at the ridge axis. Estimates of population density for off-axis seamounts show a positive correlation to crustal thickness inferred from analysis of gravity data, suggesting that increased seamount production accompanies increased magma input at the ridge axis. We find no systematic variations in seamount population density along isochron within individual ridge segments. Possible explanations are that along-axis production of seamounts is uniform or that seamount production is enhanced in some regions (e.g., segment centers), but many seamounts do not meet our counting criteria because they are masked by younger volcanic eruptions and low-relief flows.Author Posting. © American Geophysical Union, 2000.

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Friction Joining of Aluminium-to-Magnesium for Lightweight Automotive Applications", "Friction joining techniques, such as Friction Stir Spot Welding (FSSW) and high power Ultrasonic Welding (USW), could offer a solution for joining dissimilar materials combinations, such as aluminium (Al) to magnesium (Mg), where high intermetallic reaction rates make the use of conventional joining techniques problematic. Ultrasonic welds have been produced between 1 mm gauge Al 6111-T4 and Mg AZ31-H24 sheets, and the interfacial reaction has been studied as a function of welding time. For this welding system, the mechanical properties of the joints were optimised when a double reed welding system was employed to join materials that had been prepared using 800 grit SiC paper under a clamping force of 1.9 kN, and when the materials were oriented with the rolling direction parallel to the vibration direction. Welds produced between Al and Mg achieved similar peak lap shear strengths to those produced between Mg and Mg at welding times of 0.4 s, but the failure energy of the Al-Mg welds was less than half that of the parent material. In addition, the Al-Mg welds always failed at the interface between the sheets, rather than the desirable, and more energy intensive, pullout mechanism. The inferior mechanical properties were attributed to the rapid formation of a brittle intermetallic layer that initially formed as islands of the γ-Al12Mg17 phase. These islands rapidly spread and became continuous within 0.3 s of welding time, at which point a second sublayer of the β-Al3Mg2 phase began to form on the Al side of the intermetallic reaction layer. The combined layers reached a total thickness of 20 µm within 0.9 s of welding time, with the β-Al3Mg2 sublayer becoming the thicker of the two by this point. At longer welding times, interface liquation was observed at temperatures below the recognised lowest temperature eutectic reaction in the Al-Mg binary phase diagram. This was the result of the alloying elements present in the system and there was no depression in the melting point as a result of the high strain rate associated with this process, as has been proposed elsewhere. The rate of growth of the intermetallic layer during welding was higher than in static heat treatments, which was most likely due to the deformation causing microcracking in the brittle intermetallic layer, allowing short circuit diffusion to occur, and enhancing the growth rate by a factor of approximately 2. Finally, attempts were made to limit the rate of intermetallic compound (IMC) formation by applying coatings to the Mg sheet. The effect of the coatings was to reduce the overall IMC layer thickness by 50 %.", null ],

  "texts" : [ "Characterization of the ER stress checkpoint in mammalian cells", "Progression through the cell cycle adapts to both internal and environmental stimuli to ensure fidelity of cell division. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress arising from an imbalance between cellular demand for protein folding and ER capacity has been described to cause G1 cell cycle arrest. The molecular components of this ER stress checkpoint have just begun to be uncovered. Although evidence emerge to suggest a prosurvival role for the ER stress-induced cell cycle arrest, the functional significance of this checkpoint in mammalian cells largely remains as an open question. Given the implication of ER stress in multiple human diseases like cancer and neurological disorders, elucidation of the link between ER stress and cell cycle may provide new insights to the pathogenesis and treatment of these diseases. In Chapter 1, I introduce the principles of cell cycle regulation and checkpoint responses, leading to a discussion on the discoveries that support an emerging ER stress checkpoint in eukaryotic cells. In Chapter 2, I investigate the mechanisms underlying cell cycle delay in G1 in response to ER stress in mammalian cells, showing that ER stress reduces the protein expression of Skp2 by downregulating Ufd1, a protein that stabilizes Skp2 through its ability to recruit the deubiquitinating enzyme USP13. This results in an accumulation of p27 that partly contributes to G1 arrest in ER-stressed cells. In Chapter 3, I identify another regulator of the ER stress checkpoint, APC/C-Cdh1, and begin to examine the upstream signals responsible for activating APC/C-Cdh1 under ER stress conditions. In Chapter 4, I provide a summary of the work and discuss the implications of my findings", null ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "An Evaluation of the Importance of Hand Exposures Using Rubber Latex Gloves as Sampling Dosimeters for Assessing Pesticide Exposures in Strawberry Harvesters", "The widespread use of pesticides in California is commonly viewed as a significant public health concern.  Exposure is particularly a concern for workers who use pesticides in agriculture or who are exposed to them during the harvesting of fruits and vegetables.   Previous research has shown that direct dermal and clothing contact with foliar residues is primarily responsible for pesticide exposures among harvesters. These exposures occur primarily due to hand contact with treated leaf surfaces while picking the fruit. The overall objective of our research was to conduct detailed, systematic evaluations of strawberry harvester exposures for periods extending up to 3 weeks after the application of malathion, an organophosphate insecticide, and fenpropathrin, a pyrethroid insecticide. Since exposure occurs primarily through the workers' hands, we decided to also investigate the effectiveness of rubber latex gloves as sampling dosimeters to measure the transfer and dissipation of malathion and fenpropathrin. During the first phase of our studies, we conducted controlled field studies on turf using rubber latex gloves to define the factors that could influence the transfer of pesticides to the glove and that would affect their use as a residue monitoring device. We developed a novel sampling device called the Brinkman Contact Transfer Unit (BCTU) to study the glove characteristics and residue transfer and accumulation under controlled conditions on turf. A validation of the use of rubber latex gloves as a residue sampling dosimeter was performed by comparing pesticide transfer and dissipation from the gloves with the transferable turf residues sampled using the validated California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) roller, a standard measure of residue transfer. The observed correlation between the two methods were 0.93 for malathion and 0.87 for fenpropathrin, indicating that the BCTU is a useful surrogate tool for studying available residue transfer to rubber latex gloves under experimental conditions. In the second phase of our studies, we investigated the transfer of pesticide residues from foliage to strawberry harvesters under normal work conditions in the field.  In addition, foliar residue dissipation from the leaves and gloves was measured using five independent sampling methods. Malathion and fenpropathrin residues, sampled by measuring dislodgeable foliar residues or the transfer of foliar residues to cotton cloth dosimeters,  decayed by 90% within 7 days after pesticide application. When harvesters picking fruit wore rubber latex gloves for food safety and hygiene reasons, the gloves accumulated pesticide residues.  Within 7 days, the recovery of residues on the gloves decreased by 75%. Though this decline is slightly slower than that seen with the foliar residues, both reached low stable levels. Quantitative measurements of end-of-shift harvester hand washes and 16 hour harvester urine samples were also collected from barehanded and gloved harvesters to study hand exposures and internal exposures as absorbed daily dosages, respectively. Hand wash residue levels decayed by 90%, within 7 days after pesticide application, and less than 2% of measured residues penetrated the latex gloves to reach the harvester hands. Based on these measures, the gloved harvesters had 45% lower internal exposure than the barehanded harvesters, demonstrating that rubber latex gloves are a protective barrier to surface residues. Overall, the absorbed daily doses of malathion for barehanded and gloved harvesters were lower than 0.005 mg/kg-day. However, the decline in excreted urine metabolites were only 43% in gloved harvesters and 33% in barehanded harvesters, which was slower and more prolonged than expected based on our observations from other sampling techniques.  Our results indicate that there were likely other sources of exposure such as malathion breakdown products present on the foliar surfaces after the dissipation of malathion itself. This is consistent with recent studies that have shown that malathion degradation products are present for prolonged periods on foliar surfaces. Overall, our studies demonstrate that latex gloves can be useful as dosimeters of pesticide residues and show that malathion and fenpropathrin themselves dissipate relatively quickly from strawberry fields.", null ],

We then classify the probability functions that satisfy AP (in the presence of some other widely accepted principles of rationality) for  languages with at most four mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive outcomes (as in the Wheel of Fortune case) and show that there are no solutions to AP for larger languages. In light of this, we conclude by suggesting a modification of the principle and noting that it remains an open problem to provide the full classification of probability functions that satisfy it.", null ],

In addition, our simulationsallow us to investigate the sensitivity of our results to numericalresolution and to sub-grid baryonic physics (especially feedback fromsupernovae and active galactic nuclei). We find that the mostsignificant uncertainty in modelling the neutral hydrogen distributionarises from our need to model a self-shielding correction in moderatedensity regions. Future simulations incorporating radiative transferschemes will be vital to improve on our empirical self-shieldingthreshold. Irrespective of the exact nature of the threshold, we findthat while the atomic hydrogen mass function evolves only mildly fromredshift two to zero, the molecular hydrogen mass function increaseswith increasing redshift, especially at the high-mass end.Interestingly, the weak evolution of the neutral hydrogen mass functionis insensitive to the feedback scheme utilized, but the opposite is truefor the molecular gas, which is more closely associated with the starformation in the simulations.", null ],

This provides a specific, high-throughput assay which accurately measures culture media glucose concentrations between 7 and 30 mM, without spectral interferences by phenol red or sera. Use of this assay revealed that the concentration of glucose in BeWo cell cultures remains stable for 48 h. In contrast placental explants rapidly consume glucose thus the concentration in culture media significantly decreases over 12 h necessitating more frequent replenishment in order to maintain the desired concentration.

Interestingly, we lack information about their involvement in human sebaceous gland biology. Therefore, in this current study, we investigated the functions of the PKC system in human immortalized SZ95 sebocytes. Using molecular biological approaches, imaging, and functional assays, we report that SZ95 sebocytes express the conventional cPKCα; the novel nPKCδ, ɛ, and η; and the atypical aPKCζ. Activation of the PKC system by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulated lipid synthesis (a hallmark of differentiation) and resulted in translocation and then downregulation of cPKCα and nPKCδ. In good accord with these findings, the effect of PMA was effectively abrogated by inhibitors and short interfering RNA-mediated \"silencing\" of cPKCα and nPKCδ. Of further importance, molecular or pharmacological inhibition of nPKCδ also prevented the lipogenic and apoptosis-promoting action of arachidonic acid. Finally, we also found that \"knockdown\" of the endogenous aPKCζ activity markedly increased basal lipid synthesis and apoptosis, suggesting its constitutive activity in suppressing these processes. Collectively, our findings strongly argue for the fact that certain PKCs have pivotal, isoform-specific, differential, and antagonistic roles in the regulation of human sebaceous gland-derived sebocyte biology.", null ],

During this differentiation process, the preadipocytes remodel the extracellular matrix by releasing new extracellular proteins. Finally, we investigated the viability of the new basement membrane as a scaffold for tissue engineering using human pancreatic islets, and as a scaffold for soft tissue repair. After identifying the original scaffold material, we sought to improve the yield of material, treating the cell as a bioreactor, through various nutritional and cytokine stimuli.

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Gene Regulation in M Cell Lineages: In Vitro and In Vivo", "M cells are specialized epithelial cells, which assist immune surveillance by transcytosis of particles and antigens to underlying lymphoid tissues. So far, three M cell phenotypes have been identified in airways and intestines. However, the mechanism of M cell differentiation is poorly understood, as well as the relationships between different M cell subtypes. To better understand these questions, we treated human (Caco-2BBe) and rodent (IEC-6) intestinal epithelial cell lines with lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and TNF receptor (TNFR) agonists. Treated cells were then studied for regulation of genes previously shown to associate with M cell and Follicle-Associated Epithelium (FAE).  Moreover, we used a reporter transgenic mouse strain to follow the development of M cell subsets in vivo, and examined the de novo induction of M cells by cholera toxin (CT).We found that LTbetaR and TNFR agonists can induce transcription of FAE specific genes (Ccl20 and Lamb3) as well as rodent M cell specific genes such as Sgne-1/Scg5, Cldn4, and Gp2 in Caco2-BBe cells and IEC-6 cells. These cytokines have distinct but complementary effects; TNFR agonists induced FAE specific genes, while the LTbetaR agonist induces M cell specific genes. The combination of these cytokines showed additive induction of the FAE-associated Ccl20, Lamb3 and a surprisingly the induction of CD137/Tnfrsf9. Functionally, cytokine treatment led to both the reorganization of microvilli as well as Claudin-4 redistribution. Moreover, with the help of the reporter transgenic mouse model, we have found that M cells overlying intestinal Peyer's patches (PP) and Nasal Associated Lymphoid Tissue (NALT) have distinct developmental origins, yet show convergent phenotypes, such as expression of a PGRP-S reporter in vivo. By contrast, though PP and Villous M cells are derived from intestinal crypt stem cells, their phenotypes are clearly distinct. Thus, PP M cells form an intimate M cell-dendritic cell functional unit while Villous M cells do not engage with underlying DC. Though B lymphocytes are thought to play a critical role in M cell function by forming a basolateral pocket and possibly signaling through CD137, initial commitment to M cell lineages is B lymphocyte and CD137 independent. In addition, CT can causes rapid induction of new M cells in the airway and intestines without cell division, suggesting transdifferentiation from mature epithelial cells. CT-induced M cells show the local M cell phenotype without evidence for mixed phenotypes. Finally, M cell phenotypes display distinct capabilities; thus, intestinal PP M cells were more efficient than Villous M cells in the uptake of Salmonella. Our studies show that LTbetaR and TNFR agonists induce many features associated with M cell differentiation, and suggest that these agonists may be involved in secondary lymphoid tissue development in vivo. Additionally, we confirmed that the differentiation of M cells in vivo toward strictly defined phenotypic subsets, and is consistent with functional specialization.", null ],

Regression analysis was performed to examine the association between gSG6-P1 and MSP-119 seroprevalence and parasite prevalence.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tResult\n\t\t\t\t\tSeroprevalence of gSG6-P1 in the uphill population was 36% while it was 50% valley bottom (&#967;2&#8201;=&#8201;13.2, df&#8201;=&#8201;1, p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001). Median gSG6-P1 antibody levels in the Valley bottom were twice as high as that observed in the uphill population [4.50 vs. 2.05, p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001] and showed seasonal variation. The odds of gSG6-P1 seropositives having MSP-119 antibodies were almost three times higher than the odds of seronegatives (OR&#8201;=&#8201;2.87, 95% CI [1.977, 4.176]). The observed parasite prevalence for Kisii, Kakamega and Kombewa were 4%, 19.7% and 44.6% whilst the equivalent gSG6-P1 seroprevalence were 28%, 34% and 54%, respectively.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConclusion\n\t\t\t\t\tThe seroprevalence of IgG to gSG6-P1 was sensitive and robust in distinguishing between hypo, meso and hyper transmission settings and seasonal fluctuations.", null ],

  "texts" : [ "Odor representations in olfactory cortex", "Events in our external world are transformed into internal percepts and experiences. How can we begin to understand this transformation? It starts with the stimulation of peripheral sensory organs and ultimately requires the holistic synthesis of ensemble neural activity in the cortex. The cortex is composed of circuits connecting diverse types of neurons across various functional brain regions. In order to fully understand the cortical representation of an external stimulus, we must dissect out basic components of the circuit and characterize their stimulus response properties. We study neural circuits in primary olfactory (piriform) cortex of rodents using electrophysiological recordings in brain slices and < italic>in vivo</italic>. We examine the underlying synaptic mechanisms of odor representations, and how it can be modulated. First, we demonstrate an early developmental critical period for plasticity and structural changes in principal neurons of the olfactory cortex in response to sensory afferent activity. Next, we use in vivo recordings to demonstrate that synaptic inhibition is widely recruited by odor stimuli, whereas synaptic excitation is more selective in principal neurons. We show that the recruitment of both local interneurons as well as intracortical excitatory connections serve to shape odor-evoked synaptic activity. Synchronous beta (15-30 Hz) oscillations between the olfactory cortex and bulb are thought to be important for odor discrimination. We find that odor-evoked synaptic currents in principle cells of olfactory cortex are couple to beta frequency oscillations in the local field potential. A time window between oscillatory synaptic excitation and inhibition restricts the spike timing of odor-evoked spikes. Beta frequency oscillations have been shown to require a centrifugal feedback loop from olfactory cortex back to the bulb. We use an optogenetic approach to reveal that cortical feedback projections provide inhibition onto mitral cells in the olfactory bulb via activation of granule cells. This work establishes a framework to understand basic components of odor representations in olfactory cortex, and a role for cortico-bulbar feedback loop. In combination with work done in the visual, auditory, somatosensory and gustatory cortices, this study contributes to a more complete understanding of sensory information processing by cortical circuits", null ],

However, how the integration of activating and inhibitory signals relates to formation of the NK cell immune synapse remains a central question in our understanding of NK cell recognition. Here we report that ligation of LFA-1 on NK cells induced asymmetrical cell spreading and migration. In contrast, ligation of the activating receptor NKG2D induced symmetrical spreading of ruffled lamellipodia encompassing a dynamic ring of f-actin, concurrent with polarization towards a target cell and a \"stop\" signal. Ligation of both LFA-1 and NKG2D together resulted in symmetrical spreading but co-ligation of inhibitory receptors reverted NK cells to an asymmetrical migratory configuration leading to inhibitory synapses being smaller and more rapidly disassembled. Using micropatterned activating and inhibitory ligands, signals were found to be continuously and locally integrated during spreading. Together, these data demonstrate that NK cells spread to form large, stable, symmetrical synapses if activating signals dominate, whereas asymmetrical migratory \"kinapses\" are favoured if inhibitory signals dominate. This clarifies how the integration of activating and inhibitory receptor signals is translated to an appropriate NK cell response.", null ],

We modeled the three-dimensional structure of human 17??-HSD7, analyzed the phylogeny of 17??-HSD7 homologues and determined its expression pattern by in silico Northern blotting. Predominant expression is found not only in reproductive tissues (breast, ovary, placenta) but also in liver and developing brain, principal sites of cholesterol synthesis. The substrate binding pocket is opening towards a conserved membrane-associated helix, which is indicative for a conversion of a membrane component. 17??-HSD7 shows significant homology to a yeast 3-ketosteroid reductase (ERG27) involved in ergosterol biosynthesis. Our results lead to the conclusion that 17??-HSD7 is not only involved in estradiol production but plays another (and possibly more important) role as a 3-ketosteroid reductase in cholesterogenesis. This agrees with the striking absence of 17??-HSD7 homologues in the complete genomes of Drosophila and C. elegans which are both auxotrophic for cholesterol.

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "A Model of Spacetime Emergence in the Early Universe", "This thesis proposes and develops much of the groundwork for a model of emergent physics, posited to describe the initial condition and early evolution of a universe.  Two different considerations motivate the model.  First, the spacetime manifold underlying general relativity and quantum theory is a complex object with much structure, but its origin is unexplained by the standard picture.  Second, it is argued, the usual assumption of the preexistence of this manifold leads to possibly intractable theoretical (not observational) difficulties with the usual cosmological inflation idea.  Consistent with both considerations, the assumption of a manifold that precedes a big bang cosmology is dropped; instead, a spacetime manifold with metric, Lorentz symmetry, and manifestation of standard quantum fields propagating on the spacetime all emerge in the model from a simpler, statistically scale invariant underlying structure, driven by an inflation-like process.    The basic structural components of the model are a stochastic (not quantum or classical) scalar field on a general metric space, plus a collection of quantum fields that supply the matter content once spacetime begins to emerge.  Importantly, standard quantum fields cannot be defined on the pre-emergent space; this is addressed by assuming quantum theory exists a priori, and then postulating that quantum fields can begin to manifest once an approximate spacetime has emerged.  Atypical fluctuations in the scalar field transiently break the statistical scale invariance in a localized region of the general metric space; a very small subset have field configurations of approximate spacetimes which can potentially evolve into an initial condition for a universe.  Spacetime structure and geometry then arise from the dependence of propagation speeds and spatial/temporal distances on variations in the scalar field; these variations are seeded by the matter (quantum) fields.  The thesis develops the mathematics of the basic components of the model in some detail, outlines a mechanism whereby scale invariance is broken and dimensionality is fixed, and develops processes and scenarios wherein variations in the scalar field can lead to spacetime geometry in an inflation-like process.  The resulting picture of spacetime is then compared with that of general relativity.", null ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Structural and functional analysis of chemokine interactions with glycosaminoglycans and chemokine receptors", "Chemokines are involved in cell migration and activation during routine immune surveillance, inflammation and even cancer metastasis. The migration of chemokine receptor- bearing cells, including leukocytes and tumor cells, occurs in response to the secretion of chemokines, which accumulate on cell surfaces through interaction with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) where they effectively serve as traffic signals to guide cell movement. Engagement of chemokines with their receptors subsequently causes the activation of signaling pathways that result in firm adhesion and extravasation of the cell into tissue, and in the case of leukocytes, activation of defense mechanisms. However, in cancer cells, the signaling pathways can be exploited or redirected, resulting in responses like survival, growth and proliferation. Herein, a structural and functional approach was used to address specific questions about the interactions of chemokines (i) with GAGs and (ii) with chemokine receptors in the context of cancer. Technically, the use of mass spectrometry has been a strong theme throughout these studies. In Chapter 2, a novel application of hydroxyl radical footprinting coupled with mass spectrometry was used to characterize the GAG binding specificity of the chemokine, MCP-3/CCL7. Potential GAG binding epitopes, identified by mass spectrometry, were then validated by mutagenesis and functional assays. In Chapter 3 and 4, a phosphoproteomic mass spectrometry strategy was used to elucidate CXCL12- mediated survival signaling through the receptor, CXCR4, in cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). While signaling cascades involved in chemokine- mediated migration are well established, pathways involved in cell survival and proliferation in cancer, are not. Methods developed for phosphopeptide enrichment, and subsequent analysis via mass spectrometry are described in Chapter 3, and interesting/novel phosphoproteins, potentially involved in CXCL12-mediated CLL survival are described in Chapter 4. In Chapter 5, a functional approach was taken to elucidate the roles of receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7 in breast cancer growth and metastasis. The data show that CXCR7 affects the functional activity of CXCR4 in vitro, and decreases the extent of lung metastases in vivo, without inhibiting primary tumor growth. Overall, these studies serve to better understand some of the regulatory mechanisms that control chemokine function in normal physiology and in cancer", null ],

Data from controls, mild cognitive impairment patients, and patients with Alzheimer's disease were analyzed using various kinetic models including plasma input, the simplified reference tissue model (RPM) and RPM with vascular correction (RPMVb). In all subject groups, SVCA-based reference tissue curves showed lower blood volume fractions (Vb) and volume of distributions than those based on cerebellum time-activity curve. Probably resulting from the presence of specific signal from the vessel walls that contains in normal condition a significant concentration of the 18 kDa translocation protein. Best contrast between subject groups was seen using SVCA4-based reference tissues as the result of a lower number of kinetic classes and the prior removal of extracerebral tissues. In addition, incorporation of Vb in RPM improved both parametric images and binding potential contrast between groups.

Here the hypothesis was tested that similar patterns could be found in the scalp EEG human subjects trained to discriminate simultaneous visual-auditory CS. Signals were continuously recorded from 64 equispaced scalp electrodes and band-pass filtered. The Hilbert transform gave the analytic phase, which segmented the EEG into temporal frames, and the ana- lytic amplitude, which expressed the pattern in each frame as a feature vector. Methods applied to the ECoG were adapted to the EEG for systematic search of the beta–gamma spectrum, the time period after CS onset, and the scalp surface to locate patterns that could be classified with respect to type of CS. Spatial patterns of EEG amplitude modulation were found from all subjects that could be classified with respect to stimulus combination type significantly above chance levels. The patterns were found in the beta range (15–22 Hz) but not in the gamma range. They occurred in three short bursts following CS onset. They were non-local, occupying the entire array. Our results suggest that the scalp EEG can yield information about the timing of episodically synchronized brain activity in higher cognitive function, so that future studies in brain–computer interfacing can be better focused. Our methods may be most valuable for analyzing data from dense arrays with very high spatial and temporal sampling rates. ", null ],

To study this issue, two unique 1-g soil-pile tests were conducted. The models were constructed in a laminar soil box which was subsequently placed on a uniaxial shake table. One experiment focused on characterizing the soil resistance of partially liquefied soil, while the other on multi-layered soil and the effect of its movement and load demands on the nonlinear behavior of piles. These two different experimental configurations illustrate scenarios commonly observed in the field, where the behavior of the soil and the pile merit further investigation. While evidence in the literature indicates that the lateral soil (\"p-y\") resistance of piles in liquefiable soils is significantly reduced, the shape and amplitude of the reduced p-y curve during pore pressure build-up is not well understood. To investigate this, a single steel pile embedded in homogeneous saturated Nevada sand was subjected to sequential dynamic shaking and lateral inertial equivalent loading. A key goal in the test program was to develop a data set capable of rendering insight into the characteristics of p-y resistance under developing and partial liquefied soil conditions. Test data were used to back-calculate p-y resistance curves for partially liquefied soils. These curves are subsequently adopted in a numerical study of the behavior of piles in partially liquefied soils considering different layering conditions. In contrast, in a multi-layered soil profile, if a loose layer liquefies, large localized plastic demands may be generated in the piles. In the case of concrete piles, these demands manifest flexural cracks in the concrete, which weakens the pile and exposes it to subsequent environmental degradation. During the experiments conducted herein to study this issue, plastic demands in the pile were characterized using curvature profiles coupled with back-calculation of the plastic hinge length and post-test physical observations. Numerical modeling studies demonstrate the applicability of current design- oriented tools to capture these key response parameters needed for design", null ],

  "texts" : [ "Development of FRET-based Technologies for Dynamic and Quantitative Measurement of Protein-protein Interactions and High-throughput Screening of Small Chemical Inhibitors of the SUMO Pathway", "SUMOylation is an important post-translational protein modification mechanism which plays important roles in a variety of biological processes. Conjugation and deconjugation of SUMO is a cascade event requiring multiple protein-protein interactions between SUMO, SUMO E1-E3 enzymes and SUMO substrates. The nature of the SUMOylation network indicates a great potential for small chemical inhibitors to be used in the investigation and manipulation of this important pathway. FRET is an energy transfer phenomenon which occurs between two spectrum-overlapping fluorophores in close proximity. The efficiency of FRET is highly dependent on the distance between the donor and acceptor fluorophores, which makes FRET very powerful in the detection of molecular interactions. The goal of my research is to develop FRET-based techniques to study protein-protein interactions in the SUMOylation network and to identify bioactive chemical compounds which can inhibit the activity of this pathway. Using engineered fluorescent proteins to modify protein components involved in the SUMOylation pathway, I set up a FRET-based assay and developed mathematical algorithms to determine the binding affinity of non-covalent protein-protein interactions. I then developed this FRET-based assay into high-throughput screening platforms to look for small chemical inhibitors which can disrupt the interaction of SUMO1 and its E2 enzyme, Ubc9. I further used FRET-based strategy to set up a whole-pathway screening assay to identify SUMOylation/deSUMOylation inhibitors. Over 200,000 compounds were screened and the positive hits were characterized for their activities in vitro and in cells. Finally, I was able to use FRET to detect the formation of intermediate protein complex during SUMOylation reactions, and used the assay to map the targets of the SUMOylation inhibitors identified from the high-throughput screening. These FRET-based applications provide powerful tools for the study of the SUMOylation pathway and can be used in the investigation of protein-protein interactions in other biological pathways.", null ],

The S. viridochromogenes bar gene was cloned on overlapping restriction fragments using pIJ680 and pIJ702 in the bialaphos-sensitive host, S. lividans. Although the restriction endonuclease cleavage map of these fragments was not similar to the bap cluster of S. hygroscopicus, the presence and location of bar and four other bap genes as well as a gene required for the transcriptional activation of the cluster (brpA) was demonstrated by heterologous cloning experiments using a series of previously characterized bialaphos-nonproducing S. hygroscopicus mutants. Since recombination-deficient mutants of streptomycetes have not been isolated, restored function provided by cloned homologous DNA results from both recombination (marker rescue) and complementation in trans. In contrast to our previously reported homologous cloning experiments where we were able to define the position of mutant alleles by recombination, in these heterologous cloning experiments we observed little if any recombination between plasmid-cloned genes and the chromosome. As a result, this approach allowed us to define the location and orientation of functional genes using a genetic complementation test. The organization of the clustered S. viridochromogenes bap genes was indistinguishable from the corresponding S. hygroscopicus mutant alleles. The fact that the S. viridochromogenes transcriptional regulatory gene, brpA, functioned in S. hygroscopicus implied that some transcriptional regulatory signals may also be interchangeable. In these two Streptomyces species, which have considerable nucleotide sequence divergence, the complex biochemical and genetic organization of the bialaphos biosynthetic pathway is conserved.", null ],

Discovery of death stimuli, death receptors, and downstream signals in the mechanisms for apoptosis has provided information for the design of treatment strategies for various cancers. The cell line used for this study, S49, is a murine lymphoma derived from immature T lymphocytes. Studies of apoptosis in S49 lymphona cells, in particular in response to increases in glucocorticoid and the second messenger cAMP, may serve as a basis for the design of drugs for the treatment of lymphoma or leukemia cancer patients. The focus of efforts in this thesis was on the protein Bim, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl family, which initiates downstream signals that lead to cell death. My studies involved the use of double transgenic rtTA/tetO-Bim S49 cell lines to conditionally express Bim with doxycycline treatment. The results show that increased expression of Bim in response to doxycycline is sufficient to trigger S49 cell apoptosis. In addition, studies conducted with S49 cells with plasmid insert that produces Bim short hairpin RNAs show that Bim is necessary for cAMP/PKA- and glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. Thus, expression of Bim appears to be necessary and sufficient to induce apoptosis in S49 cells, and the PKA and glucocorticoid pathways converged upstream or at the point of induction in Bim expression. The results thus define the mechanism for the killing of S49 cells by cAMP/PKA and glucocorticoids", null ],

Multiple linear regression analyses were used to identify WML volume effects on frontal cortical volume. Structural equation modeling was used to determine the MRI-depression and the MRI-cognition path relationships.ResultsWML predicted frontal cortical volume, particularly in medial orbirtofrontal cortex, irrespective of age, gender, education, and group status. WML directly predicted depressive score, and this relationship was not mediated by regional frontal cortices.

These receptors mediate diverse biological responses, including developmental, physiological, and pathophysiological effects. The embryonic nervous system is a major site of LPA presence and action through its receptors, although the precise cellular and mechanistic roles are not well understood. To study the role of LPA signaling in an intact developing cortex, I developed an in utero injection paradigm targeting mouse brain and used histology and immunochemistry in combination with pharmacological perturbation and LPA receptor null mutants to study this system. Overactivation of LPA₁ via a single LPA bolus exposure causes disruption of neuroprogenitor cells (NPCs) residing in the ventricular zone of the fetal brain, numerous accompanying histological changes - including ventricular dilation, formation of neurorosettes and heterotopias, mitotic displacement, loss of ependymal cells, ciliary defects, and 3rd ventricular occlusion - and subsequently fetal hydrocephalus (FH). In addition, exposure to blood derivatives and components such as serum and plasma through hemorrhage, two major sources of LPA, also cause FH. This modeled disorder can be prevented using both LPA₁ null mutants and pharmacological antagonism. This novel role of LPA in the etiology of FH is consistent with multiple, independent hydrocephalic models and clinical observations, suggesting common mechanistic pathways and, importantly, potential therapeutic targets for the amelioration of this disorder", null ],

The\nshort periods of surface swell sharply limit the thickness of the wave boundary layer,\nconfining it to a thin region below an oscillatory, but essentially irrotational, core. For\na wide range of shelf conditions, the vertical extent of the wave boundary layer does\nnot exceed 2.5 cm and is commonly less. The extreme narrowness of this boundary\nlayer is responsible for high levels of bottom stress and turbulent dissipation. Even in\nrelatively mild sea states, the wave induced bottom shear stress can be sufficient to\ninitiate sediment motion. The wave bottom boundary layer plays an important role\nin the processes of sediment entrainment and transport on the continental margins.\nThis thesis documents the development, testing, and field use of a new instrument,\nthe BASS Rake, designed to measure velocity profiles in the wave boundary layer.\nThe mechanical design supports multiple measurement levels with millimeter vertical\nspacing. The mechanical design is integrated with an electronic interface designed to\npermit flexible acquisition of a suite of horizontal and vertical velocity measurements\nwithout sacrificing the electronic characteristics necessary for high measurement accuracy. The effects of velocity averaging over the sample volume are calculated with\na model of acoustic propagation in a scattering medium appropriate to the scales of\na single differential travel time axis. A simpler parametric model of the averaging\nprocess is then developed and used to specify the transducer characteristics necessary\nto image the wave boundary layer on the continental shelf.\nA flow distortion model for the sensor head is developed and the empirical determinations\nof the Reynolds number, Keulegan-Carpenter number, and angular dependencies\nof the sensor response for the laboratory and field prototypes is presented.\nThe calibrated sensor response of the laboratory prototype is tested against concurrent\nLDV measurements over a natural sand bed in a flume. The single measurement\naccuracy of the BASS Rake is higher than that of the LDV and the multiple sample volumes confer other advantages. For example, the ability of the BASS Rake to image\nvertically coherent turbulent instabilities, invisible to the LDV, is demonstrated.\nSelected data from a twenty-four day field deployment outside the surf zone of a local\nbeach are presented and analyzed. The data reveal regular reworking of the sand\nbed, the generation and modification of sand ripples, and strong tidal modulation of\nthe current and wave velocities on semi-diurnal, diurnal, and spring/neap time scales.\nThe data set is unique in containing concurrent velocity time series, of several weeks\nduration, with coverage from 1 cm to 20 cm above the bottom.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution June 1997ONR has contributed\nsubstantial financial support to this research and to my graduate education\nthrough AASERT funding under ONR Grant N00014-93-1-1140.

  "texts" : [ "High-Resolution Spectroscopy of Extremely Metal-Poor Stars from SDSS/SEGUE: I. Atmospheric Parameters and Chemical Compositions", "Chemical compositions are determined based on high-resolution spectroscopy for 137 candidate extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and its first stellar extension, the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE). High-resolution spectra with moderate signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios were obtained with the High Dispersion Spectrograph of the Subaru Telescope. Most of the sample (approximately 80%) are main-sequence turnoff stars, including dwarfs and subgiants. Four cool main-sequence stars, the most metal-deficient such stars known, are included in the remaining sample. Good agreement is found between effective temperatures estimated by the SEGUE stellar parameter pipeline, based on the SDSS/SEGUE medium-resolution spectra, and those estimated from the broadband (V – K)[subscript 0] and (g – r)[subscript 0] colors. Our abundance measurements reveal that 70 stars in our sample have [Fe/H] < –3, adding a significant number of EMP stars to the currently known sample. Our analyses determine the abundances of eight elements (C, Na, Mg, Ca, Ti, Cr, Sr, and Ba) in addition to Fe. The fraction of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars ([C/Fe] > +0.7) among the 25 giants in our sample is as high as 36%, while only a lower limit on the fraction (9%) is estimated for turnoff stars. This paper is the first of a series of papers based on these observational results. The following papers in this series will discuss the higher-resolution and higher-S/N observations of a subset of this sample, the metallicity distribution function, binarity, and correlations between the chemical composition and kinematics of extremely metal-poor stars.", null ],

  "texts" : [ "Dendritic cells and the assessment in vitro of skin sensitizing potential.", "It is now well established that dendritic cells (DC) play pivotal roles in the initiation and orchestration of adaptive immune responses, including cutaneous immune responses to chemical allergens that drive the acquisition of skin sensitization. It is not unexpected, therefore, that a large number, and wide variety, of proposed approaches for the identification of skin sensitizing chemicals in vitro are based upon the use of cultured DC or DC-like cells. The use of DC in this context is legitimate. However, with our rapidly increasing understanding of the diversity of cutaneous DC with respect to both phenotype and function, it is timely now to review briefly the potential limitations and interpretive difficulties that are associated with the use of DC-based assays. Among the important considerations are the fact that chemical-induced changes in the characteristics and function of cultured DC will not necessarily reflect accurately the events that that support the development of skin sensitization in vivo. In addition, most DC-based assays are predicated on a view that cutaneous DC have as their primary function the initiation of adaptive immune responses. However, it is now appreciated that cutaneous DC, and in particular epidermal Langerhans cells (LC), may also play important immunoregulatory roles that serve to limit and contain skin immune responses. Notwithstanding these considerations there is reason to believe that at least some in vitro DC-based assays are of value, and indeed some are currently the subject of a formal validation process. However, it is appropriate that such assays are configured and interpreted carefully, and with an appreciation of the complexity of DC biology.", null ],

Core promoters have been studied intensively in mammals and yeast, but not in more diverse eukaryotes. Here we investigate core promoters in oomycetes, a group within the Stramenopile kingdom that includes important plant and animal pathogens. Prior studies of a small collection of genes proposed that oomycete core promoters contain a 16 to 19 nt motif bearing an Initiator-like sequence (INR) flanked by a novel sequence named FPR, but this has not been extended to whole-genome analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tResults\n\t\t\t\t\tWe used expectation maximization to find over-represented motifs near TSSs of Phytophthora infestans, the potato blight pathogen. The motifs corresponded to INR, FPR, and a new element found about 25 nt downstream of the TSS called DPEP. TATA boxes were not detected. Assays of DPEP function by mutagenesis were consistent with its role as a core motif. Genome-wide searches found a well-conserved combined INR+FPR in only about 13% of genes after correcting for false discovery, which contradicted prior reports that INR and FPR are found together in most genes. INR or FPR were found alone near TSSs in 18% and 7% of genes, respectively. Promoters lacking the motifs had pyrimidine-rich regions near the TSS. The combined INR+FPR motif was linked to higher than average mRNA levels, developmentally-regulated transcription, and functions related to plant infection, while DPEP and FPR were over-represented in constitutively-expressed genes. The INR, FPR, and combined INR+FPR motifs were detected in other oomycetes including Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, Phytophthora sojae, Pythium ultimum, and Saprolegnia parasitica, while DPEP was found in all but S. parasitica. Only INR seemed present in a non-oomycete stramenopile.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConclusions\n\t\t\t\t\tThe absence of a TATA box and presence of novel motifs show that the oomycete core promoter is diverged from that of model systems, and likely explains the lack of activity of non-oomycete promoters in Phytophthora transformants. The association of the INR+FPR motif with developmentally-regulated genes shows that oomycete core elements influence stage-specific transcription in addition to regulating formation of the pre-initiation complex.", null ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Relative efficiency of land surface energy balance components", "[1] The partitioning of available energy into dissipative fluxes over land surfaces is dependent on the state variable of the surface energy balance (land surface temperature) and the state variable of the surface water balance (soil moisture). The direct measurement of the turbulent fluxes is achieved with in situ instruments at tower sites. These point-scale measurements are sparsely distributed. Broader scale mapping of the turbulent fluxes is mostly dependent on land surface temperature (LST) and optical/infrared vegetation that can be sensed remotely. There are several data assimilation approaches currently in use that intake sequences of daytime LST that attain different diurnal amplitudes depending on available energy and the relative efficiency of surface energy balance to infer the magnitude of surface flux components such as latent and sensible heat flux. In this study we perform stability analysis on the evolution of LST in order to provide insights into the physical bases for why LST variations can be used to diagnose surface energy balance (SEB) components. The derived relative efficiencies of SEB components in dissipating available energy at the land surface are tested using two field experiment measurements. The results show that the theoretically derived relative efficiencies of SEB components agree well with field observations. The study provides insight into how LST sequences implicitly contain the signature of partitioning of available energy among SEB components and can be used to infer their magnitudes.", null ],

  "texts" : [ "Computational drug design applied to neglected disease", "Herein is described the identification of novel inhibitors of key pathogenic proteins, the use of established computational techniques to further drug discovery, and the development of novel computational methods, with the ultimate goal of identifying small-molecule compounds that, with further development, may serve as future treatments for neglected diseases. Two of the pathogens targeted, Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi, are neglected because they are tropical, and drugs marketed solely to the developing world are rarely profitable. A third disease, H1N1 pandemic influenza, is somewhat neglected because it is only now emergent. For Trypanosoma brucei, two drug-discovery projects are described, focusing on two crucial enzymes : UDP-galactose 4'-epimerase and RNA editing ligase 1. For Trypanosoma cruzi, the dynamics of cruzain, a crucial cysteine protease, are studied and characterized. Finally, for influenza, predicted inhibitors of neuraminidase (N1) are presented. Aside from describing identified enzyme inhibitors, the current work also describes several new methods that may be generally applicable to drug discovery. These new methods include a multidimensional strategy for the identification of secondary targets of known small-molecule inhibitors in the absence of global structural and sequence homology with the primary target protein, a novel computer-aided drug design algorithm (AutoGrow) that combines the strengths of both fragment-based growing and docking algorithms, and an extension to the relaxed complex scheme that accounts for both population-shift and induced-fit contributions to ligand binding", null ],

  "texts" : [ "Rapid reagentless quantification of alginate biosynthesis in Pseudomonas fluorescens bacteria mutants using FT-IR spectroscopy coupled to multivariate partial least squares regression.", "Alginate is an important medical and commercial product and currently is isolated from seaweeds. Certain microorganisms also produce alginate and these polymers have the potential to replace seaweed alginates in some applications, mainly because such production will allow much better and more reproducible control of critical qualitative polymer properties. The research conducted here presents the development of a new approach to this problem by analysing a transposon insertion mutant library constructed in an alginate-producing derivative of the Pseudomonas fluorescens strain SBW25. The procedure is based on the non-destructive and reagent-free method of Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy which is used to generate a complex biochemical infrared fingerprint of the medium after bacterial growth. First, we investigate the potential differences caused by the growth media fructose and glycerol on the bacterial phenotype and alginate synthesis in 193 selected P. fluorescens mutants and show that clear phenotypic differences are observed in the infrared fingerprints. In order to quantify the level of the alginate we also report the construction and interpretation of multivariate partial least squares regression models which were able to quantify alginate levels successfully with typical normalized root-mean-square error in predictions of only approximately 14%. We have demonstrated that this high-throughput approach can be implemented in alginate screens and we believe that this FT-IR spectroscopic methodology, when combined with the most appropriate chemometrics, could easily be modified for the quantification of other valuable microbial products and play a valuable screening role for synthetic biology.", null ],
