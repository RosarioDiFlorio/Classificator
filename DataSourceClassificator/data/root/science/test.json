  "description" : "PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between human papillomavirus (HPV) genotype and outcome after radiation therapy and intrinsic radiosensitivity. METHODS AND MATERIALS: HPV genotyping was performed on cervix biopsies by polymerase chain reaction using SPF-10 broad-spectrum primers, followed by deoxyribonucleic acid enzyme immunoassay and genotyping by reverse hybridization line probe assay (LiPA(25)) (version 1) (n=202). PapilloCheck and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were used to genotype cervix cancer cell lines (n=16). Local progression-free survival after radiation therapy alone was assessed using log-rank and Cox proportionate hazard analyses. Intrinsic radiosensitivity was measured as surviving fraction at 2 Gy (SF2) using clonogenic assays. RESULTS: Of the 202 tumors, 107 (53.0%) were positive for HPV16, 29 (14.4%) for HPV18, 9 (4.5%) for HPV45, 23 (11.4%) for other HPV genotypes, and 22 (10.9%) were negative; 11 (5.5%) contained multiple genotypes, and 1 tumor was HPV X (0.5%). In 148 patients with outcome data, those with HPVα9-positive tumors had better local progression-free survival compared with α7 patients in univariate (P<.004) and multivariate (hazard ratio 1.54, 95% confidence interval 1.11-1.76, P=.021) analyses. There was no difference in the median SF2 of α9 and α7 cervical tumors (n=63). In the cell lines, 9 were α7 and 4 α9 positive and 3 negative.

In particular, previous works demonstrated that neural cells are able toadhere and proliferate on micropitted PCL films obtained through solvent casting. Also,short term studies showed that axons were able to bridge 1cm injury gap. In this work a18 weeks long term in vivo experiment using a rat model was performed to investigatethe reinnervation of end organ skin and muscle. PCL conduits were compared toautografts, with no significant differences in terms of regeneration and reinnervation.However, Schwann cells (SCs), the most important glial cells in the peripheral nervoussystem, showed poor attachment in vitro on PCL scaffolds; hence, surface modificationwas carried out in order to improve the material biocompatibility. The effect of bothhydrophilicity and functional groups on SCs was first investigated. PCL films were thenhydrolysed and aminolysed to modify the surface with carboxylic and amino groupsrespectively. Hydrolysed films increased remarkably the surface hydrophilicity,although topography and mechanical properties were not affected. Conversely, thetensile modulus and strength were significantly reduced by aminolysis, but still suitablefor the desired application. The two treatments influenced also the morphology of SCs.It was demonstrated that cell elongation was induced by hydrophilic surfaces, whilstcells preferred cell-cell interaction when cultured on aminolysed films. However, cellproliferation was remarkably increased on the latter surfaces, confirming previousresults obtained on substrates characterised by amino groups. These results confirmedthat a good balance between hydophilicity and surface chemistry is necessary toguarantee the best cell response.

Biologicaltests performed on these modified films demonstrated the improvement of SC responseafter the peptide immobilisation using the novel approach. Cell attachment andproliferation were three times higher compared to untreated PCL films. It was alsoobserved that the presence of peptides on the film surface induced the formation of focaladhesion plaques by SCs, important for the perception of cellular signals when incontact with a particular substrate.

  "description" : "Excessive inflammation during bacterial and viral infections is destructive to the host and involves elevated production of proinflammatory cytokines.

Indeed, a number of viruses that infect lungs, such as avian influenza virus, SARS-associated coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus, elicit a very high level of proinflammatory cytokines; however, it is unclear what triggers their production. In this study, we show that IL-17 commonly produced during viral infection specifically augments a proinflammatory response by directly synergizing with antiviral signaling.

Knockdown of expression of known mediators of the antiviral signaling pathway revealed that the IL-17-poly(I:C) synergy depends on the presence of the transcriptional factors RelA and IFN regulatory factor 3 and IκB kinases. Moreover, this synergy was blocked by an IκB kinase inhibitor, BAY 11-7082.

  "title" : "A function for Rac1 in the terminal differentiation and pigmentation of hair.",
  "description" : "The small GTPase Rac1 is ubiquitously expressed in proliferating and differentiating layers of the epidermis and hair follicles. Previously, Rac1 was shown to regulate stem cell behaviour in these compartments. We have asked whether Rac1 has, in addition, a specific, stem-cell-independent function in the regulation of terminal hair follicle differentiation. To address this, we have expressed a constitutively active mutant of Rac1, L61Rac1, only in the basal epidermal layer and outer root sheath of mice possessing an epidermis-specific deletion of endogenous Rac1, which experience severe hair loss. The resulting 'rescue' mice exhibited a hair coat throughout their lives. Therefore, expression of Rac1 activity in the keratin-14-positive compartment of the skin is sufficient for the formation of hair follicles and hair in normal quantities. The quality of hair formed in rescue mice was, however, not normal. Rescue mice showed a grey, dull hair coat, whereas that of wild-type and L61Rac1-transgenic mice was black and shiny. Hair analysis in rescue mice revealed altered structures of the hair shaft and the cuticle and disturbed organization of medulla cells and pigment distribution. Disorganization of medulla cells correlates with the absence of cortical, keratin-filled spikes that normally protrude from the cortex into the medulla. The desmosomal cadherin Dsc2, which normally decorates these protrusions, was found to be reduced or absent in the hair of rescue mice. Our study demonstrates regulatory functions for Rac1 in the formation of hair structure and pigmentation and thereby identifies, for the first time, a role for Rac1 in terminal differentiation.",

  "description" : "Relatively little research has examined factors that account for transitions between transtheoretical model (TTM) stages of change. The present study (N = 787) used sociodemographic, TTM, and theory of planned behavior (TPB) variables, as well as theory-driven interventions to predict changes in stage. Longitudinal analyses revealed that sociodemographic, TPB, and 1 of the interventions predicted transitions between most stages of change.

  "description" : "Airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells undergo remodelling and reside in a tissue structure that is subject to heterogenous stress distributions that change dynamically during the breathing cycle. In this paper, we develop a structural model of an ASM cell that consists of contractile units (actin and myosin filaments) in series and parallel, anchored to a nonlinearly elastic cytoskeleton. We mimic a typical experimental protocol that involves isometric force generation through triggering of the contractile machinery, followed by oscillatory length fluctuation of the cell. We use the model to predict the effect of a single instance of rearrangement of the contractile machinery, combined with strain-stiffening of the cytoskeleton, on the force generated by the sarcomeres, and the total force generated by the cell. By linking intra-cellular events to whole-cell behaviour, the model reveals mechanistic relationships between structural properties and cell-level force–length loops. We show how contractile force, shortening velocity and sarcomere operating lengths vary as the internal cell architecture is altered. Additionally, we show how interactions between the internal contractile machinery and cytoskeletal structure play a role in the regulation of force generation and hysteresis of the cell.",

  "description" : "Unique biochemical and physical challenges to both mother and fetus are observed during human pregnancy, and the placenta plays an important role in protecting the fetus and supporting its development. Consequently, many pregnancy complications are associated with altered placental biochemistry and structure. Here we have further developed a combination of analytical tools for determining the tissue metabolome of placental tissue by applying a methanol/water/chloroform extraction method followed by analysis of the polar fraction (methanol/water) using GC–ToF–MS and of the non-polar fraction (chloroform) using UPLC–LTQ–Orbitrap–MS. This combination maximises the number of different metabolites detected and is the first holistic investigation of placental tissue applying UPLC–MS. Placental tissue differs between early and late first trimester pregnancies in that the developing placenta is exposed to significantly different oxygen tensions and undergoes a change from histiotrophic to haemotrophic nutrition. Application of these metabolomic methods detected 156 unique and chemically identified metabolites that showed statistically significant differences (P < 0.05). These included changes in di- and triglycerides, phospholipids, sphingolipids, fatty acids and fatty acid carnitines. This is the first metabolomics study to identify these changes that potentially show the initiation or switch to fatty acid beta-oxidation for mitochondrial ATP production. A separate study showed a small number of changes that were related to the position of sampling of the placental tissue and to the type of delivery from pregnancy. This result indicates that variations associated with sampling position and delivery type are small compared to between-subject variation. However, the authors recommend robust experimental design which may include sampling from the same position of the placenta and from the same delivery type. When comparing tissue from term-uncomplicated pregnancies with those exhibiting preeclampsia at term, 86 unique and chemically identified metabolites showed statistically significant differences (P < 0.05). Potential changes in metabolism operating in the mitochondria, in vitamin D metabolism and in oxidative and nitrative stress were observed.

These results imply that STAT-1 plays a crucial role in the DNA-damage-response by regulating the expression of 53BP1 and MDC1, factors known to be important for mediating ATM-dependent checkpoint pathways.", null ],

  "description" : "BACKGROUND: Many surgical procedures are complicated by adhesions. These restrictive fibrotic bands form between normally separate gliding tissue layers, potentially impairing function. The authors tested the adhesion-modifying effect of a novel fibronectin-derived biomimetic biomaterial in a tendon-synovial complex injury model. METHODS: The deep flexor tendons of digits 2 and 4 in the right forepaw of 15 New Zealand White rabbits were subjected to 5-mm-long partial tenotomies. Animals were randomized to receive biomaterial tubes enveloping the tendon injuries or left untreated. Digits, amputated at 2 weeks, were randomized to mechanical pullout assessments of adhesion strength or to quantitative histologic cellularity and immunohistochemical proliferation (Ki67) assessments. RESULTS: The mean peak pullout force required to break the adhesions was reduced from 7.70 N (n = 6) in untreated digits to 0.31 N (n = 7) in biomaterial-treated digits (p = 0.001). The mean structural stiffness of the adhesions was also significantly reduced (p = 0.001). Histologically, treated and untreated digits demonstrated an equal incidence of adhesions. The treated adhesions were 55 percent less cellular at their surface than the untreated injured controls (p = 0.003). Treated tendons were 8 percent more cellular (with equal numbers of proliferating cells) at their surface and significantly more cellular within their bulk than positive controls (p <or= 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study suggests a significant reduction in the restrictive nature of postsurgical adhesions following treatment with the antiadhesive biomaterial without compromising tendon cellularity.",

Collagen is important as it allows tissues of the body to endure the constant forces of being pulled, pushed and squashed.

  "description" : "Relativistic effects are extremely important for heavy atoms and heavy atom containing molecules. Therefore, a relativistic treatment is needed when calculating molecular properties of these species. The fully- relativistic Dirac treatment involves electronic and positronic wavefunctions and a very large basis set is required.

The Zeroth-Order Regular Approximation (ZORA) is an approximation to the Dirac approach, which only deals with the electronic wavefunction. However, unfortunately this method is plagued by the gauge-dependence problem. The gauge-independent ZORA (ZORA-GI) and strictly atomic ZORA approaches provide solutions to this problem.In this work, the ZORA-GI and strictly atomic ZORA codes have been successfully implemented into the Gaussian 09 program. They have been used to calculate the bond lengths, harmonic vibrational frequencies and dissociation energies of the I2, Au2 and Pt2 diatomic molecules. The results show good agreement with experiment and previous theoretical studies. The non-relativistic, ZORA-GI, strictly atomic ZORA and pseudopotential approximations have been used to investigate the electronic structure of the actinide monoxides, AnO, and actinide monoxide cations, AnO+ (An = Th – Cm). It was found that the ground state configurations were dependent on the relativistic approximation chosen.

  "description" : "The aim of this work is to study the role of pore residues on drug binding in the Na(V)1.8 channel. Alanine mutations were made in the S6 segments, chosen on the basis of their roles in other Na(V) subtypes; whole cell patch clamp recordings were made from mammalian ND7/23 cells. Mutations of some residues caused shifts in voltage dependence of activation and inactivation, and gave faster time course of inactivation, indicating that the residues mutated play important roles in both activation and inactivation in the Na(V)1.8 channel. The resting and inactivated state affinities of tetracaine for the channel were reduced by mutations I381A, F1710A, and Y1717A (for the latter only inactivated state affinity was measured), and by mutation F1710A for the Na(V)1.8-selective compound A-803467, showing the involvement of these residues for each compound, respectively.

  "texts" : [ "Structural determinants of drugs acting on the Nav1.8 channel.", "The aim of this work is to study the role of pore residues on drug binding in the Na(V)1.8 channel. Alanine mutations were made in the S6 segments, chosen on the basis of their roles in other Na(V) subtypes; whole cell patch clamp recordings were made from mammalian ND7/23 cells. Mutations of some residues caused shifts in voltage dependence of activation and inactivation, and gave faster time course of inactivation, indicating that the residues mutated play important roles in both activation and inactivation in the Na(V)1.8 channel. The resting and inactivated state affinities of tetracaine for the channel were reduced by mutations I381A, F1710A, and Y1717A (for the latter only inactivated state affinity was measured), and by mutation F1710A for the Na(V)1.8-selective compound A-803467, showing the involvement of these residues for each compound, respectively.

LV-WT-HSCT results in 10% of normal brain enzyme activity, near normalization of brain HS and GM2 gangliosides, significant improvements in neuroinflammation and behavioral correction. Both WT-HSCT and LV-IIIA-HSCT mediated improvements in GM2 gangliosides and neuroinflammation but were less effective at reducing HS or in ameliorating abnormal HS sulfation and had no significant effect on behavior. This suggests that HS may have a more significant role in neuropathology than neuroinflammation or GM2 gangliosides.

  "description" : "BACKGROUND: the link between the vitamin D endocrine axis and frailty remains undefined, with few studies examining the joint effect of vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Our objective was to determine the association of frailty with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and PTH.Setting: cross-sectional analysis within the European Male Ageing Study (EMAS).Participants: a total of 1,504 community-dwelling men aged 60-79 years. METHODS: frailty was classified using a frailty phenotype (FP) and frailty index (FI). The association of frailty with 25(OH)D and PTH was examined using multinomial logistic regression; individual FP criteria with 25(OH)D and PTH using binary logistic regression. Results were expressed as relative odds ratios (ROR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for multinomial; odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs for binary models. RESULTS: using the FP, 5.0% of subjects were classified as frail and 36.6% as prefrail. Lower levels of 25(OH)D were associated with being prefrail (per 1 SD decrease: ROR = 1.45; 95% CI: 1.26-1.67) and frail (ROR = 1.89; 95% CI: 1.30-2.76), after adjusting for age, centre and health and lifestyle confounders (robust group = base category). Higher levels of PTH were associated with being frail after adjustment for confounders (per 1 SD increase: ROR = 1.24; 95% CI: 1.01-1.52). Comparable results were found using the FI. Among the five FP criteria only sarcopenia was not associated with 25(OH)D levels, while only weakness was associated with PTH. CONCLUSION: lower 25(OH)D and higher PTH levels were positively associated with frailty in older men. Prospective data would enable the temporal nature of this relationship to be explored further.",

  "description" : "We report that two classes of membrane nanotubes between human monocyte-derived macrophages can be distinguished by their cytoskeletal structure and their functional properties. Thin membrane nanotubes contained only F-actin, whereas thicker nanotubes, i.e., those > approximately 0.7 microm in diameter, contained both F-actin and microtubules. Bacteria could be trapped and surf along thin, but not thick, membrane nanotubes toward connected macrophage cell bodies. Once at the cell body, bacteria could then be phagocytosed. The movement of bacteria is aided by a constitutive flow of the nanotube surface because streptavidin-coated beads were similarly able to traffic along nanotubes between surface-biotinylated macrophages. Mitochondria and intracellular vesicles, including late endosomes and lysosomes, could be detected within thick, but not thin, membrane nanotubes. Analysis from kymographs demonstrated that vesicles moved in a stepwise, bidirectional manner at approximately 1 microm/s, consistent with their traffic being mediated by the microtubules found only in thick nanotubes. Vesicular traffic in thick nanotubes and surfing of beads along thin nanotubes were both stopped upon the addition of azide, demonstrating that both processes require ATP. However, microtubule destabilizing agents colchicine or nocodazole abrogated vesicular transport but not the flow of the nanotube surface, confirming that distinct cytoskeletal structures of nanotubes give rise to different functional properties.

  "title" : "Intestinal microbiota in functional bowel disorders: a Rome foundation report.",
  "description" : "It is increasingly perceived that gut host-microbial interactions are important elements in the pathogenesis of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID). The most convincing evidence to date is the finding that functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may develop in predisposed individuals following a bout of infectious gastroenteritis. There has been a great deal of interest in the potential clinical and therapeutic implications of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in IBS. However, this theory has generated much debate because the evidence is largely based on breath tests which have not been validated. The introduction of culture-independent molecular techniques provides a major advancement in our understanding of the microbial community in FGID. Results from 16S rRNA-based microbiota profiling approaches demonstrate both quantitative and qualitative changes of mucosal and faecal gut microbiota, particularly in IBS. Investigators are also starting to measure host-microbial interactions in IBS. The current working hypothesis is that abnormal microbiota activate mucosal innate immune responses which increase epithelial permeability, activate nociceptive sensory pathways and dysregulate the enteric nervous system. While we await important insights in this field, the microbiota is already a therapeutic target. Existing controlled trials of dietary manipulation, prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics and non-absorbable antibiotics are promising, although most are limited by suboptimal design and small sample size.

  "texts" : [ "Intestinal microbiota in functional bowel disorders: a Rome foundation report.", "It is increasingly perceived that gut host-microbial interactions are important elements in the pathogenesis of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID). The most convincing evidence to date is the finding that functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may develop in predisposed individuals following a bout of infectious gastroenteritis. There has been a great deal of interest in the potential clinical and therapeutic implications of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in IBS. However, this theory has generated much debate because the evidence is largely based on breath tests which have not been validated. The introduction of culture-independent molecular techniques provides a major advancement in our understanding of the microbial community in FGID. Results from 16S rRNA-based microbiota profiling approaches demonstrate both quantitative and qualitative changes of mucosal and faecal gut microbiota, particularly in IBS. Investigators are also starting to measure host-microbial interactions in IBS. The current working hypothesis is that abnormal microbiota activate mucosal innate immune responses which increase epithelial permeability, activate nociceptive sensory pathways and dysregulate the enteric nervous system. While we await important insights in this field, the microbiota is already a therapeutic target. Existing controlled trials of dietary manipulation, prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics and non-absorbable antibiotics are promising, although most are limited by suboptimal design and small sample size.

  "title" : "THE PERFORMANCE OF A NUCLEAR FUEL-MATRIX MATERIAL IN A SEALED CO2 SYSTEM",
  "description" : "An advanced concept high temperature reactor (HTR) design has been proposed - The ‘U-Battery’, which utilises a unique sealed coolant loop, and is intended to operate with minimal human oversight. In order to reduce the need for moving parts within the design, CO2 has been selected as a candidate coolant, potentially allowing a naturally circulated system.HTR fuel is held within a semi-graphitic fuel-matrix material, and this has not previously been tested within a CO2 environment. Graphite in CO2 is subject to two oxidation reactions, one thermally driven and one radiolytically. As such, the oxi- dation performance of fuel-matrix material has been tested within CO2 at both high temperatures and under ionising radiation within a sealed-system.Performance has been compared to that of the Gilsocarbon and NBG-18 nuclear graphite grades. Gilsocarbon is the primary graphite grade used within the currently operating AGR fleet within the UK, and as such is known to have acceptable oxidation performance under reactor conditions. NBG-18 is a modern graphite grade, and is a candidate material for use within the U-Battery. Virgin characterisation of all materi- als was performed, including measurements of bulk mass and volume, skeletal volumes and surface areas. High-resolution optical microscopy has also been performed and pore size distributions inferred from digital image analysis. All results were seen to agree well with literature values, and the variation between samples has been quanti- fied and found to be < 10% between samples of Gilsocarbon, and < 4% for samples of fuel-matrix and NBG-18.Thermal performance of fuel-matrix material was observed between 600 ◦C – 1200 ◦C and seen to be broadly comparable to that of the nuclear graphite grades tested. NBG-18 showed surprisingly poor performance at 600◦C, with an oxidation rate of 3×10−4%/min, approximately ten times faster than Gilsocarbon in similar conditions, and three times faster than fuel-matrix material. The radiolytic oxidation performance of fuel-matrix material and NBG-18 has been observed by irradiating sealed quartz ampoules. Ampoules were pressurised with CO2 prior to irradiation, and the pres- sure after 30 days of irradiation was measured and seen to fall by 50%. Radiolytic oxidation, and the subsequent radiolysis of the reaction product, CO, was seen to cause significant carbonaceous deposition on the internal surfaces of the ampoule and throughout the samples. Due to the short irradiation times available in the present study, an investigation of the microporosity within irradiated samples has been carried out, using nitrogen adsorption and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). Pore size distributions produced from SANS show the closure of microporosity within NBG-18, most likely as a result of low-temperature neutron irradiation.As a result of this work, CO2 is no longer a candidate coolant for use with the U-Battery design, due to the rapid deposition observed following irradiation.",

  "description" : "To characterize the metabolic role of peroxisomes in yeast cells under physiological conditions, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of published microarray data. Previous studies of yeast peroxisomes have mainly been focused on the function of peroxisomes under extreme conditions, such as growth on oleate or methanol as the sole carbon source, and may therefore not be representative of the normal physiological role of yeast peroxisomes. Surprisingly, our analysis of the microarray data reveals that the only pathway responding to peroxisome deficiency in mid-log phase is lysine biosynthesis, whereas classical peroxisomal pathways such as beta-oxidation are unaffected. We show that the upregulation of lysine biosynthesis genes in peroxisome-deficient yeasts shares many characteristics with the physiological response to lysine starvation. We provide data that suggest that this is the result of a \"pathological\" stimulation of the Lys14p transcriptional activator by the pathway intermediate aminoadipate semialdehyde. Mistargeting of the peroxisomal lysine pathway to the cytosol increases the active concentration of aminoadipate semialdehyde, which is no longer contained in the peroxisome and can now activate Lys14p at much lower levels than in wild-type yeasts. This is the first well-documented example of pathway misregulation in response to peroxisome deficiency and will be useful in understanding the phenotypic details of human peroxisome-deficient patients (Zellweger syndrome).",

  "description" : "Inclusions in the brain containing ??-synuclein are the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease, but how these inclusions are formed and how this links to disease is poorly understood. We have developed a C. elegans model that makes it possible to monitor, in living animals, the formation of ??-synuclein inclusions. In worms of old age, inclusions contain aggregated ??-synuclein, resembling a critical pathological feature. We used genome-wide RNA interference to identify processes involved in inclusion formation, and identified 80 genes that, when knocked down, resulted in a premature increase in the number of inclusions. Quality control and vesicle-trafficking genes expressed in the ER/Golgi complex and vesicular compartments were overrepresented, indicating a specific role for these processes in ??-synuclein inclusion formation. Suppressors include aging-associated genes, such as sir-2.1/SIRT1 and lagr-1/LASS2. Altogether, our data suggest a link between ??-synuclein inclusion formation and cellular aging, likely through an endomembrane-related mechanism.

This has been a major issue for the imaging of immune synapses between live cells, which has generally required the reconstruction of en face intercellular synapses, yielding spatial resolution significantly above the diffraction limit and updating at only a few frames per minute. Strategies to address this issue have usually involved using artificial activating substrates such as antibody-coated slides or supported planar lipid bilayers, but synapses with these surrogate stimuli may not wholly resemble immune synapses between two cells. Here, we combine optical tweezers and confocal microscopy to realize generally applicable, high-speed, high-resolution imaging of almost any arbitrary plane of interest. Applied to imaging immune synapses in live-cell conjugates, this has enabled the characterization of complex behavior of highly dynamic clusters of T cell receptors at the T cell/antigen-presenting cell intercellular immune synapse and revealed the presence of numerous, highly dynamic long receptor-rich filopodial structures within inhibitory Natural Killer cell immune synapses.",

  "description" : "Previously, we proposed that cancer cells behave as metabolic parasites, as they use targeted oxidative stress as a \"weapon\" to extract recycled nutrients from adjacent stromal cells. Oxidative stress in cancer-associated fibroblasts triggers autophagy and  mitophagy, resulting in compartmentalized cellular catabolism, loss of mitochondrial function, and the onset of aerobic glycolysis, in the tumor stroma. As such, cancer-associated fibroblasts produce high-energy nutrients (such as lactate and ketones) that fuel mitochondrial biogenesis, and oxidative metabolism in cancer cells. We have termed this new energy-transfer mechanism the \"reverse Warburg effect.\" To further test the validity of this hypothesis, here we used an in vitro MCF7-fibroblast co-culture system, and quantitatively measured a variety of metabolic parameters by FACS analysis (analogous to laser-capture micro-dissection).  Mitochondrial activity, glucose uptake, and ROS production were measured with highly-sensitive fluorescent probes (MitoTracker, NBD-2-deoxy-glucose, and DCF-DA). Interestingly, using this approach, we directly show that cancer cells initially secrete hydrogen peroxide that then triggers oxidative stress in neighboring fibroblasts. Thus, oxidative stress is contagious (spreads like a virus) and is propagated laterally and vectorially from cancer cells to adjacent fibroblasts. Experimentally, we show that oxidative stress in cancer-associated fibroblasts quantitatively reduces mitochondrial activity, and increases glucose uptake, as the fibroblasts become more dependent on aerobic glycolysis.  Conversely, co-cultured cancer cells show significant increases in mitochondrial activity, and corresponding reductions in both glucose uptake and GLUT1 expression. Pre-treatment of co-cultures with extracellular catalase (an anti-oxidant enzyme that detoxifies hydrogen peroxide) blocks the onset of oxidative stress, and potently induces the death of cancer cells, likely via starvation.  Given that cancer-associated fibroblasts show the largest increases in glucose uptake, we suggest that PET imaging of human tumors, with Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (F-2-DG), may be specifically detecting the tumor stroma, rather than epithelial cancer cells.",

  "description" : "FrpB is an outer membrane transporter from , the causative agent of meningococcal meningitis. It is a member of the TonB-dependent transporter (TBDT) family and is responsible for iron uptake into the periplasm. FrpB is subject to a high degree of antigenic variation, principally through a region of hypervariable sequence exposed at the cell surface. From the crystal structures of two FrpB antigenic variants, we identify a bound ferric ion within the structure which induces structural changes on binding which are consistent with it being the transported substrate. Binding experiments, followed by elemental analysis, verified that FrpB binds Fe with high affinity. EPR spectra of the bound Fe ion confirmed that its chemical environment was consistent with that observed in the crystal structure. Fe binding was reduced or abolished on mutation of the Fe-chelating residues. FrpB orthologs were identified in other Gram-negative bacteria which showed absolute conservation of the coordinating residues, suggesting the existence of a specific TBDT sub-family dedicated to the transport of Fe. The region of antigenic hypervariability lies in a separate, external sub-domain, whose structure is conserved in both the F3-3 and F5-1 variants, despite their sequence divergence. We conclude that the antigenic sub-domain has arisen separately as a result of immune selection pressure to distract the immune response from the primary transport function. This would enable FrpB to function as a transporter independently of antibody binding, by using the antigenic sub-domain as a 'molecular decoy' to distract immune surveillance.",

Importantly, treatment with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine abolishes the glutamine-induced augmentation of mitochondrial mass. It is known that loss of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) expression in fibroblasts is associated with increased autophagy and an aggressive tumor microenvironment.

  "title" : "Characterising the Innate and Adaptive Immune Response to Intestinal Helminth Infection",
  "description" : "Gastrointestinal parasites are one of the most prevalent infections known to infect mammals, estimated to affect over one billion people globally. It is well established that the generation of a type two response, characterised by CD4+ T cell secretion of interleukin (IL)-13, IL-4 and IL-9 will expel most gastrointestinal helminths. Expulsion is mediated by a variety of effector mechanisms including altered mucin production, intestinal mast cell activation, increased epithelial cell turnover and increased muscle contraction. Protective immunity can be generated over time; however, infections can persist to chronicity following the modulation of a protective type two response, such as the generation of a type one response. This response, characterised by IFN-γ and IL 12 secretion, can lead to long lived infections, placing huge morbidity upon infected individuals. The mechanisms leading to the generation of a type one or type two response are not fully understood and are of paramount importance if a vaccine to helminth parasites is to be developed. In addition, the dysregulation of these responses is thought to be the cause of allergy and autoimmunity and understanding the regulation of type two responses will also add to our understanding of these diseases.Numerous labs have recently reported roles for new innate cells, such as nuocytes, as sources of IL 13, a cytokine critical to worm expulsion.  In addition, data from this lab have demonstrated that NK cell derived IL-13 is the cause of pathology during infection with Trichinella spiralis. It has also been shown that NK cells provide a supplementary source of IL-13 in Trichuris muris infected IL-4-/- mice. This thesis has used 2 strains of mice; the E4bp4-/- mouse and the Il13eGFP reporter mouse, in order to dissect the role of innate cells in the immune response to the related helminth parasites T. muris and T. spiralis. The transcription factor E4BP4 has been shown to control CD4+ T cell IL-5 and 13 secretion and the development of NK cells. Data presented in this thesis show that following a low dose infection, which usually persists to chronicity in WT mice, E4bp4-/- mice were able to expel the parasite following the generation of an elevated type two response. This effect was abrogated following CD4+ T cell depletion, indicative of an essential role for these cells in this response. It was also shown that E4BP4 ablation was sufficient to delay expulsion of a high dose of T. muris, indicative of a key role for E4BP4 in regulating type two responses to T. muris. Contrary to the hypothesis, it was demonstrated that NK cells did not play a major role in protective immunity to T. muris.In addition, the data presented here show, for the first time, the induction of nuocytes in the MLN following both T. muris and T. spiralis infection. Nuocytes made an early contribution to IL-13 secretion following T. spiralis infection; whereas low levels of Il13eGFP+ cells were observed only at day 18-21 post T. muris infection, with nuocytes making a less significant contribution to IL-13 levels. The levels of different cell lineages in the MLN post infection and their contribution to IL-13 expression was also mapped in detail.Finally, an analysis of the haematopoietic response in the bone marrow following T. muris infection was undertaken. The percentage and number of early progenitor Lineage-Sca-1+c-kit+ (LSK) cells in the bone marrow increased at day 21 post T. muris infection. LSK levels returned to normal after this time, indicative of an inflammation dependent response. Interestingly, E4bp4 ablation abrogated this effect, in line with the hypothesised role of IFN-γ in this expansion.

  "description" : "The effects of pH and hydrostatic pressure on the reaction of H463F tryptophan indole-lyase (TIL) have been evaluated.

Stopped-flow measurements show that the formation of the quinonoid intermediate at 505 nm is affected by pH, with a bell-shaped dependence for the forward rate constant, k(f), and dependence on a single basic group for the reverse rate constant, k(r), with the following values: pK(a1) = 8.14 ± 0.15, pK(a2) = 7.54 ± 0.15, k(f,min) = 18.1 ± 1.3 s(-1), k(f,max) = 179 ± 46.3 s(-1), k(r,min) = 11.4 ± 1.2 s(-1), and k(r,max) = 33 ± 1.6 s(-1). The pH effects may be due to ionization of Tyr74 as the base and Cys298 as the acid influencing the rate constant for deprotonation. High-pressure stopped-flow measurements were performed at pH 8, which is the optimum for the forward reaction. The rate constants show an increase with pressure up to 100 MPa and a subsequent decrease above 100 MPa. Fitting the pressure data gives the following values: k(f,0) = 15.4 ± 0.8 s(-1), ΔV(⧧) = -29.4 ± 2.9 cm(3) mol(-1), and Δβ(⧧) = -0.23 ± 0.03 cm(3) mol(-1) MPa(-1) for the forward reaction, and k(r,0) = 20.7 ± 0.8 s(-1), ΔV(⧧) = -9.6 ± 2.3 cm(3) mol(-1), and Δβ(⧧) = -0.05 ± 0.02 cm(3) mol(-1) MPa(-1) for the reverse reaction. The primary kinetic isotope effect on quinonoid intermediate formation at pH 8 is small (∼2) and is not significantly pressure-dependent, suggesting that the effect of pressure on k(f) may be due to perturbation of an active site preorganization step. The negative activation volume is also consistent with preorganization of the ES complex prior to quinonoid intermediate formation, and the negative compressibility may be due to the effect of pressure on the enzyme conformation. These results support the conclusion that the preorganization of the H463F TIL Trp complex, which is probably dominated by motion of the l-Trp indole moiety of the aldimine complex, contributes to quinonoid intermediate formation.",

In addition, a mutant of beta 2-microglobulin (Ser88Cys) that could be specifically labeled with Texas red (or other fluorescent probes) and exchanged into class I or class Ib MHC proteins was employed to study spontaneous internalization of MHC proteins by a non-perturbative method independent of an antibody ligand. These data are discussed in terms of both the role of HLA-G expressed on the fetal trophoblast and the function of the cytoplasmic tail in class I MHC proteins.", null ],

  "title" : "Prediction of missed proteolytic cleavages for the selection of surrogate peptides for quantitative proteomics.",
  "description" : "Abstract Quantitative proteomics experiments are usually performed using proteolytic peptides as surrogates for their parent proteins, inferring protein amounts from peptide-level quantitation. This process is frequently dependent on complete digestion of the parent protein to its limit peptides so that their signal is truly representative. Unfortunately, proteolysis is often incomplete, and missed cleavage peptides are frequently produced that are unlikely to be optimal surrogates for quantitation, particularly for label-mediated approaches seeking to derive absolute values. We have generated a predictive computational tool that is able to predict which candidate proteolytic peptide bonds are likely to be missed by the standard enzyme trypsin. Our cross-validated prediction tool uses support vector machines and achieves high accuracy in excess of 0.94 precision (PPV), with attendant high sensitivity of 0.79, across multiple proteomes. We believe this is a useful tool for selecting candidate quantotypic peptides, seeking to minimize likely loss owing to missed cleavage, which will be a boon for quantitative proteomic pipelines as well as other areas of proteomics. Our results are discussed in the context of recent results examining the kinetics of missed cleavages in proteomic digestion protocols, and show agreement with observed experimental trends.

  "description" : "Since its discovery, the one atom thick material graphene has been at the centre of growing interest in two-dimensional materials. Due to its exceptional properties, graphene is a rich topic to explore by physicists, chemists, engineers and materials scientists. In addition to its use in the fundamental research, graphene is also a promising candidate for future electronics, photonics and energy storage devices.The project presented in this thesis was carried out to explore the structure of suspended graphene in particular in order to probe the metal-graphene interaction via Transmission Electron Microscopy, as most graphene applications require interfacing with metals. As the work was based on free standing graphene, graphene layers obtained by mechanical cleavage or growth on a substrate were transferred onto TEM-grids. Therefore, fabrication, suspended sample preparation and identification of graphene layers were first discussed for a better understanding of how to obtain high quality graphene, as this was essential for the rest of the project.Structural, topographic and chemical analysis of pristine suspended graphene layers were investigated in detail via Transmission Electron Microscopy and Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy. The latter technique was also employed for graphene on a substrate along with establishing annealing conditions for residue free graphene.Metal deposited suspended graphene layers were then investigated in the electron microscopes. Different metal behaviours were observed on the graphene surfaces for the same amount of metal evaporation. Generally, metals interact only weakly with graphene as they are not observed on clean (residue free) parts and are mainly clustered. On the other hand, graphene etching has been observed in the presence of metals. The etching was initiated with graphene vacancy formation as a result of the interaction between metal and carbon atoms on clean graphene. Once a vacancy was created, a hole quickly formed and eventually the graphene layers were destroyed.

Inhibitors of PI3K signalling are entering clinical trials, but the impact of PIKC3A mutation on tumour response has yet to be clarified. This study investigated the potential utility of circulating free DNA (cfDNA) as a source for PIK3CA mutation detection in patients with breast cancer. cfDNA extracted (QIAamp Virus spin kit) from blood and matched archival tumour from 46 patients with metastatic breast cancer and 30 patients with localised, operable breast cancer was assessed for hotspot PIK3CA mutations using Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS()) allele-specific PCR and Scorpion probes. PIK3CA mutations were detected in 13/46 (28%) plasma-derived and 10/46 (21%) serum-derived cfDNA samples from metastatic breast cancer patients. In 41 cases with matched tumour and plasma-derived cfDNA data, concordance (same mutation status in plasma and tumour) was 95%. Where a PIK3CA mutation was present in tumour, the 'pick up' in plasma-derived cfDNA was 80%. PIK3CA mutations were present in tumours from 14/30 (47%) localised breast cancers, but no PIK3CA mutations were detected in matched cfDNA.

  "description" : "In recent years, multiple independent neuroscience investigations have implicated critical roles for the rostral temporal lobe in auditory and visual perception, language, and semantic memory. Although arising in the context of different cognitive functions, most of these suggest that there is a gradual convergence of sensory information in the temporal lobe that culminates in modality- and perceptually invariant representations at the most rostral aspect. Currently, however, too little is known regarding connectivity within the human temporal lobe to be sure of exactly how and where convergence occurs; existing hypotheses are primarily derived on the basis of cross-species generalizations from invasive nonhuman primate studies, the validity of which is unclear, especially where language function is concerned. In this study, we map the connectivity of the human rostral temporal lobe in vivo for the first time using diffusion-weighted imaging probabilistic tractography. The results indicate that convergence of sensory information in the temporal lobe is in fact a graded process that occurs along both its longitudinal and lateral axes and culminates in the most rostral limits. We highlight the consistency of our results with those of prior functional neuroimaging, computational modeling, and patient studies. By going beyond simple fasciculus reconstruction, we systematically explored the connectivity of specific temporal lobe areas to frontal and parietal language regions. In contrast to the graded within-temporal lobe connectivity, this intertemporal connectivity was found to dissociate across caudal, mid, and rostral subregions. Furthermore, we identified a basal rostral temporal region with very limited connectivity to areas outside the temporal lobe, which aligns with recent evidence that this subregion underpins the extraction of modality- and context-invariant semantic representations.",

The assumption, that toxins are equality distributed in body fluid compartments may be wrong, and as such lead to poor removal of toxins by dialysis and their accumulation in compartments such as interstitial or tissue fluid.

This study looked at tissue fluid levels of certain toxins like urea, creatinine, uric acid and phosphate and found them to be different from their blood levels. During dialysis, removal of these toxins from blood was not matched by their removal from tissue fluid, indicating that such toxins may be poorly removed from tissue fluid by dialysis. We measured body fluid volumes in these patients and found that tissue fluid volume was markedly increased, more than 7 times the blood fluid volume in most patients. This means that tissue fluid is a large toxin and fluid reservoir in kidney patients, and that the current blood-based approach to measuring toxins and removing them may be flawed. Extraction of tissue fluid can be quite challenging. We developed microneedles (tiny needles) and showed that these could be used to extract tissue fluid from skin, without causing pain or bleeding. Development of such technology will improve understanding of tissue fluid and perhaps lead to remote monitoring at home, using microneedle patches to extract tissue fluid.

Quantitative phosphoproteomics was performed with iTRAQ™ peptide labelling to discover putative modulated phosphorylation sites.

The effect of genotoxic stress on the THO complex protein Thoc5/Fmip was studied using western blots.Results: The expression of BCR/ABL PTK induced γH2AX phosphorylation after etoposide exposure. This was associated with the modulation of H2AX tyrosine 142 phosphorylation, MDC1 (serines 595 and 1053) and Hemogen serine 380 phosphorylation among proteins regulated by both BCR/ABL PTK and etoposide. We identified that leukaemogenic PTKs mediate Thoc5/Fmip phosphorylation on tyrosine 225 via Src proto-oncogene and oxidative stress, while ATM and MEK1/2 may control its phosphorylation.

  "description" : "We report the discovery of two millisecond pulsars in a search for radiopulsations at the positions of Fermi-Large Area Telescope sources withno previously known counterparts, using the Nan{\\c c}ay RadioTelescope. The two millisecond pulsars, PSRs J2017+0603 and J2302+4442,have rotational periods of 2.896 and 5.192 ms and are both in binarysystems with low-eccentricity orbits and orbital periods of 2.2 and125.9 days, respectively, suggesting long recycling processes. Gamma-raypulsations were subsequently detected for both objects, indicating thatthey power the associated Fermi sources in which they were found. Thegamma-ray light curves and spectral properties are similar to those ofpreviously detected gamma-ray millisecond pulsars. Detailed modeling ofthe observed radio and gamma-ray light curves shows that the gamma-rayemission seems to originate at high altitudes in their magnetospheres.Additionally, X-ray observations revealed the presence of an X-raysource at the position of PSR J2302+4442, consistent with thermalemission from a neutron star. These discoveries along with the numerousdetections of radio-loud millisecond pulsars in gamma rays suggest thatmany Fermi sources with no known counterpart could be unknownmillisecond pulsars.",

  "description" : "Altered divalent cation homeostasis with bone mineral loss, hypercalciuria, and hypomagnesemia have been associated consistently with human diabetes mellitus. This study investigated functional, molecular, and biochemical determinants that accompany this condition in chronically (2 wk) streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats. Catheterized, conscious, diabetic rats on servo-controlled fluid replacement exhibited an increased GFR (+70%) and a substantially raised urinary calcium output (+568%) when compared with control rats. In addition, fractional calcium reabsorption was reduced, indicating that the hypercalciuria was not due solely to an osmotic effect but may involve an actual tubular defect. The expression of proteins involved in renal distal Ca2+ and water transport in STZ-diabetic rats were then studied by Western analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy to investigate the molecular basis of the hypercalciuria. Extracellular Ca2+-sensing receptor abundance was reduced to 52% of control in STZ-diabetes, whereas thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter expression was increased by 192%. Subcutaneous insulin implant rectified both functional and molecular parameters. The levels of calbindin D(28k), plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase, and aquaporin 1 in whole kidney and of aquaporin 2 in inner medulla were unchanged in diabetic and/or insulin replacement. Blood levels of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) were reduced in diabetes as were levels of osteocalcin, a marker of bone formation. It is concluded that diabetic hypercalciuria in rats involves elevated GFR with raised urinary output, reduced Ca2+ reabsorption, and impaired bone deposition.

  "description" : "AIMS: One form of the short QT syndrome (SQT3) has been linked to the D172N gain-in-function mutation to Kir2.1, which preferentially increases outward current through channels responsible for inward rectifier K(+) current (I(K1)). This study investigated mechanisms by which the Kir2.1 D172N mutation facilitates and perpetuates ventricular arrhythmias. METHODS AND RESULTS: The ten Tusscher et al. model for human ventricular action potentials (APs) was modified to incorporate changes to I(K1) based on experimentally observed changes to Kir2.1 function: both heterozygous (WT-D172N) and homozygous (D172N) mutant scenarios were studied. Cell models were incorporated into heterogeneous one-dimensional (1D), 2D tissue, and 3D models to compute the restitution curves of AP duration (APD-R), effective refractory period (ERP-R), and conduction velocity (CV). Temporal and spatial vulnerability of ventricular tissue to re-entry was measured and dynamic behaviour of re-entrant excitation waves (lifespan and dominant frequency) in 2D and 3D models of the human ventricle was characterized. D172N 'mutant' I(K1) led to abbreviated APD and ERP, as well as steeper APD-R and ERP-R curves. It reduced tissue excitability at low excitation rates but increased it at high rates. It increased tissue temporal vulnerability for initiating re-entry, but reduced the minimal substrate size necessary to sustain re-entry. SQT3 'mutant' I(K1) also stabilized and accelerated re-entrant excitation waves, leading to sustained rapid re-entry. CONCLUSION: Increased I(K1) due to the Kir2.1 D172N mutation increases arrhythmia risk due to increased tissue vulnerability, shortened ERP, and altered excitability, which in combination facilitate initiation and maintenance of re-entrant circuits.",

  "description" : "Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and their metabolites are ubiquitous in the environment and their occurrence in the aquatic environment is of growing concern. However, despite the fact that these may cause harmful effects in organisms found within this niche, little is currently known about the effects of APIs in the aquatic environment. Chiral pharmaceuticals are of particular concern as the enantiomers may be metabolised differently, with the potential for the production of an array of harmful compounds. There are many racemic APIs for treating human and animal conditions, and even in these target organisms the pharmacodynamic effects of the enantiomers are not always known. Within recent years the importance of the interactions of these compounds within the aquatic environment has been realised and information regarding the fate and biodegradation of such environmental pollutants is of great importance. The advent of post-genomic technologies has proved advantageous in the study of the effects of these environmental pollutants. In this thesis, the effects of a range of chiral APIs, and other environmental pollutants, on environmentally relevant microorganisms were investigated at the metabolome level. The effects of chiral APIs were investigated in a number of prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems in order to provide a comprehensive study of the effects of the APIs in the aquatic environment. FT-IR spectroscopy was employed for metabolic fingerprinting of some environmentally relevant bacteria and GC-MS was subsequently employed for metabolite profiling of two pseudomonads that had shown differential chiral effects with Propranolol. In addition, FT-IR microspectroscopy was employed for the investigation of the phenotypic and localised effects of chiral APIs in a eukaryotic system. Furthermore, the effects of a range of environmental pollutants on a complex bacterial community were investigated with the use of FT-IR spectroscopy and multivariate analysis. Initial results indicated a large phenotypic response in relation to phenol, and this was further explored with a range of ageing experiments and metabolic fingerprinting. An FT-IR peak was found to be characteristic of the phenotypic changes in the actively degrading communities and this was likely to be a degradation product of phenol, and armed with this knowledge the activated sludge community was monitored during the active degradation of phenol with the use of GC-MS.The work presented in this thesis has shown for the first time that metabolomics allows subtle phenotypes in microorganisms to be revealed when they are exposed to chiral forms of APIs which are commonly found in the aquatic environment. Despite these APIs not being designed for any interaction with bacteria and aquatic life in general these are significant findings and may have implications as more and more APIs become detectable and concentrated in the environment due to continued use in man and indeed animals or aquaculture.",

  "description" : "The typical view in evolutionary biology is that mutation rates are minimised. Contrary to that view, studies in combinatorial optimisation and search have shown a clear advantage of using variable mutation rates as a control parameter to optimise the performance of evolutionary algorithms. Ronald Fisher’s work is the basis of much biological theory in this area. He used Euclidean geometry of continuous, infinite phenotypic spaces to study the relation between mutation size and expected fitness of the offspring. Here we develop a general theory of optimal mutation rate control that is based on the alternative geometry of discrete and finite spaces of DNA sequences. We define the monotonic properties of fitness landscapes, which allows us to relate fitness to the topology of genotypes and mutation size. First, we consider the case of a perfectly monotonic fitness landscape, in which the optimal mutation rate control functions can be derived exactly or approximately depending on additional constraints of the problem. Then we consider the general case of non-monotonic landscapes. We use the ideas of local and weak monotonicity to show that optimal mutation rate control functions exist in any such landscape and that they resemble control functions in a monotonic landscape at least in some neighbourhood of a fitness maximum. Generally, optimal mutation rates increase when fitness decreases, and the increase of mutation rate is more rapid in landscapes that are less monotonic (more rugged). We demonstrate these relationships by obtaining and analysing approximately optimal mutation rate control functions in 115 complete landscapes of bind- ing scores between DNA sequences and transcription factors. We discuss the relevance of these findings to living organisms, including the phenomenon of stress-induced mutagenesis.",

  "description" : "Phytochromes are dimeric photoreceptors that regulate a range of responses in plants and microorganisms through interconversion of red light-absorbing (Pr) and far-red light-absorbing (Pfr) states. Photoconversion between these states is initiated by light-driven isomerization of a bilin cofactor, which triggers protein structural change. The extent of this change, and how light-driven structural changes in the N-terminal photosensory region are transmitted to the C-terminal regulatory domain to initiate the signalling cascade, is unknown. We have used pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR) spectroscopy to identify multiple structural transitions in a phytochrome from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (Cph1) by measuring distances between nitroxide labels introduced into the protein. We show that monomers in the Cph1 dimer are aligned in a parallel 'head-to-head' arrangement and that photoconversion between the Pr and Pfr forms involves conformational change in both the N- and C-terminal domains of the protein. Cryo-trapping and kinetic measurements were used to probe the extent and temporal properties of protein motions for individual steps during photoconversion of Cph1. Formation of the primary photoproduct Lumi-R is not affected by changes in solvent viscosity and dielectric constant. Lumi-R formation occurs at cryogenic temperatures, consistent with their being no major structural reorganization of Cph1 during primary photoproduct formation. All remaining steps in the formation of the Pfr state are affected by solvent viscosity and dielectric constant and occur only at elevated temperatures, implying involvement of a series of long-range solvent-coupled conformational changes in Cph1. We show that signalling is achieved through ultrafast photoisomerization where localized structural change in the GAF domain is transmitted and amplified to cause larger-scale and slower conformational change in the PHY and histidine kinase domains. This hierarchy of timescales and extent of structural change orientates the histidine kinase domain to elicit the desired light-activated biological response.",

  "description" : "Here we present a protocol, which allows loss-of-function studies in Xenopus embryos using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs). Gene knockdown studies provide a critical method for assessing gene function in vitro and in vivo. Such studies are currently performed in Xenopus using primarily one of the two main methods: (1) overexpression of dominant negative constructs or (2) inhibition of gene function by using MOs targeting either the initiation of translation or mRNA splicing. While a dominant negative approach is very effective, it often suffers from specificity. Given that MOs target very specific nucleotide sequences in the target RNA, it suffers considerably less from issues of specificity. The most convenient method for introducing MOs into embryos is through microinjection, which is a simple procedure. Therefore, a reverse genetics approach in Xenopus using MOs is an extremely powerful tool to study gene function, particularly when taking advantage of available sequence data in the post-genomic era. Furthermore, given the well-established fate map in Xenopus, it is also very easy to generate mosaic knockdown embryos, where the gene of interest is affected in defined regions of the embryo. Finally it should be noted that MOs can also be used to block miRNA function and processing, so that it provides a convenient method to not only perform gene knockdown studies on protein coding genes, but also noncoding genes.

The problems are hence underdetermined and are often ill-posed. We study these problems from the viewpoint of Bayesian statistics, with the resulting posterior probability measure being defined on a space of functions. We develop an abstract framework for such problems which facilitates application of an infinite-dimensional version of Bayes theorem, leads to a well-posedness result for the posterior measure (continuity in a suitable probability metric with respect to changes in data), and also leads to a theory for the existence of maximizing the posterior probability (MAP) estimators for such Bayesian inverse problems on function space. A central idea underlying these results is that continuity properties and bounds on the forward model guide the choice of the prior measure for the inverse problem , leading to the desired results on well-posedness and MAP estimators; the PDE analysis and probability theory required are thus clearly dileneated, allowing a straightforward derivation of results. We show that the abstract theory applies to some concrete applications of interest by studying problems arising from data assimilation in fluid mechanics. The objective is to make inference about the underlying velocity field, on the basis of either Eulerian or Lagrangian observations. We study problems without model error, in which case the inference is on the initial condition, and problems with model error in which case the inference is on the initial condition and on the driving noise process or, equivalently, on the entire time-dependent velocity field.

Simultaneous stimulation of schistosome-exposed C57BL/6 dendritic cells with a heat-killed bacterium enabled these cells to overcome IL-10 regulation and induce IL-17, even in wild-type C57BL/6 recipients. This schistosome-specific IL-17 was dependent on IL-6 production by the copulsed dendritic cells. Coimmunization of C57BL/6 animals with bacterial and schistosome Ags also resulted in schistosome-specific IL-17, and this response was enhanced in the absence of IL-10-mediated immune regulation.

  "description" : "Caveolin-1 (CAV1) is the main structural component of caveolae, which are plasma membrane invaginations that participate in vesicular trafficking and signal transduction events. Although evidence describing the function of CAV1 in several cancer types has recently accumulated, its role in melanoma tumor formation and progression remains poorly explored. Here, by using B16F10 melanoma cells as an experimental system, we directly explore the function of CAV1 in melanoma tumor growth and metastasis. We first show that CAV1 expression promotes proliferation, whereas it suppresses migration and invasion of B16F10 cells in vitro. When orthotopically implanted in the skin of mice, B16F10 cells expressing CAV1 form tumors that are similar in size to their control counterparts. An experimental metastasis assay shows that CAV1 expression suppresses the ability of B16F10 cells to form lung metastases in C57Bl/6 syngeneic mice. Additionally, CAV1 protein and mRNA levels are found to be significantly reduced in human metastatic melanoma cell lines and human tissue from metastatic lesions. Finally, we show that following integrin activation, B16F10 cells expressing CAV1 display reduced expression levels and activity of FAK and Src proteins. Furthermore, CAV1 expression markedly reduces the expression of integrin β(3) in B16F10 melanoma cells. In summary, our findings provide experimental evidence that CAV1 may function as an antimetastatic gene in malignant melanoma.",

When orthotopically implanted in the skin of mice, B16F10 cells expressing CAV1 form tumors that are similar in size to their control counterparts. An experimental metastasis assay shows that CAV1 expression suppresses the ability of B16F10 cells to form lung metastases in C57Bl/6 syngeneic mice. Additionally, CAV1 protein and mRNA levels are found to be significantly reduced in human metastatic melanoma cell lines and human tissue from metastatic lesions. Finally, we show that following integrin activation, B16F10 cells expressing CAV1 display reduced expression levels and activity of FAK and Src proteins. Furthermore, CAV1 expression markedly reduces the expression of integrin β(3) in B16F10 melanoma cells. In summary, our findings provide experimental evidence that CAV1 may function as an antimetastatic gene in malignant melanoma.", null ],

  "description" : "Background: During the lifetime of a fermenter culture, the soil bacterium S. coelicolor undergoes a major metabolic switch from exponential growth to antibiotic production. We have studied gene expression patterns during this switch, using a specifically designed Affymetrix genechip and a high-resolution time-series of fermenter-grown samples.Results: Surprisingly, we find that the metabolic switch actually consists of multiple finely orchestrated switching events. Strongly coherent clusters of genes show drastic changes in gene expression already many hours before the classically defined transition phase where the switch from primary to secondary metabolism was expected. The main switch in gene expression takes only 2 hours, and changes in antibiotic biosynthesis genes are delayed relative to the metabolic rearrangements. Furthermore, global variation in morphogenesis genes indicates an involvement of cell differentiation pathways in the decision phase leading up to the commitment to antibiotic biosynthesis.Conclusions: Our study provides the first detailed insights into the complex sequence of early regulatory events during and preceding the major metabolic switch in S. coelicolor, which will form the starting point for future attempts at engineering antibiotic production in a biotechnological setting. ?? 2010 Nieselt et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",

The authors hypothesised that polymorphisms in genes whose expression were altered by gastroenteritis might be linked to IBS with diarrhoea (IBS-D) which closely resembles PI-IBS. DESIGN: Part 1: 25 healthy volunteers (HVs), 21 patients 6 months after Campylobacter jejuni infection, 37 IBS-D and 19 IBS with constipation (IBS-C) underwent rectal biopsy for gene expression analysis and peripheral blood mononuclear cell cytokine production assessment. Part 2: Polymorphisms in genes whose expression was altered in Part 1 were assessed in 179 HV, 179 IBS-D, 122 IBS-C and 41 PI-IBS. RESULTS: Part 1: Mucosal expression of seven genes was altered in IBS: CCL11, CCL13, Calpain 8 and TNFSF15 increased while NR1D1, GPR161 and GABRE decreased with similar patterns after infection with C jejuni. Part 2: The authors assessed 21 known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these seven genes and one SNP in each of the TNFα and IL-10 genes.

  "title" : "Ketones and lactate increase cancer cell \"stemness,\" driving recurrence, metastasis, and poor clinical outcome in breast cancer: Achieving personalized medicine via Metabolo-Genomics.",
  "description" : "Previously, we showed that high-energy metabolites (lactate and ketones) \"fuel\" tumor growth and experimental metastasis in an in vivo xenograft model, most likely by driving oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in breast cancer cells. To mechanistically understand how these metabolites affect tumor cell behavior, here we used genome-wide transcriptional profiling. Briefly, human breast cancer cells (MCF7) were cultured with lactate or ketones, and then subjected to transcriptional analysis (exon-array). Interestingly, our results show that treatment with these high-energy metabolites increases the transcriptional expression of gene profiles normally associated with \"stemness,\" including genes upregulated in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Similarly, we observe that lactate and ketones promote the growth of bonafide ES cells, providing functional validation. The lactate- and ketone-induced \"gene signatures\" were able to predict poor clinical outcome (including recurrence and metastasis) in a cohort of human breast cancer patients. Taken together, our results are consistent with the idea that lactate and ketone utilization in cancer cells promotes the \"cancer stem cell\" phenotype, resulting in significant decreases in patient survival. One possible mechanism by which these high-energy metabolites might induce stemness is by increasing the pool of Acetyl-CoA, leading to increased histone acetylation, and elevated gene expression. Thus, our results mechanistically imply that clinical outcome in breast cancer could simply be determined by epigenetics and energy metabolism, rather than by the accumulation of specific \"classical\" gene mutations. We also suggest that high-risk cancer patients (identified by the lactate/ketone gene signatures) could be treated with new therapeutics that target oxidative mitochondrial metabolism, such as the anti-oxidant and \"mitochondrial poison\" metformin. Finally, we propose that this new approach to personalized cancer medicine be termed \"Metabolo-Genomics,\" which incorporates features of both 1) cell metabolism and 2) gene transcriptional profiling. Importantly, this powerful new approach directly links cancer cell metabolism with clinical outcome, and new therapeutic strategies for inhibiting the TCA cycle and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in cancer cells.",

Similarly, we observe that lactate and ketones promote the growth of bonafide ES cells, providing functional validation. The lactate- and ketone-induced \"gene signatures\" were able to predict poor clinical outcome (including recurrence and metastasis) in a cohort of human breast cancer patients. Taken together, our results are consistent with the idea that lactate and ketone utilization in cancer cells promotes the \"cancer stem cell\" phenotype, resulting in significant decreases in patient survival. One possible mechanism by which these high-energy metabolites might induce stemness is by increasing the pool of Acetyl-CoA, leading to increased histone acetylation, and elevated gene expression. Thus, our results mechanistically imply that clinical outcome in breast cancer could simply be determined by epigenetics and energy metabolism, rather than by the accumulation of specific \"classical\" gene mutations. We also suggest that high-risk cancer patients (identified by the lactate/ketone gene signatures) could be treated with new therapeutics that target oxidative mitochondrial metabolism, such as the anti-oxidant and \"mitochondrial poison\" metformin. Finally, we propose that this new approach to personalized cancer medicine be termed \"Metabolo-Genomics,\" which incorporates features of both 1) cell metabolism and 2) gene transcriptional profiling. Importantly, this powerful new approach directly links cancer cell metabolism with clinical outcome, and new therapeutic strategies for inhibiting the TCA cycle and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in cancer cells.", null ],

To mechanistically understand how these metabolites affect tumor cell behavior, here we used genome-wide transcriptional profiling. Briefly, human breast cancer cells (MCF7) were cultured with lactate or ketones, and then subjected to transcriptional analysis (exon-array). Interestingly, our results show that treatment with these high-energy metabolites increases the transcriptional expression of gene profiles normally associated with \"stemness,\" including genes upregulated in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Similarly, we observe that lactate and ketones promote the growth of bonafide ES cells, providing functional validation. The lactate- and ketone-induced \"gene signatures\" were able to predict poor clinical outcome (including recurrence and metastasis) in a cohort of human breast cancer patients. Taken together, our results are consistent with the idea that lactate and ketone utilization in cancer cells promotes the \"cancer stem cell\" phenotype, resulting in significant decreases in patient survival. One possible mechanism by which these high-energy metabolites might induce stemness is by increasing the pool of Acetyl-CoA, leading to increased histone acetylation, and elevated gene expression. Thus, our results mechanistically imply that clinical outcome in breast cancer could simply be determined by epigenetics and energy metabolism, rather than by the accumulation of specific \"classical\" gene mutations. We also suggest that high-risk cancer patients (identified by the lactate/ketone gene signatures) could be treated with new therapeutics that target oxidative mitochondrial metabolism, such as the anti-oxidant and \"mitochondrial poison\" metformin. Finally, we propose that this new approach to personalized cancer medicine be termed \"Metabolo-Genomics,\" which incorporates features of both 1) cell metabolism and 2) gene transcriptional profiling.

  "description" : "OBJECTIVES: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with accelerated atherosclerosis and premature cardiovascular death. Anti-TNF therapy is thought to reduce clinical cardiovascular disease risk and improve vascular function in RA patients. However, the specific effects of TNF inhibitors on endothelial cell function are largely unknown. Our aim was to explore the effects of certolizumab pegol (CZP) on TNF-activated human aortic endothelial cells (HAoECs). METHODS: HAoECs were cultured in vitro and exposed to i) TNF alone, ii) TNF plus CZP, or iii) neither agent. Microarray analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to analyse gene expression. Activation of NF-κB was investigated using immunocytochemistry, high content analysis and western blotting. Flow cytometry was performed to detect microparticle release from HAoECs. RESULTS: TNF alone had strong effects on endothelial gene expression, while TNF and CZP together produced a global gene expression pattern similar to untreated controls. In particular, genes for E-selectin, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 were significantly up-regulated by TNF treatment. Notably, the TNF/CZP cocktail prevented the up-regulation of these genes. TNF-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB was abolished by treatment with CZP. In addition the increased production of endothelial microparticles in TNF-activated HAoECs was prevented by treatment with CZP. CONCLUSIONS: We have found at cellular level, that a clinically available TNF inhibitor, CZP i) reduces adhesion molecule expression; ii) prevents TNF-induced activation of the NF-κB pathway and iii) prevents the production of microparticles by activated endothelial cells. This could be central to the prevention of inflammatory environments underlying these conditions.",

  "title" : "Development of a Finite Element Model for the Study of Tendon Repair Techniques",
  "description" : "Over 30,000 people suffer tendon injury in the UK per annum and over two thirds of these are hand tendon injuries. Hand tendon lacerations are notoriously difficult to treat and 25% of patients achieve an unsatisfactory clinical outcome as assessed by the clinician. Tendons are commonly repaired using suture, with many different suture configurations described in the literature for tendon repair. Despite many in vivo clinical studies and ex vivo tensile tests, many different repair techniques are employed in the clinical setting, demonstrating that there is not currently a best practice method of repairing ruptured tendons. Direct comparison between all repair methods, along with detailed observations of localised high stress and deformation would be valuable in determining a best practice repair method. This information can be obtained by the use of finite element analysis. The aim of this work was to produce a finite element model of suture repaired tendon suitable for comparing different suturing methods. This work has also focussed on describing the mechanical characteristics of tendon tissue for use in the suture repair finite element model. Whilst the longitudinal Young’s modulus of tendon is well documented, the transverse tendon properties have received little attention. Porcine tendon samples were tested in tension transverse to the fibril direction. Stress and strain were observed during tensile testing to determine the transverse Young’s modulus. From the transverse Young’s modulus, the Young’s modulus of tendon interfibrillar material was deduced. This informed a micro-scale finite element model of tendon tissue. In constructing the micro-scale model, the fibrils and inter-fibrillar material were likened to a continuous fibre reinforced composite material and a simplified model of tendon microstructure was produced. Homogenisation was performed on the micro-scale model to obtain a homogeneous material description which represented tendon microstructure’s mechanical behaviour. Finally, this homogeneous material description was used to describe tendon in the macro-scale finite element model of a suture repaired tendon. Force was applied to the suture repair finite element model, and model deformation was compared with deformation observed in sutured ex vivo porcine tendon samples.Tensile testing results yielded that the transverse Young’s modulus of tendon ranges from 0.1035 ±0.0454 MPa to 0.2551 ±0.0818 MPa. The Young’s modulus of the interfibrillar material was found to range from 0.0416 MPa to 0.1021 MPa. Deformation of the suture repair model correlated poorly with ex vivo laboratory results when using the mechanical properties obtained from the micro-scale model to describe tendon behaviour. The microstructure model considers tendon fibrils and surrounding tissue as a fibre reinforced composite material. Our results suggest that a more complex representation of tendon microstructure is required to sufficiently define tendon mechanical properties for use in a suture repair model. The description of tendon which provided closest agreement with experimental results in the macro-scale model was an orthotropic linear elastic material with a Young’s modulus of 200MPa and a Poisson’s ratio of 0.4. A linear elastic description of tendon permitted analysis of suture repairs at low forces. To obtain data for forces over 0.1N, development of a hyperelastic description of tendon is recommended.

  "title" : "Thermodynamics of Biomacromolecular Interactions in Aqueous Solutions",
  "description" : "An understanding of the interactions between polyelectrolytes and proteins is vital to determine structure and functionality of materials constructed of these two components. Possible applications for the protein-polyelectrolyte composites are ranging from materials used to deliver drugs to the methods of protein stabilisation for storage of therapeutics, biosemsors, and encapsulation of medicines for triggered release. The binding of globular proteins to the polyelectrolyte chains can prevent undesired protein aggregation and may help to extend the shelf-life of the protein-containing food. The aim of this project is to study the mechanism of non-covalent binding between proteins and polyelectrolytes, responsiveness of the proteinpolyelectrolyte composites to external stimuli such as changing pH, presence of salt of different types and concentrations or influence of enzyme on the integrity of protein-polyelectrolyte multilayer film.Our study was focused on the effects of different mono- and multivalent salts on binding affinitybetween a negatively charged polyelectrolyte - poly(styrene sulfonate) PSS and bovine serumalbumin BSA or myoglobin. The complex formation between these polymers was examinedusing the static light scattering (SLS), turbidimetric and potentiometric titrations, differentialscanning calorimetry (DSC) and theoretical studies based on molecular dynamics simulations. We established that the inter- and intramolecular interactions between proteins and polyelectrolytes are primarily driven by the electrostatic forces at the conditions when thepolymers are in low ionic strength solutions and attractive or repulsive relations are based upon the charge density and its distribution. When proteins are interacting with polyelectrolytes in solutions of high ionic strength the electrostatic interactions are screened by the salt originated co-ions. In these conditions there is a competition between salting-out effect on proteins leading to protein aggregation or protein-polyelectrolyte complex formation, which can prevent undesired protein-protein association.

We examined the process of ageing of fibroin solutions and solid-liquid transformations taking place within the fluid. The transitions between viscous and elastic behaviour of the fibroin’s semi-dilute solutions were initiated by strain, shear frequency and temperature.

  "texts" : [ "Thermodynamics of Biomacromolecular Interactions in Aqueous Solutions", "An understanding of the interactions between polyelectrolytes and proteins is vital to determine structure and functionality of materials constructed of these two components. Possible applications for the protein-polyelectrolyte composites are ranging from materials used to deliver drugs to the methods of protein stabilisation for storage of therapeutics, biosemsors, and encapsulation of medicines for triggered release. The binding of globular proteins to the polyelectrolyte chains can prevent undesired protein aggregation and may help to extend the shelf-life of the protein-containing food. The aim of this project is to study the mechanism of non-covalent binding between proteins and polyelectrolytes, responsiveness of the proteinpolyelectrolyte composites to external stimuli such as changing pH, presence of salt of different types and concentrations or influence of enzyme on the integrity of protein-polyelectrolyte multilayer film.Our study was focused on the effects of different mono- and multivalent salts on binding affinitybetween a negatively charged polyelectrolyte - poly(styrene sulfonate) PSS and bovine serumalbumin BSA or myoglobin. The complex formation between these polymers was examinedusing the static light scattering (SLS), turbidimetric and potentiometric titrations, differentialscanning calorimetry (DSC) and theoretical studies based on molecular dynamics simulations. We established that the inter- and intramolecular interactions between proteins and polyelectrolytes are primarily driven by the electrostatic forces at the conditions when thepolymers are in low ionic strength solutions and attractive or repulsive relations are based upon the charge density and its distribution. When proteins are interacting with polyelectrolytes in solutions of high ionic strength the electrostatic interactions are screened by the salt originated co-ions. In these conditions there is a competition between salting-out effect on proteins leading to protein aggregation or protein-polyelectrolyte complex formation, which can prevent undesired protein-protein association. The forces driving the attractive interactions at high ionic strength are of non-electrostatic origin, these are mainly hydrophobic forces. The computer simulation study shows that more flexible polyanionic chains are stronger binders to the positive patches on protein surface than these of a more rigid backbone.

  "description" : "Abnormal fibroblasts have been implicated in keloid formation, a benign but fibroproliferative skin disorder. However, the exact source of these cells remains unknown. Fibrocytes are considered to be hybrid mesenchymal/hematopoietic cells, having been identified in various fibrotic disorders as the precursors of fibroblasts.

We compared the proportion of MSCs in keloid versus bone marrow-derived cells and compared fibrocytes in keloid as opposed to normal scar tissue. We also investigated the propagation of fibrocytes in serum-supplemented versus serum-free media. Using multicolor fluorescence-activated cell analysis, we found distinct populations of MSCs (CD34(-)CD73(+)CD90(+)CD105(+)) that were different from CD45RO(+)25F9(+)MRP8/14(+) fibrocytes present in keloid tissue, while very few fibrocytes were observed in normal scar tissue. The proportion of keloid-derived cells in serum-free or serum-supplemented cultures expressing these fibrocyte markers was greater than from cultures derived from normal scar tissue (p < 0.05). We found that the proliferation of CD45(+)/Col1(+) keloid cells in vitro was greater in serum-free media compared to serum-supplemented media. This is the first study to have identified fibrocytes isolated from keloid tissue and normal scars, utilizing a specific set of markers for fibrocytes. This finding may aid our understanding of the origin of abnormal fibroblasts identified in keloid scarring.

  "description" : "Tissue stem cells and germ line or embryonic stem cells were shown to have reduced oxidative metabolism, which was proposed to be an adaptive mechanism to reduce damage accumulation caused by reactive oxygen species. However, an alternate explanation is that stem cells are less dependent on specialized cytoplasmic functions compared with differentiated cells, therefore, having a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic volume ratio and consequently a low mitochondrial content. To determine whether stem cells rely or not on mitochondrial respiration, we selectively ablated the electron transport chain in the basal layer of the epidermis, which includes the epidermal progenitor/stem cells (EPSCs). This was achieved using a loxP-flanked mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) allele in conjunction with a keratin 14 Cre transgene. The epidermis of these animals (Tfam(EKO)) showed a profound depletion of mitochondrial DNA and complete absence of respiratory chain complexes. However, despite a short lifespan due to malnutrition, epidermal development and skin barrier function were not impaired. Differentiation of epidermal layers was normal and no proliferation defect or major increase of apoptosis could be observed. In contrast, mice with an epidermal ablation of prohibitin-2, a scaffold protein in the inner mitochondrial membrane, displayed a dramatic phenotype observable already in utero, with severely impaired skin architecture and barrier function, ultimately causing death from dehydration shortly after birth.

  "description" : "Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from pluripotent early epiblast contribute functionally differentiated progeny to all foetal lineages of chimaeras. By contrast, epistem cell (EpiSC) lines from post-implantation epithelialised epiblast are unable to colonise the embryo even though they express the core pluripotency genes Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog. We examined interconversion between these two cell types. ES cells can readily become EpiSCs in response to growth factor cues. By contrast, EpiSCs do not change into ES cells. We exploited PiggyBac transposition to introduce a single reprogramming factor, Klf4, into EpiSCs. No effect was apparent in EpiSC culture conditions, but in ground state ES cell conditions a fraction of cells formed undifferentiated colonies. These EpiSC-derived induced pluripotent stem (Epi-iPS) cells activated expression of ES cell-specific transcripts including endogenous Klf4, and downregulated markers of lineage specification. X chromosome silencing in female cells, a feature of the EpiSC state, was erased in Epi-iPS cells. They produced high-contribution chimaeras that yielded germline transmission. These properties were maintained after Cre-mediated deletion of the Klf4 transgene, formally demonstrating complete and stable reprogramming of developmental phenotype. Thus, re-expression of Klf4 in an appropriate environment can regenerate the naïve ground state from EpiSCs. Reprogramming is dependent on suppression of extrinsic growth factor stimuli and proceeds to completion in less than 1% of cells. This substantiates the argument that EpiSCs are developmentally, epigenetically and functionally differentiated from ES cells. However, because a single transgene is the minimum requirement to attain the ground state, EpiSCs offer an attractive opportunity for screening for unknown components of the reprogramming process.",

  "title" : "The lofting of Western Pacific regional aerosol by island thermodynamics as observed around Borneo",
  "description" : "Vertical profiles of aerosol chemical composition, number concentration and size were measured throughout the lower troposphere of Borneo, a large tropical island in the western Pacific Ocean. Aerosol composition, size and number concentration measurements (using an Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer, Passive Cavity Aerosol Spectrometer Probe and Condensation Particle Counter, respectively) were made both upwind and downwind of Borneo, as well as over the island itself, on board the UK BAe-146 research aircraft as part of the OP3 project. Two meteorological regimes were identified - one dominated by isolated terrestrial convection (ITC) which peaked in the afternoon, and the other characterised by more regionally active mesoscale convective systems (MCS). Upwind profiles show aerosol to be confined to a shallow marine boundary layer below 930 +/- 10 hPa (similar to 760 m above sea level, a.s.l.). As this air mass advects over the island with the mean free troposphere synoptic flow during the ITC-dominated regime, it is convectively lofted above the terrestrial surface mixed layer to heights of between 945 +/- 22 (similar to 630 m a.s.l.) and 740 +/- 44 hPa (similar to 2740 m a.s.l.), consistent with a coupling between the synoptic steering level flow and island sea breeze circulations. Terrestrial aerosol was observed to be lofted into this higher layer through both moist convective uplift and transport through turbulent diurnal sea-breeze cells. At the peak of convective activity in the mid-afternoons, organic aerosol loadings in the lofted layer were observed to be substantially higher than in the morning (by a mean factor of three). This organic matter is dominated by secondary aerosol from processing of biogenic gas phase precursors. Aerosol number concentration profiles suggest formation of new particles aloft in the atmosphere. By the time the air mass reaches the west coast of the island, terrestrial aerosol is enhanced in the lofted layer. Such uplift of aerosol in Borneo is expected to increase aerosol lifetimes in the lower free troposphere downwind, as they are above the boundary layer and therefore less likely to be lost by wet or dry deposition. It is also likely to change the role they play in the semi-direct and direct aerosol effects. The long chain of islands extending from Malaysia to Australia may all similarly be expected to present an orographic barrier to low level mean flow. This would lead to significant transport of aerosol into the tropical free troposphere across the Western Pacific region.",

  "description" : "Exceptional preservation of soft-bodied Cambrian chordates provides our only direct information on the origin of vertebrates. Fossil chordates from this interval offer crucial insights into how the distinctive body plan of vertebrates evolved, but reading this pre-biomineralization fossil record is fraught with difficulties, leading to controversial and contradictory interpretations. The cause of these difficulties is taphonomic: we lack data on when and how important characters change as they decompose, resulting in a lack of constraint on anatomical interpretation and a failure to distinguish phylogenetic absence of characters from loss through decay. Here we show, from experimental decay of amphioxus and ammocoetes, that loss of chordate characters during decay is non-random: the more phylogenetically informative are the most labile, whereas plesiomorphic characters are decay resistant. The taphonomic loss of synapomorphies and relatively higher preservation potential of chordate plesiomorphies will thus result in bias towards wrongly placing fossils on the chordate stem. Application of these data to Cathaymyrus (Cambrian period of China) and Metaspriggina (Cambrian period of Canada) highlights the difficulties: these fossils cannot be placed reliably in the chordate or vertebrate stem because they could represent the decayed remains of any non-biomineralized, total-group chordate. Preliminary data suggest that this decay filter also affects other groups of organisms and that 'stem-ward slippage' may be a widespread but currently unrecognized bias in our understanding of the early evolution of a number of phyla.",

  "description" : "Here, we investigated the compartment-specific role of cell cycle arrest and senescence in breast cancer tumor growth. For this purpose, we generated a number of hTERT-immortalized senescent fibroblast cell lines overexpressing CDK inhibitors, such as p16(INK4A), p19(ARF) or p21(WAF1/CIP1). Interestingly, all these senescent fibroblast cell lines showed evidence of increased susceptibility toward the induction of autophagy (either at baseline or after starvation), as well as significant mitochondrial dysfunction. Most importantly, these senescent fibroblasts also dramatically promoted tumor growth (up to ~2-fold), without any comparable increases in tumor angiogenesis. Conversely, we generated human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 cells) overexpressing CDK inhibitors, namely p16(INK4A) or p21(WAF1/CIP1). Senescent MDA-MB-231 cells also showed increased expression of markers of cell cycle arrest and autophagy, including β-galactosidase, as predicted. Senescent MDA-MB-231 cells had retarded tumor growth, with up to a near 2-fold reduction in tumor volume. Thus, the effects of CDK inhibitors are compartment-specific and are related to their metabolic effects, which results in the induction of autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction. Finally, induction of cell cycle arrest with specific inhibitors (PD0332991) or cellular stressors [hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) or starvation] indicated that the onset of autophagy and senescence are inextricably linked biological processes.

  "description" : "Compton scattering provides important insight into the structure of the nucleon. For photons up to about 300 MeV, it is parameterised by six dynamical dipole polarisabilities which characterise the response of the nucleon to a monochromatic photon of fixed frequency and multipolarity.

Chiral Effective Field Theory (ChiEFT) describes nucleon, deuteron and 3-He Compton scattering, using consistent nuclear currents, rescattering and wave functions. It can thus also be used to extract useful information on the neutron amplitude from Compton scattering on light nuclei. We summarise past work in ChiEFT on all of these reactions and compare with other theoretical approaches. We also discuss all proton experiments up to about 400 MeV, as well as the three modern elastic deuteron data sets, paying particular attention to precision and accuracy of each set. Constraining the Delta(1232) parameters from the resonance region, we then perform new fits to the proton data up to omega(lab)=170 MeV, and a new fit to the deuteron data.

  "description" : "In this paper, to analyze the functional influence of ischemia on cardiac cell electrical activity and subsequently on ventricular electrical wave conduction, a human ventricular ischemic model was developed, which took into account three major pathophysiological components of ischemias hyperkalaemia, acidosis, and anoxia. This model simulated the action potential (AP) propagations of endocardial, midmycardial and epicardial cells with different levels of ischemia, and the influence of each factor on cell AP was analyzed. Finally the ECG waveform under ischemia was quantified by using a 2D model of human left ventricular tissue based on the anatomical structure of human heart. The experimental results showed that under ischemia action potential durations (APD) were reduced.

  "texts" : [ "[Modeling of electrophysiology and simulation of ECG under ischemic condition in human ventricular tissue].", "In this paper, to analyze the functional influence of ischemia on cardiac cell electrical activity and subsequently on ventricular electrical wave conduction, a human ventricular ischemic model was developed, which took into account three major pathophysiological components of ischemias hyperkalaemia, acidosis, and anoxia. This model simulated the action potential (AP) propagations of endocardial, midmycardial and epicardial cells with different levels of ischemia, and the influence of each factor on cell AP was analyzed. Finally the ECG waveform under ischemia was quantified by using a 2D model of human left ventricular tissue based on the anatomical structure of human heart. The experimental results showed that under ischemia action potential durations (APD) were reduced. In most cases, the larger the size of ischemic region or the more severe the ischemic level, the more dramatic the changes in the amplitude of ST-T wave were observed. For the three components of ischemia, hyperkalaemia was the dominant contributor to ST-T wave changes, which was in agreement with the results obtained on animal models.", null ],

In this regard, one group of interesting compounds are enantiopure carboxylic acids as traditional methods towards producing these compounds that rely on a process known as enantioselective decarboxylative protonation (EDP) are often insufficient due to a combination of factors including low yields, low enantioselectivities, the need for environmentally deleterious reaction conditions and high costs.Due to the shortcomings of these synthetic techniques, the application of biological systems is an alternative method that has come to the forefront of current research, which is because biological systems often boast a number of advantages over traditional chemical methods.

This work allows us to see how flexible this method is with regards to theproduction of a range of different carboxylic acid products, which is important as previous chemical methods are often limited by a lack of diversity. It also allows us to see how the kinetic parameters of the enzyme catalysed reactions change dependent on the identity of the substrate, allowing us to better justify the currently proposed mechanism and to better direct attempts to improve the enzyme through mutagenesis experiments.

  "description" : "\"Hypomyelination and Congenital Cataract\", HCC (MIM #610532), is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital cataract and diffuse cerebral and peripheral hypomyelination. HCC is caused by deficiency of Hyccin, a protein whose biological role has not been clarified yet. Since the identification of the cell types expressing a protein of unknown function can contribute to define the physiological context in which the molecule is explicating its function, we analyzed the pattern of Hyccin expression in the central and peripheral nervous system (CNS and PNS). Using heterozygous mice expressing the b-galactosidase (LacZ) gene under control of the Hyccin gene regulatory elements, we show that the gene is primarily expressed in neuronal cells. Indeed, Hyccin-LacZ signal was identified in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons, olfactory bulb, and cortical pyramidal neurons, while it did not colocalize with oligodendroglial or astrocytic markers. In the PNS, Hyccin was detectable only in axons isolated from newborn mice. In the brain, Hyccin transcript levels were higher in early postnatal development (postnatal days 2 and 10) and then declined in adult mice. In a model of active myelinogenesis, organotypic cultures of rat Schwann cells (SC)/Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons, Hyccin was detected along the neurites, while it was absent from SC. Intriguingly, the abundance of the molecule was upregulated at postnatal days 10 and 15, in the initial steps of myelinogenesis and then declined at 30 days when the process is complete. As Hyccin is primarily expressed in neurons and its mutation leads to hypomyelination in human patients, we suggest that the protein is involved in neuron-to-glia signalling to initiate or maintain myelination.",

  "description" : "CD4 T cells are known to assist the CD8 T cell response by activating APC via CD40-CD40 ligand (L) interactions. However, recent data have shown that bacterial products can directly activate APC through Toll-like receptors, resulting in up-regulation of costimulatory molecules necessary for the efficient priming of naive T cells. It remains unclear what role CD4 T cell help and various costimulation pathways play in the development of CD8 T cell responses during bacterial infection. In this study, we examined these questions using an intracellular bacterium, Listeria monocytogenes, as a model of infection. In CD4 T cell-depleted, CD4(-/-), and MHC class II(-/-) mice, L. monocytogenes infection induced CD8 T cell activation and primed epitope-specific CD8 T cells to levels commensurate with those in normal C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, these epitope-specific CD8 T cells established long-term memory in CD4(-/-) mice that was capable of mounting a protective recall response. In vitro analysis showed that L. monocytogenes directly stimulated the activation and maturation of murine dendritic cells. The CD8 T cell response to L. monocytogenes was normal in CD40L(-/-) mice but defective in CD28(-/-) and CD137L(-/-) mice. These data show that in situations where infectious agents or immunogens can directly activate APC, CD8 T cell responses are less dependent on CD4 T cell help via the CD40-CD40L pathway but involve costimulation through CD137-CD137L and B7-CD28 interactions.",

  "description" : "OBJECTIVE: To screen patients with oligoarticular and polyarticular forms of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) to determine (i) the severity of their class II skeletal pattern; (ii) temporomandibular joint signs and symptoms and (iii) use of systemic corticosteroids. DESIGN: Cross-sectional screening. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Sixty-eight children with JIA aged between 9 and 16 years old who were screened at four regional treatment centres in the UK. METHOD: Patients were screened clinically and radiographically for the presence of class II skeletal pattern and temporomandibular (TMJ) pain dysfunction syndrome. In addition, the JIA sub-type and history of disease activity and medication were recorded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Class II skeletal pattern, TMJ signs and symptoms, use of systemic corticosteroids. RESULTS: The mean ANB values were 4.2 degrees (SD = 2.9 degrees) in the oligoarticular group and 5.1 degrees (SD = 3.8 degrees) in the polyarticular group. Just under one-third of children had a moderate or severe class II skeletal pattern and a further quarter of children had a mild class II skeletal pattern. Clinical signs and symptoms of temporomandibular joint pain dysfunction syndrome were low (<20%), except for crepitus and click which affected between 24 and 40% of JIA children. Radiographically, 57% of oligoarticular and 77% of polyarticular cases exhibited condylar erosion. Use of systemic corticosteroids varied between centres, but overall, was prescribed more in polyarticular cases (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Just under one-third of oligoarticular and polyarticular JIA patients exhibited a moderate or severe class II skeletal pattern. It is, therefore, likely that any future clinical trial to investigate the effect of functional appliance treatment in JIA patients, will need multicentre co-operation to fulfil potential sample size requirements.

  "description" : "The uncertainty in determining the volatility behaviour of organic particles from thermograms using calibration curves and a kinetic model has been evaluated. In the analysis, factors such as re-condensation, departure from equilibrium and analysis methodology were considered as potential sources of uncertainty in deriving volatility distribution from thermograms obtained with currently used thermodenuder designs. The previously found empirical relationship between C{*} (saturation concentration) and T-50 (temperature at which 50\\% of aerosol mass evaporates) was theoretically interpreted and tested to infer volatility distributions from experimental thermograms. The presented theoretical analysis shows that this empirical equation is in fact an equilibrium formulation, whose applicability is lessened as measurements deviate from equilibrium. While using a calibration curve between C{*} and T-50 to estimate volatility properties was found to hold at equilibrium, significant underestimation was obtained under kinetically-controlled evaporation conditions. Because thermograms obtained at ambient aerosol loading levels are most likely to show departure from equilibrium, the application of a kinetic evaporation model is more suitable for inferring volatility properties of atmospheric samples than the calibration curve approach; however, the kinetic model analysis implies significant uncertainty, due to its sensitivity to the assumption of `effective' net kinetic evaporation and condensation coefficients. The influence of re-condensation on thermograms from the thermodenuder designs under study was found to be highly dependent on the particular experimental condition, with a significant potential to affect volatility estimations for aerosol mass loadings > 50 mu g m(-3) and with increasing effective kinetic coefficient for condensation and decreasing particle size. These results show that the geometry of current thermodenuder systems should be modified to prevent re-condensation.",

  "description" : "This study investigated the mechanisms underlying the propagation of cytoplasmic calcium waves and the genesis of systolic Ca(2+) alternans in cardiac myocytes lacking transverse tubules (t-tubules). These correspond to atrial cells of either small mammals or large mammals that have lost their t-tubules due to disease-induced structural remodeling (e.g., atrial fibrillation). A mathematical model was developed for a cluster of ryanodine receptors distributed on the cross section of a cell that was divided into 13 elements with a spatial resolution of 2 μm. Due to the absence of t-tubules, L-type Ca(2+) channels were only located in the peripheral elements close to the cell-membrane surface and produced Ca(2+) signals that propagated toward central elements by triggering successive Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) via Ca(2+) diffusion between adjacent elements. Under control conditions, the Ca(2+) signals did not fully propagate to the central region of the cell. However, with modulation of several factors responsible for Ca(2+) handling, such as the L-type Ca(2+) channels (Ca(2+) influx), SERCA pumps (sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) uptake), and ryanodine receptors (SR Ca(2+) release), Ca(2+) wave propagation to the center of the cell could occur. These simulation results are consistent with previous experimental data from atrial cells of small mammals. The model further reveals that spatially functional heterogeneity in Ca(2+) diffusion within the cell produced a steep relationship between the SR Ca(2+) content and the cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration. This played an important role in the genesis of Ca(2+) alternans that were more obvious in central than in peripheral elements. Possible association between the occurrence of Ca(2+) alternans and the model parameters of Ca(2+) handling was comprehensively explored in a wide range of one- and two-parameter spaces. In addition, the model revealed a spontaneous second Ca(2+) release in response to a single voltage stimulus pulse with SR Ca(2+) overloading and augmented Ca(2+) influx. This study provides what to our knowledge are new insights into the genesis of Ca(2+) alternans and spontaneous second Ca(2+) release in cardiac myocytes that lack t-tubules.",

  "title" : "RAS Mutations in Cutaneous Squamous-Cell Carcinomas in Patients Treated with BRAF Inhibitors",
  "description" : "BACKGROUND: Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas and keratoacanthomas are common findings in patients treated with BRAF inhibitors. METHODS: We performed a molecular analysis to identify oncogenic mutations (HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, CDKN2A, and TP53) in the lesions from patients treated with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. An analysis of an independent validation set and functional studies with BRAF inhibitors in the presence of the prevalent RAS mutation was also performed. RESULTS: Among 21 tumor samples, 13 had RAS mutations (12 in HRAS). In a validation set of 14 samples, 8 had RAS mutations (4 in HRAS). Thus, 60% (21 of 35) of the specimens harbored RAS mutations, the most prevalent being HRAS Q61L. Increased proliferation of HRAS Q61L-mutant cell lines exposed to vemurafenib was associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-pathway signaling and activation of ERK-mediated transcription. In a mouse model of HRAS Q61L-mediated skin carcinogenesis, the vemurafenib analogue PLX4720 was not an initiator or a promoter of carcinogenesis but accelerated growth of the lesions harboring HRAS mutations, and this growth was blocked by concomitant treatment with a MEK inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in RAS, particularly HRAS, are frequent in cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas and keratoacanthomas that develop in patients treated with vemurafenib. The molecular mechanism is consistent with the paradoxical activation of MAPK signaling and leads to accelerated growth of these lesions.

This type of agent can also be used to recognise fungal elements in biopsy sections. However, culture has certain benefits over microscopy; it is a more sensitive technique, since much more material can be examined and a definitive identity of the organism can be obtained.", null ],

  "title" : "CTGF drives autophagy, glycolysis and senescence in cancer-associated fibroblasts via HIF1 activation, metabolically promoting tumor growth.",
  "description" : "Previous studies have demonstrated that loss of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) in stromal cells drives the activation of the TGF-β signaling, with increased transcription of TGF-β target genes, such as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). In addition, loss of stromal Cav-1 results in the metabolic reprogramming of cancer-associated fibroblasts, with the induction of autophagy and glycolysis. However, it remains unknown if activation of the TGF-β / CTGF pathway regulates the metabolism of cancer-associated fibroblasts. Therefore, we investigated whether CTGF modulates metabolism in the tumor microenvironment. For this purpose, CTGF was overexpressed in normal human fibroblasts or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Overexpression of CTGF induces HIF-1α-dependent metabolic alterations, with the induction of autophagy/mitophagy, senescence, and glycolysis. Here, we show that CTGF exerts compartment-specific effects on tumorigenesis, depending on the cell-type. In a xenograft model, CTGF overexpressing fibroblasts promote the growth of co-injected MDA-MB-231 cells, without any increases in angiogenesis. Conversely, CTGF overexpression in MDA-MB-231 cells dramatically inhibits tumor growth in mice. Intriguingly, increased extracellular matrix deposition was seen in tumors with either fibroblast or MDA-MB-231 overexpression of CTGF. Thus, the effects of CTGF expression on tumor formation are independent of its extracellular matrix function, but rather depend on its ability to activate catabolic metabolism. As such, CTGF-mediated induction of autophagy in fibroblasts supports tumor growth via the generation of recycled nutrients, whereas CTGF-mediated autophagy in breast cancer cells suppresses tumor growth, via tumor cell self-digestion. Our studies shed new light on the compartment-specific role of CTGF in mammary tumorigenesis, and provide novel insights into the mechanism(s) generating a lethal tumor microenvironment in patients lacking stromal Cav-1. As loss of Cav-1 is a stromal marker of poor clinical outcome in women with primary breast cancer, dissecting the downstream signaling effects of Cav-1 are important for understanding disease pathogenesis, and identifying novel therapeutic targets.",

  "description" : "Mammographic density, defined as the percentage area of the breast in a mammogram that is comprised of fibroglandular tissue, is associated with risk of developing breast cancer. However, measures of mammographic density are subject to variation in the imaging process and in the assessments of observ-ers. Automatic volumetric measures of breast density remove much of this vari-ability, but their association with risk remains to be validated. We present den-sity measurements produced by area-based visual assessment via a visual ana-logue scale (VAS) and by volumetric assessment software (QuantraTM, Holog-ic Inc.) for digital mammograms of participants in a large-scale clinical study.VAS results were produced independently by two expert observers and av-eraged to give a final score. The distributions of average VAS scores (n = 22 327) and QuantraTM densities (n = 11 653) are shown by histograms and box plots. The average area-based density was 24.5% (SD 15.7%) and the average volumetric density was 17.0% (SD 6.0%). Inter-observer variability in visual area-based estimation is examined by a scatter plot matrix. It is inappropriate to directly compare area-based and volumetric measures of percentage breast density, since they are measuring different properties of the breast. Automatic volumetric assessment avoids the inter-observer variability shown in visual assessment, but work remains in establishing the association between volumetric measures and breast cancer risk.",

  "description" : "The epithelial cell surface of the endometrium undergoes substantial biochemical changes to allow embryo attachment and implantation in early pregnancy. We hypothesized that tissue macrophages influence these events to promote uterine receptivity. To investigate the role of macrophages in regulating epithelial cell expression of genes linked to glycan-mediated embryo adhesion, Ishikawa, RL95-2 and HEC1A endometrial epithelial cells were cultured alone or with unactivated or lipopolysaccharide-activated monocytic U937 cells, separated using transwell inserts. Expression of mRNAs encoding two α1,2-fucosyltransferases (FUT1, FUT2) was increased in all three epithelial cell lines following co-culture with U937 cells, and was associated with increased fucosylation of cell surface glycoproteins detected using lectins from Ulex europaeus (UEA-1) and Dolichos biflorus (DBA). FUT1 induction by U937 cells also occurred in primary endometrial epithelial cells collected in luteal but not proliferative phase. Activation of the interleukin-6 (IL6)/leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) cytokine signaling pathway with phosphorylation of STAT3 and elevated SOCS3 mRNA expression was evident in epithelial cells stimulated by U937 co-culture. Several recombinant macrophage-secreted cytokines exerted stimulatory or inhibitory effects on FUT1 and FUT2 mRNA expression, and the macrophage-derived cytokine LIF partially replicated the effects of U937 cells on both FUT1 and FUT2 expression and UEA-1 and DBA lectin reactivity in Ishikawa cells. These results suggest that macrophage-derived factors including LIF might facilitate development of an implantation-receptive endometrium by regulating surface glycan structures in epithelial cells.

  "description" : "BackgroundOur past work suggests a vital role for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in normal cortical development. Abnormal cortical development occurs from the earliest stages following fluid obstruction in the developing brain of a hydrocephalic fetus. Here, we studied development of the cerebral cortex in the curly-tail mouse model of neural tube defects (NTDs). Curly tail litters exhibit a variety of NTDs including exencephaly and spina bifida. A proportion of littermates have no apparent defect. Materials and methodsHomozygous curly-tail mice were time-mated and injected with 2, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 60 mg/kg) on day E17. Fetuses were harvested on day E19 and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. After cryoprotection in 20% sucrose, whole fetuses were sectioned at 25 μm on a Leica cryostat. Sections were air dried before immunocytochemical staining with anti-BrdU antibody (Nova Castro, UK). Images were taken on a Leica DMLB microscope using a Coolsnap camera (Princeton Instruments) and Metaview Software (Universal Imaging). ResultsCurly tail fetuses with exencephaly showed almost total degeneration of the cortex, as a result of exposure of the neuroepithelium to amniotic fluid. Among curly-tail fetuses with a closed brain, all but one showed abnormal migration of BrdU labelled cells. This varied from no apparent migration from the germinal epithelium to a random pattern of stained cells throughout the different zones of the cortex. This compared to the laminar distribution of labelled cells at the top of the cortex, adjacent to the marginal zone, in normal control mice. ConclusionWhile exencephaly is associated with degeneration of the neuroepithelium, mice with a genetic predisposition to neural tube defects show abnormal development of the cerebral cortex, specifically with disturbance of the migration of cells from the germinal zone into the developing cortex.",

  "description" : "Within the core molecular clock, protein phosphorylation and degradation play a vital role in determining circadian period. The 'after-hours' (Afh) mutation in mouse slows the degradation of the core clock protein CRY, lengthening the period of the molecular clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei and behavioural wheel-running rhythms.

Overall there is a trend towards period lengthening and a decrease in amplitude of PER2::LUC rhythms throughout the brain. Imaging of single cells from the arcuate and dorsomedial nuclei revealed this reduction in tissue oscillator amplitude to be due to a decrease in the amplitude, rather than a desynchrony, of single cells. Consistent with existing models of oscillator function this cellular phenotype was associated with a greater susceptibility to phase-shifting stimuli in vivo and in vitro, with light evoking high amplitude Type 0 resetting in Afh mutant mice.

The compounds identified in the lower initial concentration experiments were more oxidised compared to those that were found to be more abundant in the higher initial concentration experiments with average O:C ratios of 0.51 and 0.27, respectively. Photochemical ageing led to a more complex SOA composition with a larger contribution coming from lower molar mass, higher generation products, where both double bonds had been oxidised. This effect was more evident in the experiments conducted using the lower initial precursor concentration; a finding confirmed by the temporal behaviour of key organic mass fragment measured by an Aerosol Mass Spectrometer.

  "description" : "We have implemented a gas cluster ion beam (GCIB) system developed by Ionoptika Ltd (Southampton, UK) with sufficient control to allow us to exploit the unique capabilities of our J105 instrument for imaging and depth profiling.

We have performed a direct comparison with C60 ions on the same samples in the same instrument. The GCIB beams are more difficult to focus than the C60+ ion beam, making single-cell imaging difficult, although spot sizes of 15–20 µm are readily obtainable for Ar1000 and Ar2000, providing good resolution for larger area imaging on tissue section/biopsy samples. In this paper, we present results from the assessment of these new beams as primary ions for the analysis of ‘real’, complex biological systems. Initial spectra and those following increased primary ion bombardment were compared for in vitro cultured cells deposited on silicon and cryo-sectioned tumour samples originating in vivo.

  "title" : "Maternal Perception of Reduced Fetal Movements Is Associated with Altered Placental Structure and Function",
  "description" : "BACKGROUND: Maternal perception of reduced fetal movement (RFM) is associated with increased risk of stillbirth and fetal growth restriction (FGR). DFM is thought to represent fetal compensation to conserve energy due to insufficient oxygen and nutrient transfer resulting from placental insufficiency. To date there have been no studies of placental structure in cases of DFM. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether maternal perception of reduced fetal movements (RFM) is associated with abnormalities in placental structure and function. DESIGN: Placentas were collected from women with RFM after 28 weeks gestation if delivery occurred within 1 week. Women with normal movements served as a control group. Placentas were weighed and photographs taken. Microscopic structure was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining and image analysis. System A amino acid transporter activity was measured as a marker of placental function. Placentas from all pregnancies with RFM (irrespective of outcome) had greater area with signs of infarction (3.5% vs. 0.6%; p<0.01), a higher density of syncytial knots (p<0.001) and greater proliferation index (p<0.01). Villous vascularity (p<0.001), trophoblast area (p<0.01) and system A activity (p<0.01) were decreased in placentas from RFM compared to controls irrespective of outcome of pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of abnormal placental morphology and function in women with RFM and supports the proposition of a causal association between placental insufficiency and RFM. This suggests that women presenting with RFM require further investigation to identify those with placental insufficiency.",

  "description" : "The short QT syndrome (SQTS) is a genetically heterogeneous condition characterized by abbreviated QT intervals and an increased susceptibility to arrhythmia and sudden death. This simulation study identifies arrhythmogenic mechanisms in the rapid-delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Kr))-linked SQT1 variant of the SQTS. Markov chain (MC) models were found to be superior to Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) models in reproducing experimental data regarding effects of the N588K mutation on KCNH2-encoded hERG. These ionic channel models were then incorporated into human ventricular action potential (AP) models and into 1D and 2D idealised and realistic transmural ventricular tissue simulations and into a 3D anatomical model. In single cell models, the N588K mutation abbreviated ventricular cell AP duration at 90% repolarization (APD(90)) and decreased the maximal transmural voltage heterogeneity (δV) during APs. This resulted in decreased transmural heterogeneity of APD(90) and of the effective refractory period (ERP): effects that are anticipated to be anti-arrhythmic rather than pro-arrhythmic. However, with consideration of transmural heterogeneity of I(Kr) density in the intact tissue model based on the ten Tusscher-Noble-Noble-Panfilov ventricular model, not only did the N588K mutation lead to QT-shortening and increases in T-wave amplitude, but δV was found to be augmented in some local regions of ventricle tissue, resulting in increased tissue vulnerability for uni-directional conduction block and predisposing to formation of re-entrant excitation waves. In 2D and 3D tissue models, the N588K mutation facilitated and maintained re-entrant excitation waves due to the reduced substrate size necessary for sustaining re-entry. Thus, in SQT1 the N588K-hERG mutation facilitates initiation and maintenance of ventricular re-entry, increasing the lifespan of re-entrant spiral waves and the stability of scroll waves in 3D tissue.",

  "description" : "Previous research has seen difficulties in establishing clear discrimination by principal component analysis (PCA) between drug-treated cells analysed by single point SR-FTIR spectroscopy, relative to multisampling cell monolayers by conventional FTIR.

Consequently, chemometric distinction of cell spectra treated with multiple drugs is difficult even with supervised methods. In an effort to separate cell cycle chemistry from cellular response chemistry in the spectra, renal carcinoma cells were stained with propidium iodide and fluorescent-activated cell sorted (FACS) after exposure to a number of chemotherapeutic compounds; 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and a set of novel gold-based experimental compounds. The cell spectra were analysed separately by PCA in G1, S or G2/M phase. The mode of action of established drug 5FU, known to disrupt S phase, was confirmed by FACS analysis. The chemical signature of 5FU-treated cells discriminated against both the control and gold-compound (KF0101)-treated cell spectra, suggesting a different mode of action due to a difference in cellular response.",

  "description" : "The effect on deep convection of large-scale potential vorticity (PV) anomalies and their associated tropospheric stable layers is complex and not well understood. This article examines the meteorological events of 9 July 2007 (IOP7b of the Convective and Orographically-induced Precipitation Study (COPS)), which was dominated by an upper-level PV anomaly that stretched from the UK to southern France and as far northeast as Denmark. Three precipitation regions were identified from the case: lines of intense storms beneath the PV anomaly; less intense, more widespread convective precipitation to the east of the PV anomaly; and, in between, a region of no precipitation. The latter of these coincided with the high-resolution measurements andmodel analyses from COPS. The extensive and varied data analyzed in this investigation show that convective available potential energy (CAPE) was present in this region (the distribution of CAPE and convective inhibition (CIN) is presented via an innovative, pseudo-3D visualization that allows horizontal and vertical interactions to be considered). However, convection was capped by a complex arrangement of dry layers; the base of the key layer was at 750 hPa. These dry layers descended separately from the upper troposphere, moving around the PV anomaly as it developed from a breaking Rossby wave to the west during the seven days before the IOP. This case adds to other studies that show that descent of complex dry layers is an important mechanism for forming convection-inhibiting atmospheric lids in Western Europe. A simple conceptual model is developed that synthesizes the effect of large-scale PV anomalies on deep convection from a series of consistent case studies. This model has significant implications for storm forecasting and projections of storminess in future climates, as it highlights the importance of thin structures that can advect hundreds of km before having an impact.",

  "description" : "This contribution addresses the subject of engine intake filtration systems for rotorcraft. The reader is introduced to their purpose, which is to eliminate the risk of particle ingestion by the engine, a situation which can cause irrevocable damage to key components. The risk is significantly elevated during a condition known as brownout, in which the rotor wake of a helicopter in ground effect interacts with loose sediment, causing the generation of a dust cloud. In such a condition, IBF successfully removes particles from the engine-bound air at the expense of a pressure drop which grows temporally. This decreases the overall intake efficiency, but at varying degrees dependent on certain factors. An increase in deterioration rate is caused by but not limited to: an increase in incident velocity; and a decrease of mean particle size. However the rate may be slowed by operating the filter at a tangential angle to the flow. The present work uses CFD to carry out a parametric study into the factors affecting particle deposition and uses the results to form a semi-analytical model of pressure drop and ultimately predict the transient intake efficiency for IBF-fitted rotorcraft.",

  "description" : "The Id family of helix-loop-helix proteins function as negative regulators of cell differentiation and as positive regulators of G1 cell cycle control. We report here that enforced overexpression of the Id3 gene suppresses the colony-forming efficiency of primary rat embryo fibroblasts. Cotransfection with the antiapoptotic Bcl2 or BclXL gene alleviates this suppression and leads to cell immortalization. Consistent with this, enforced expression of Id genes in isolation was found to be a strong inducer of apoptosis in serum-deprived fibroblast cells. Id3-induced apoptosis was mediated at least in part through p53-independent mechanisms and could be efficiently rescued by Bcl2, BclXL, and the basic helix-loop-helix protein E47, which is known to oppose the functions of Id3 in vivo through the formation of stable heterodimers. Enforced overexpression of Id proteins has previously been shown to promote the cell cycle S phase in serum-deprived embryo fibroblasts (R. W. Deed, E. Hara, G. Atherton, G. Peters, and J. D.

The extent of apoptosis induced by loss- and gain-of-function Id3 mutants and by wild-type Id3 either alone or in combination with the Bcl2, BClXL, and E47 genes was invariably correlated with the relative magnitude of cell cycle S phase promotion. In addition, Id3-transfected cell populations displaying apoptosis and those in S phase were largely coincident in different experiments.

Asenapine is an atypical antipsychotic approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in adults for treatment of schizophrenia or acute treatment, as monotherapy or adjunct therapy to lithium or valproate, of manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder. OBJECTIVES: Based on the receptor pharmacology of asenapine, the current study assessed the efficacy and mechanism of action of asenapine to improve a subchronic phencyclidine (PCP)-induced deficit in visual recognition memory using the novel object recognition (NOR) paradigm in the rat, a paradigm of relevance to cognition in schizophrenia. METHODS: Female-hooded Lister rats received vehicle or PCP (2 mg/kg, i.p.) for 7 days, followed by a 7-day washout. On the test day, rats were given asenapine (0.001-0.1 mg/kg, s.c.) alone or in combination with the D(1) receptor antagonist SCH-23390 (0.05 mg/kg, i.p.) or 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY100635 (1 mg/kg, i.p.). Time spent exploring two identical objects during a 3-min acquisition trial (followed by a 1-min intertrial interval) and then a familiar and a novel object for another 3 min (retention trial) were recorded onto videotape and scored blind. RESULTS: In the retention trial, vehicle- but not PCP-treated animals explored the novel object significantly more than the familiar object (p < 0.001). Asenapine (0.01-0.075 mg/kg) reversed PCP-induced deficits in NOR (p < 0.01-0.001) in a dose-related manner. This effect was antagonised by SCH-23390 but not by WAY100635.

  "description" : "T lymphocytes mediate skin sensitisation and allergic contact dermatitis. Not unexpectedly, therefore, there is considerable interest in the use of T lymphocyte-based assays as alternative strategies for the identification of skin sensitising chemicals. However, in addition to accurate identification of hazards the development of effective risk assessments requires that information is available about the relative skin sensitising potency of contact allergens. The purpose of this article is to consider the relationships that exist between the characteristics of T lymphocyte responses to contact allergens and the effectiveness/potency of sensitisation. We propose that there are 3 aspects of T lymphocyte responses that have the potential to impact on the potency of sensitisation. These are: (a) the magnitude of response, and in particular the vigour and duration of proliferation and the clonal expansion of allergen-reactive T lymphocytes, (b) the quality of response, including the balance achieved between effector and regulatory cells, and (c) the breadth of response and the clonal diversity of T lymphocyte responses. A case is made that there may be opportunities to exploit an understanding of T lymphocyte responses to contact allergens to develop novel paradigms for predicting skin sensitising potency and new approaches to risk assessment.",

The purpose of this article is to consider the relationships that exist between the characteristics of T lymphocyte responses to contact allergens and the effectiveness/potency of sensitisation. We propose that there are 3 aspects of T lymphocyte responses that have the potential to impact on the potency of sensitisation. These are: (a) the magnitude of response, and in particular the vigour and duration of proliferation and the clonal expansion of allergen-reactive T lymphocytes, (b) the quality of response, including the balance achieved between effector and regulatory cells, and (c) the breadth of response and the clonal diversity of T lymphocyte responses. A case is made that there may be opportunities to exploit an understanding of T lymphocyte responses to contact allergens to develop novel paradigms for predicting skin sensitising potency and new approaches to risk assessment.", null ],

  "description" : "The involvement of beta1 integrins in osteoclast function has been investigated by utilising an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) approach. 18-mer antisense and control phosphorothioate ODNs were made to a conserved internal region of beta1 integrin sequence (nucleotide positions 1634-1651 of the human beta1 fibronectin receptor). These were tested on rabbit osteoclasts for anti-adhesive and resorptive effects mediated by alphaVbeta3 and alpha2beta1, the major integrins of osteoclasts. Antisense, but not control, beta1 ODNs inhibited osteoclast adhesion to collagen-coated glass (by up to 70%), but not to glass coated with vitronectin, fibronectin or fibrinogen. Adhesion to dentine and subsequent resorption were also inhibited (up to 60%) in a sequence-specific manner. The mechanism of action was verified using both a melanoma cell line, DX3, which expresses multiple integrins at high level including alphaVbeta3 and alpha2beta1, and in a rabbit osteoclast marrow culture (BMC) system. Exposure of DX3 cells to antisense ODN for up to 48 hours reduced adhesion to FCS- and collagen-coated glass, and concomitantly inhibited beta1 protein expression assessed by FACS and Western blot analysis; expression of other integrin subunits, alphaV and beta3, was unaffected. Similarly, the beta1 protein levels in the BMC were reduced by > 75% without any effect on actin expression. These data reveal the utility of antisense ODNs in exploring osteoclast biology and further define the functional role of osteoclastic beta1 integrin(s).",

  "description" : "Caveolins are the principal protein component of caveolae, plasma membrane invaginations found in most cell types. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) plays a major role in oncogenesis through its various functions in lipid transport, membrane trafficking, and signal transduction.

More recently, loss of stromal Cav-1 expression was linked to poor survival and increased metastatic potential in breast and prostate cancer. To date, there is no study addressing the clinical significance of Cav-1 expression in malignant melanoma (MM). Our study consisted of 44 cases of MM: 12 MM lymph node metastases from patients with short survival, 12 MM lymph node metastases from patients with long survival and 20 primary MM. All cases were stained with Cav-1 antibodies. Cav-1 expression in melanoma and stromal cells was quantified using a 3 point scale: 0 = no staining, 1 = diffuse weak staining or strong staining in < 30% of cells, and 2 = diffuse strong staining. A score of 0-1 represented low Cav-1 expression and a score of 2 represented high Cav-1 expression. In patients with MM lymph node metastases, a low stromal Cav-1 expression was associated with shorter survival when compared to the high stromal Cav-1 expression group (median survival 252 days versus 3,508 days, p value 0.0054). Conversely, high Cav-1 expression in melanoma cells was associated with a longer survival in primary MM (p < 0.0001). In conclusion, high expression of stromal Cav-1 correlates with longer survival in malignant melanoma metastases, and high expression of Cav-1 in melanoma cells correlates with longer survival in primary malignant melanoma.",

  "description" : "In amphibians, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulates skin melanophores by inducing secretion of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone in the pituitary gland. However, it is unknown whether this tripeptide neurohormone exerts any direct effects on pigment cells, namely, on human melanocytes, under physiological conditions. Therefore, we have investigated whether TRH stimulates pigment production in organ-cultured human hair follicles (HFs), the epithelium of which expresses both TRH and its receptor, and/or in full-thickness human skin in situ. TRH stimulated melanin synthesis, tyrosinase transcription and activity, melanosome formation, melanocyte dendricity, gp100 immunoreactivity, and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor expression in human HFs in a pituitary gland-independent manner. TRH also stimulated proliferation, gp100 expression, tyrosinase activity, and dendricity of isolated human HF melanocytes. However, intraepidermal melanogenesis was unaffected. As TRH upregulated the intrafollicular production of \"pituitary\" neurohormones (proopiomelanocortin transcription and ACTH immunoreactivity) and as agouti-signaling protein counteracted TRH-induced HF pigmentation, these pigmentary TRH effects may be mediated in part by locally generated melanocortins and/or by MC-1 signaling. Our study introduces TRH as a novel, potent, selective, and evolutionarily highly conserved neuroendocrine factor controlling human pigmentation in situ.

  "title" : "Properties and applications of polymer support fluids in geotechnical engineering",
  "description" : "Synthetic polymer fluids have been used as an alternative to conventional bentoniteslurries for the excavation of foundation elements over the last two decades. Thus far their use has excited polarised views in the industry – some construction professionals avoid using them after hearing ‘horror stories’ about past failures whereas others believe that they are the future of support fluids because of the many benefits that they can offer. This situation has been found to be mainly due to a lack of understanding of what polymers really are and their properties. To address this issue, the various polymer products currently available in the market have been categorised based on their intended functions, and the fundamental properties of some of them have been characterised. The research showed that significant difference exists between polymers even of the same chemical family. Based on a series of rheological experiments, it was found that the properties of polymer fluids are highly dependent on the governing shear rate, time, and a range of site dependent factors. The research also showed that the current procedure for the interpretation of viscosity data is incorrect. After an analysis of the properties of currently available polymers, the latter part of the thesis describes a field trial carried out at a site in Stratford, East London. The aims of the trial were twofold: to compare the performance between piles constructed using bentonite and polymer fluids, and to assess the effect of extended pile bore open time for pile bores supported by polymers. From the results, it was found that the polymer piles showed much stiffer load–settlement response than the bentonite pile, and that a pile bore open time of up to 26 h had no adverse effect on the pile performance. The load test results have been carefully back-analysed using a range of methods. It was found that, compared to their bentonite counterparts, polymer fluids can improve the interface shearing resistance with Thanet Sand and the shear modulus of the Lambeth clay.",

  "description" : "Despite the extensive study of the biosynthesis of the complex molecule B (cobalamin), the mechanism by which the lower ligand 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB) is formed has remained something of a mystery. However, recent work has identified and characterized a DMB-synthase (BluB) responsible for the oxygen-dependent, single enzyme conversion of FMN to DMB. In this work, we have identified BluB homologs from the aerobic purple, nonsulfur, photosynthetic bacterium and the aerobic soil bacterium and have demonstrated DMB synthesis by the use of a novel complementation assay in which a B deficient strain, substituted with the precursor cobinamide is recovered either by the addition of DMB or by the recombinant expression of a gene. The DMB-synthetic activity of the purified recombinant BluB enzymes was further confirmed by providing the enzyme with FMNH and oxygen and observing the formation of DMB by HPLC. The formation of a 4a-peroxyflavin intermediate, the first step in the oxygen dependent mechanism of DMB biosynthesis, is reported here and is the first intermediate in the enzyme catalysed reaction to be demonstrated experimentally to date.

  "description" : "Post-streptococcal guttate psoriasis only sometimes progresses to the persistent plaque psoriasis. We have previously proposed that psoriasis is driven by multiple extradomain A+ fibronectin (EDA+ FN) 'feedback loops'. The psoriasis-specific loop, the 'keratinocyte loop', depends upon expression by keratinocytes of α5β1 integrin. In normal skin, α5β1 expression is minimal or absent in resting epithelial cells, where basal cells are anchored to the laminin component of the basement membrane (via integrins α6β4 and α3β1). However, when the laminin layer is disrupted, due to wounding for instance, α5β1 is then strongly expressed by basal cells as a means for anchoring. At uninvolved skin sites in patients with psoriasis the laminin layer within the basement membrane is disrupted, with a consequential increase in the expression by basal keratinocytes of EDA+ FN and α5β1. We are postulating that in guttate psoriasis streptococcal lytic enzymes, and in particular streptokinase, may - via plasminogen activation - initiate a disruption of the laminin layer in the basement membrane. It is also possible that the expression by proliferating keratinocytes of plasminogen-activating factor might result in additional laminin digestion. The suggestion is that progression of guttate psoriasis to full-blown plaque psoriasis, or to its spontaneous resolution, is governed largely by the triggering of humoral immune responses. Thus, if streptococcal lytic enzymes are neutralized by host antibodies in advance of irreversible and lasting damage to the basement membrane of the dermal papillae, then guttate psoriasis will resolve spontaneously. In contrast, if permanent damage is induced prior to effective neutralization of the relevant bacterial toxins, then keratinocytes will become chronically destabilized. The consequence will be to liberate keratinocytes to proliferate in response to various stimuli, and to continue to elaborate plasminogen activation enzymes; the combined effect being, in concert with immunological priming, to precipitate and sustain plaque psoriasis.",

  "description" : "AIMS: The purpose of this study was to investigate the performance of non-invasive diagnostic tests such as galactomannan enzyme immunoassay and quantitative PCR in the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA), and how these tests are impacted upon by the use of different classes of antifungal agents in an in-vivo model of IA. METHODS: A standardised rat inhalation model of IA was used to examine the effects of an azole, posaconazole, a polyene, amphotericin B and an echinocandin caspofungin. Daily blood samples were collected for subsequent analysis using a commercially available galactomannan assay and an inhouse qPCR assay. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in the CE/g of Aspergillus fumigatus in the lungs of each group. qPCR was statistically more sensitive than galactomannan for both the early detection of infected controls (p=0.045) and for overall detection (p=0.018). However, antifungal treatment significantly reduced the overall sensitivity of qPCR (p=0.020); these effects were due to posaconazole and caspofungin. In the latter stages of infection (days 4 and 5) there were no significant differences in the numbers of infections detected by galactomannan and qPCR; however, the antifungal class used caused significant qualitative differences (p=0.041). Galactomannan showed improved detection in posaconazole-treated animals. CONCLUSIONS: Previous exposure to antifungal therapy must be considered when interpreting either qPCR or galactomannan-based IA diagnostics as this study has shown that individual classes of antifungal agents impact upon the dynamics of antigen and DNA release into the circulation.",

  "description" : "BACKGROUND: Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depends on the initial activation of CD4(+) T cells responsive to myelin autoantigens. The key antigen presenting cell (APC) population that drives the activation of naïve T cells most efficiently is the dendritic cell (DC). As such, we should be able to trigger EAE by transfer of DC that can present the relevant autoantigen(s). Despite some sporadic reports, however, models of DC-driven EAE have not been widely adopted. We sought to test the feasibility of this approach and whether activation of the DC by toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 ligation was a sufficient stimulus to drive EAE. FINDINGS: Host mice were seeded with myelin basic protein (MBP)-reactive CD4+ T cells and then were injected with DC that could present the relevant MBP peptide which had been exposed to lipopolysaccharide as a TLR-4 agonist. We found that this approach induced robust clinical signs of EAE. CONCLUSIONS: DC are sufficient as APC to effectively drive the differentiation of naïve myelin-responsive T cells into autoaggressive effector T cells. TLR-4-stimulation can activate the DC sufficiently to deliver the signals required to drive the pathogenic function of the T cell.

  "title" : "Cleavage modelling with experimental particle size distribution and novel particle failure criterion",
  "description" : "Most of the existing local approaches for cleavage fracture derive from the assumptions that global failure is a weakest-link event and that only the tail of the size distribution of micro-crack initiating features is significant. This appears to be sufficient in predicting lower shelf toughness under high constraint conditions, but may fail when attempting to predict toughness in the transition region or for low constraint conditions when using the same parameters. While coupled ductile damage models with Beremin-like failure probability could be useful in the transition region, uncoupled models with “a posteriori” probability calculations are advantageous to the engineering community. Cleavage toughness predictions in the transition regime, which can be extended to low constraint conditions, are here made with improved criterion for particle failure and experimentally based size distribution of initiators for specific RPV steel. The model is shown to predict experimentally measured locations of cleavage initiators. Further, the model predicts the fracture toughness in a large part of the transition region and accurately predicts a measured shift with irradiation. All results are obtained without changes in model parameters. This suggests that the model can be used for assessing toughness changes due to constraint- and temperature-driven plasticity changes.",
  "texts" : [ "Cleavage modelling with experimental particle size distribution and novel particle failure criterion", "Most of the existing local approaches for cleavage fracture derive from the assumptions that global failure is a weakest-link event and that only the tail of the size distribution of micro-crack initiating features is significant. This appears to be sufficient in predicting lower shelf toughness under high constraint conditions, but may fail when attempting to predict toughness in the transition region or for low constraint conditions when using the same parameters. While coupled ductile damage models with Beremin-like failure probability could be useful in the transition region, uncoupled models with “a posteriori” probability calculations are advantageous to the engineering community. Cleavage toughness predictions in the transition regime, which can be extended to low constraint conditions, are here made with improved criterion for particle failure and experimentally based size distribution of initiators for specific RPV steel. The model is shown to predict experimentally measured locations of cleavage initiators. Further, the model predicts the fracture toughness in a large part of the transition region and accurately predicts a measured shift with irradiation. All results are obtained without changes in model parameters. This suggests that the model can be used for assessing toughness changes due to constraint- and temperature-driven plasticity changes.", null ],

The main aim of this review is to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge concerning the extent and nature of psychological measurement affecting people who complete the measures.

RESULTS: Several studies, using a variety of methods, have found measurement procedures to alter subsequent cognition, emotion, and behaviour. In many instances, the effects obtained were of up to medium size. However, the extent to which such studies are representative is not clear: do other studies which find no reactive effects of measurement not exist or do they exist but are not reported? CONCLUSIONS: Although measurement reactivity can yield medium-sized effects, our understanding of this phenomenon is still rudimentary. We do not know the precise circumstances that are likely to result in measurement reactivity: we cannot predict when problems are more likely to arise. There is a particular absence of studies of the mechanisms by which measurement reactivity arises. There is a need for a systematic review of this literature, which should aim to quantify the extent of measurement reactivity effects and to provide a firmer evidence base for theorizing about the sources of reactivity.",

  "title" : "Plasmalemmal Na+/Ca2+ exchanger modulates Ca2+-dependent exocytotic release of glutamate from rat cortical astrocytes.",
  "description" : "Astroglial excitability operates through increases in Ca2+cyt (cytosolic Ca2+), which can lead to glutamatergic gliotransmission. In parallel fluctuations in astrocytic Na+cyt (cytosolic Na+) control metabolic neuronal-glial signalling, most notably through stimulation of lactate production, which on release from astrocytes can be taken up and utilized by nearby neurons, a process referred to as lactate shuttle. Both gliotransmission and lactate shuttle play a role in modulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity. Consequently, we studied the role of the PMCA (plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase), NCX (plasma membrane Na+/Ca2+ exchanger) and NKA (Na+/K+-ATPase) in complex and coordinated regulation of Ca2+cyt and Na+cyt in astrocytes at rest and upon mechanical stimulation. Our data support the notion that NKA and PMCA are the major Na+ and Ca2+ extruders in resting astrocytes. Surprisingly, the blockade of NKA or PMCA appeared less important during times of Ca2+ and Na+ cytosolic loads caused by mechanical stimulation. Unexpectedly, NCX in reverse mode appeared as a major contributor to overall Ca2+ and Na+ homoeostasis in astrocytes both at rest and when these glial cells were mechanically stimulated. In addition, NCX facilitated mechanically induced Ca2+-dependent exocytotic release of glutamate from astrocytes. These findings help better understanding of astrocyte-neuron bidirectional signalling at the tripartite synapse and/or microvasculature. We propose that NCX operating in reverse mode could be involved in fast and spatially localized Ca2+-dependent gliotransmission, that would operate in parallel to a slower and more widely distributed gliotransmission pathway that requires metabotropically controlled Ca2+ release from the ER (endoplasmic reticulum).",

  "description" : "The present work was produced as part of the MUZIC consortium, a collaboration between a multi-university team from the UK and industrial partners working on the field of nuclear energy, fabrication of alloys and nuclear research. The aim of the project is to establish a multidiscipline mechanistic understanding of the corrosion and breakaway processes of zirconium alloys used as fuel cladding materials in the nuclear industry. A better understanding of the corrosion mechanism of zirconium alloys will not only aid the development of better performing alloys, but will also allow more accurate models to be developed to reliably predict the service life of existing alloys. This could lead to higher burn-up, increase of energy production and reduction of nuclear waste produced.This work seeks to provide a better understanding of the role of residual stresses in the oxide, which are produced during oxidation due to high Pilling-Bedworth ratio and their impact on oxide phase transformation and oxidation kinetics by employing high energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction techniques. This is achieved by observing how stresses change as oxide growth approaches and passes through transition of the corrosion kinetics, their evolution across the oxide thickness, in situ characterising stresses and phase growth early in oxidation process and how stress changes can affect corrosion properties.It was found that relatively high compressive stresses in the two oxide crystal structures are present. The stresses relax with time up to moments before transition where a possible threshold stress magnitude is reached to aid an extensive tetragonal to monoclinic phase transformation. This generalised tetragonal to monoclinic transformation is believed to produce highly stressed monoclinic crystal structure grains and cause defects in the oxide. The above observation is further supported by a decrease of the tetragonal zirconia content. This is the moment that the oxide looses its protective character and a transition of the corrosion kinetics occurs. By comparing different materials it was observed that the minimum magnitude of the tetragonal phase is lower in better performing alloys while the tetragonal content is some cases was relatively low. It is suggested that the amount of the tetragonal phase, in the oxide layer, is not as important as the rate of it transforming into monoclinic. The extent of tetragonal to monoclinic transformation, that introduces defects in the oxide, defines how protective an oxide layer is.The present work provides a contribution to the available knowledge of the importance of residual stresses in the oxide layer and metal substrate of zirconium alloys and how they can affect corrosion rates or act as a precursor to the corrosion transition.",

  "description" : "Introduction: Many neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by neuronal inclusion bodies that share common co-localizing proteins, including chaperone proteins like heat shock protein 27 (HSP27). Although HSP27 has been extensively investigated in vivo or in vitro with regard to normal protein homeostasis, its role in the pathogenesis of Frontotemporal Lobar degeneration (FTLD) or Motor Neurone Disease (MND) is unclear. Objective and Methods: The aim of this study is to determine the role of HSP27 in the pathogenesis of FTLD and MND by comparing the amount and distribution of HSP27 immunostaining in patients with FTLD and MND with normal controls and others with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Semi-quantitative rating of HSP27 staining was analysed by Pearson Chi-Square Test and non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test with post hoc Mann-Whitney test, respectively. Result: There were distinct patterns of HSP27 expression in FTLD and MND with respect to different types of neurons or glial cells.  In patients with FTLD and AD, numerous intensely immunostained HSP27-positive granules were observed in the cytoplasm of pyramidal neurons of the frontal and temporal cortex, along with diffuse clusters of granules within glial cells. In the hippocampus, these changes were particularly severe in CA regions, and in cells of the dentate gyrus. Similar, though less intense, changes were seen in these same brain areas in patients with MND and in control subjects. Generally, a greater proportion of patients with AD and FTLD were severely affected than in MND and controls. Conclusion: The expression patterns of HSP27 in these neurodegenerative diseases reflect the different degrees of ongoing neurodegeneration in these brain areas, and may evidence a misfolding of damaged or unwanted proteins leading to failures in protein degradation.",

  "description" : "Exploiting the substructure of jets observed at the LHC to better understand and interpret the experimental data has recently been a very active area of research. In this thesis we study the substructure of high-pt QCD jets, which form a background to many new physics searches. In particular, we explore in detail the perturbative distributions of a certain class of observables known as non-global jet shapes. More specifically, we identify and present state-of-the-art calculations, both at fixed-order and to all-orders in the perturbative expansion, of a set of large logarithms known as non-global logarithms. Hitherto, these logarithms have been largely mis-treated, and in many cases ignored, in the literature despite being first pointed out more than a decade ago. Our work has triggered the interest of many groups, particularly Soft and Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) groups, and led to a flurry of papers on non-global logarithms and related issues. Although our primary aim is to provide analytical results for hadron-hadron scattering environments, it is theoretically instructive to consider the simpler case of e+e- annihilation. We thus examine, in chapters 4, 5 and 6, the the said jet shapes in the latter environment and compute the full next-to-leading logarithmic resummation of the large logarithms present in the distribution for various jet definitions. We exploit the gained experience to extend our calculations to the more complex hadronic environment in chapter 7. We provide state-of-the-art resummation of the jet mass observable in vector boson + jet and dijet QCD processes at the LHC up to next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The resultant distribution of the former (vector boson + jet) process agrees well, after accounting for hadronisation corrections, with standard Monte Carlo event generators and potential comparisons to data from the LHC will be made soon.",

  "description" : "Natural Killer (NK) cells are innate immune cells that secrete lytic granules to directly kill virus-infected or transformed cells across an immune synapse. However, a major gap in understanding this process is in establishing how lytic granules pass through the mesh of cortical actin known to underlie the NK cell membrane.

Here we use two high-resolution imaging techniques to probe the synaptic organisation of NK cell receptors and filamentous (F)-actin. A combination of optical tweezers and live cell confocal microscopy reveals that microclusters of NKG2D assemble into a ring-shaped structure at the centre of intercellular synapses, where Vav1 and Grb2 also accumulate. Within this ring-shaped organisation of NK cell proteins, lytic granules accumulate for secretion. Using 3D-structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) to gain super-resolution of ~100 nm, cortical actin was detected in a central region of the NK cell synapse irrespective of whether activating or inhibitory signals dominate. Strikingly, the periodicity of the cortical actin mesh increased in specific domains at the synapse when the NK cell was activated. Two-colour super-resolution imaging revealed that lytic granules docked precisely in these domains which were also proximal to where the microtubule-organising centre (MTOC) polarised.

  "description" : "We have applied a novel pharmacokinetic model of the distribution of contrast media to dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI data from patients with hepatic neoplasms. The model uses data collected during the passage of a bolus of contrast medium and allows breath-hold image acquisition. The aims of the study were to investigate the feasibility of permeability mapping using the first pass technique and breath-hold acquisitions, and to examine the reproducibility of the technique and the effect of the liver's dual vascular supply on the assumptions of the model. Imaging was performed in 14 patients with hepatic neoplasms. Dynamic data clearly demonstrated differences in the timing and shape of the contrast medium concentration-time course curve in the systemic arterial and portal venous systems. Mapping of the arrival time (T(0)) of contrast medium allowed identification of tissue supplied by the hepatic arteries and portal vein. Hepatic tumours all showed typical hepatic arterial enhancement. Repeated measurements of endothelial permeability surface area product (k(fp)) and relative blood volume (rBV), performed in five patients, showed excellent reproducibility with variance ratios (V(r)) of 0.134 and 0.113, respectively. Measurement of enhancing tumour volume was also highly reproducible (V(r) = 0.096) and this was further improved by the use of T(0) maps to identify pixels supplied by the hepatic artery (V(r) = 0.026). Estimates of k(fp) and rBV in normal hepatic tissue supplied by the portal vein were highly inaccurate and these pixels were identified by use of the T(0) parameter and excluded from the analysis. In conclusion, dynamic MRI contrast enhancement combined with a pharmacokinetic model of the distribution of contrast media in the first pass allows us to produce highly reproducible parametric maps of k(fp) and rBV from hepatic tumours that are supplied by the hepatic arterial system using breath-hold acquisitions.",

For both smooth and rough boundaries, the\nsmectic order parameter remains non-zero across the entire chevron,\nimplying that layer identity is maintained across the chevron tip. Also, when the surface-stabilised chevron does eventually revert to a tilted layer structure, it does so via surface slippage, such that layer integrity is maintained throughout the chevron to tilted layer relaxation process.\n</p>", null ],

  "title" : "numerical modelling of accelerated charged particles by magnetic reconnection in solar flares",
  "description" : "In this thesis we introduce the fundamental theory leading to the occurrence of solar flares. Observations from different missions support theoretical postulates concerning the mechanism proposed for such events, ``magnetic reconnection'', where we illustrates its basic theory, and consider one of its most important consequences, ``particle acceleration''. DC electric field associated with magnetic reconnection is now widely studied as one of the primary processes of particle acceleration in solar flares. Individual particle trajectories and acceleration due to direct DC electric mechanism in solar flares are modelled here using two approaches. The first is the full particle trajectory approach by solving Lorentz equation of motion that fully describe particle's motion. To do so we wrote what we call the ``Full Code'' that solves numerically, using different methods, the Lorentz equation. The second approach, known by Guiding Centre Approximation (GCA) Theory, is widely used when particles behave adiabatically. For this approach we used an existing code called ``GCA'' to simulate particle trajectories. A full comparison is presented to show the applicability of the GCA theory and its efficiency and when it can be used. Both approaches operate on an analogous model trying to simulate magnetic reconnection leading to the formation of a current sheet where particles are primarily accelerated and gain sufficient energy allowing them to be ejected to the outer space or come back to the Sun's surface. We consider the 2-Dimensional MagnetoHydroDynamic ``MHD'' model generating data files for background fields which serve as an input for our particle trajectory codes. We extract some limitations for important parameters such as mass-to-charge ratio and grid size and perform experiments at different locations at the current sheet (at the centre, far away from the centre, and at magnetic islands) to fully discuss differences between the 2 approaches. This coupling between particle trajectory models and data on grid arising from finite difference models is studied numerically and analytically. Different numerical methods, relativistic effects, analytical configurations, particle specie and mass effects and some others are taken into account.",

  "description" : "Cell penetrating peptides have been the focus of drug delivery research for 15 years due to their apparent ability to deliver cargoes inside cells more readily than many other carriers. Using two of the most commonly studied peptides (tat47-57 and R9), the present study differs from previous work by deliberately choosing to observe uptake with lower peptide concentrations closer to potential therapeutic doses, and by implementing raster image correlation spectroscopy (RICS) on a commercial microscope to quantify uptake in parallel to other techniques such as fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), confocal microscopy, and mass spectroscopy.An initial study using mass spectrometry and ExPASy (Expert Protein Analysis System) revealed that the peptides are stable for at least one hour in PBS. Based on this initial information and other experimental conditions, the study took two main directions with regards to the peptide: the membrane interaction and accumulation in the cell.The peptides interaction with the cell membrane revealed that neither tat-TAMRA nor R9-TAMRA disrupts the membrane of cells: incorporation of FM2-10 in the membrane was not modified in K562 cells whilst it was in presence of the control lytic peptides GALA and mellitin. Based on this information confocal microscopy was utilised to assess the localisation on the cell membrane. Peptide binding to the membrane appeared to be heterogeneous in distribution at 1µM bulk concentration.Accumulation in cells of the peptides was observed incubated at 37°C, confocal microscopy showed punctuated distribution with intracellular aggregations of fluorescence measuring between 2.5-3.5µm in diameter. Co-staining with a nuclear dye revealed these aggregations to be focused around the nucleus of the cell. Initial FCS experiments indicated a concentration dependent accumulation of the peptide in the cells and a decrease of the intracellular diffusion coefficients at high concentration possibly corresponding with molecular crowding. Interestingly the anomalous diffusion model did not statistically improve the results.RICS was implemented to study the kinetics of entry of TAMRA labelled cell penetrating peptides in both Caco-2 and HeLa cells lines at concentrations between 500nM and 2µM. Concentrations above 1µM exhibited higher final intracellular concentrations, yet the measured diffusion coefficients were similarly independent of extracellular concentration. Both peptides appeared to enter the cell quickly with a fast initial uptake over the first 10 minutes, reaching a concentration maxima after 30 minutes.Overall, the study reveals that many published studies may be incorrect as they may only be reporting the presence of a fluorescent dye inside the cell not the peptide. The fast binding of the peptide to the membrane is likely to cause false positive results when traditionally studying internalisation kinetics such as using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy.

Methods:  Eight cases of FTLD-FUS (5 cases of atypical FTLD-U (aFTLD-U), 2 of Neuronal Intermediate Filament Inclusion Body Disease (NIFID) and 1 of Basophilic Inclusion Body Disease (BIBD)) were immunostained for FUS, TRN1, TRN2, TAF15 and EWS. 10 cases of FTLD associated with TDP-43 inclusions served as reference cases. Results:  The inclusion bodies in FTLD-FUS contained TRN1 and TAF15 and, to a lesser extent, EWS, but not TRN2. The patterns of immunostaining for TRN1 and TAF15 were very similar to that of FUS. None of these proteins was associated with tau or TDP-43 aggregations in FTLD. Conclusion:  Data suggest that FUS, TRN1 and TAF15 may participate in a functional pathway in an interdependent way, and imply that the function of TDP-43 may not necessarily be in parallel with, or complementary to, that of FUS, despite each protein sharing many similar structural elements. © 2012 The Authors.

  "description" : "The 17??-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 5 (17??-HSD 5) is involved in estrogen and androgen metabolism. In our study we tested the influence of environmental hormones, such as phytoestrogens (flavonoids, coumarins, coumestans), on reductive and oxidative 17??-HSD activity of the human 17??-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 5 (17??-HSD 5). These dietary substances were shown to be potent inhibitors of aromatase, different 17??-HSDs and seem to play an important role in delay of development of hormone dependent cancers. Our studies show that reductive and oxidative activity of the enzyme are inhibited by many dietary compounds, especially zearalenone, coumestrol, quercetin and biochanin A. Among the group of flavones inhibitor potency is growing with increasing number of hydroxylations. We suggest that these substances are bound to the hydrophilic cofactor-binding pocket of the enzyme. An interesting inhibition pattern is observed for 18??-glycyrrhetinic acid, which has no influence on the oxidative but only on the reductive reaction. This indicates that this substrate binds to pH- and cofactor-depending sites at the active center of the enzyme. Copyright ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.",

  "title" : "A Brugia malayi homolog of macrophage migration inhibitory factor reveals an important link between macrophages and eosinophil recruitment during nematode infection.",
  "description" : "Infections with the helminth parasite Brugia malayi share many key features with Th2-mediated allergic diseases, including recruitment of eosinophils. We have investigated the dynamics of inflammatory cell recruitment under type 2 cytokine conditions in mice infected with B. malayi. Among the cells recruited to the site of infection is a novel population of \"alternatively activated\" macrophages that ablate cell proliferation and enhance Th2 differentiation. By profiling gene expression in this macrophage population, we found a dramatic up-regulation of a recently described eosinophil chemotactic factor, eosinophil chemotactic factor-L/Ym1, representing over 9% of clones randomly selected from a cDNA library. Because B. malayi is known to secrete homologs (Bm macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)-1 and -2) of the human cytokine MIF, we chose to investigate the role this cytokine mimic may play in the development of the novel macrophage phenotype observed during infection. Strikingly, administration of soluble recombinant Bm-MIF-1 was able to reproduce the effects of live parasites, leading both to the up-regulation of Ym1 by macrophages and a marked recruitment of eosinophils in vivo. Because activity of Bm-MIF-1 is dependent upon an amino-terminal proline, this residue was mutated to glycine; the resultant recombinant (Bm-MIF-1G) was unable to induce Ym1 transcription in macrophages or to mediate the recruitment of eosinophils. These data suggest that macrophages may provide a crucial link between helminth parasites, their active cytokine mimics, and the recruitment of eosinophils in infection.",

  "title" : "Discovery of serum protein biomarkers for prostate cancer progression by proteomic analysis.",
  "description" : "BACKGROUND: The incidence of prostate cancer (PCa) has increased in recent years due to the aging of the population and increased testing; however, mortality rates have remained largely unchanged. Studies have shown deficiencies in predicting patient outcome for both of the major PCa diagnostic tools, namely prostate specific antigen (PSA) and transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy. Therefore, serum biomarkers are needed that accurately predict prognosis of PCa (indolent vs. aggressive) and can thus inform clinical management. Aim: This study uses surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) mass spectrometry analysis to identify differential serum protein expression between PCa patients with indolent vs. aggressive disease categorised by Gleason grade and biochemical recurrence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 99 serum samples were selected for analysis. According to Gleason score, indolent (45 samples) and aggressive (54) forms of PCa were compared using univariate analysis. The same samples were then separated into groups of different recurrence status (10 metastatic, 15 biochemical recurrences and 70 non-recurrences) and subjected to univariate analysis in the same way. The data from Gleason score and recurrence groups were then analysed using multivariate statistical analysis to improve PCa biomarker classification. RESULTS: The comparison between serum protein spectra from indolent and aggressive samples resulted in the identification of twenty-six differentially expressed protein peaks (p<0.05), of which twenty proteins were found with 99% confidence. A total of 18 differentially expressed proteins (p<0.05) were found to distinguish between recurrence groups; three of these were robust with p<0.01. Sensitivity and specificity within the Gleason score group was 73.3% and 60% respectively and for the recurrence group 70% and 62.5%. CONCLUSION: SELDI-TOF-MS technology has facilitated the discovery of prognostic biomarkers in serum that can successfully discriminate aggressive from indolent PCa and also differentiate between recurrence groups.",

  "description" : "Apoptosis plays an important role in immune responses, but little is known about its involvement in contact hypersensitivity (CH). In this study, we have investigated the role of Fas/Fas ligand (FasL)-mediated apoptosis in the pathogenesis of CH. Mice were sensitized by one topical application of 100 microl of 3% oxazolone to shaved skin of the abdomen. Six days later, CH was provoked by challenging both sides of sensitized mouse right ear with 15 microl of 1% oxazolone. Using a DNA ladder assay, we found that apoptosis was induced in the skin of oxazolone-sensitized mice 24-96 h after allergen challenge. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis flow cytometric assay showed that early apoptotic CD4(+) T cells (annexin V-FITC(+)PI(-)), but not late apoptotic CD4(+) T cells (annexin V-FITC(+)PI(+)), increased in the inflamed skin of mice with CH. Moreover, the expressions of mRNAs for T helper (Th2) cytokine (interleukin (IL)-4), Th1 cytokine (interferon (IFN)-gamma) and proapoptotic molecules (Bax, Fas, FasL and IL-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE)/caspase-1) were significantly elevated in the oxazolone-sensitized mouse skin 6-72 h after allergen challenge. Dramatic increase in IL-10 mRNA was only observed in the sensitized mouse skin 6 and 12 h after allergen challenge. Furthermore, CH was significantly inhibited with decreased apoptosis and early apoptotic CD4(+) T cells in inflamed skin in Fas mutant lpr/lpr mice compared to wild-type mice, whereas there were no significant differences in IL-4, IFN-gamma, IL-10, Bax and ICE mRNAs in the inflamed skin of CH between lpr/lpr and wild-type mice. Our results thus suggest that Fas/FasL pathway partially contributes to apoptosis in murine CH and that Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis plays a partial role in the development of CH. The contribution of Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis to CH appears independent of Th1 and Th2 cytokines.",

However, the mechanism(s) by which these drugs exert their anti-cancer effects are not fully understood.

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: CTCL cell lines and primary CTCL cells were treated in vitro with vorinostat or romidepsin, or with STAT3 pathway inhibitors. Cell cycle parameters and apoptosis were analysed by propidium iodide and annexin V/propidium iodide staining respectively. Cytokine expression was analysed using QRT-PCR and elisa assays.

KEY RESULTS: Vorinostat and romidepsin strongly down-regulated expression of the immunosuppressive cytokine, interleukin (IL)-10, frequently overexpressed in CTCL, at both the RNA and protein level in CTCL cell lines and at the RNA level in primary CTCL cells. Vorinostat and romidepsin also increased expression of IFNG RNA and decreased expression of IL-2 and IL-4 RNA, although to a lesser extent compared to IL-10. Transient exposure to vorinostat was sufficient to suppress IL-10 secretion but was not sufficient to irreversibly commit cells to undergo cell death. STAT3 pathway inhibitors decreased production of IL-10 and vorinostat/romidepsin partially decreased STAT3-dependent transcription without effects on STAT3 expression or phosphorylation.

  "description" : "We have recently shown that lipid mediators of the emerging endocannabinoid system (ECS) are key players of growth control of the human pilosebaceous unit. In this study, we asked whether the prototypic endocannabinoid anandamide (N-arachidonoylethanolamine, AEA) has a role in growth and survival of epidermal keratinocytes (KCs). Using human cultured KCs and skin organ-culture models, and by employing combined pharmacological and molecular approaches, we provide early evidence that AEA markedly suppresses KC proliferation and induces cell death, both in vitro and in situ. Moreover, we present that these cellular actions are mediated by a most probably constitutively active signaling mechanism that involves the activation of the metabotropic cannabinoid receptor CB(1) and a sequential engagement of the \"ionotropic cannabinoid receptor\" transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1). Finally, we demonstrate that the cellular effects of AEA are most probably due to a Ca(2+) influx via the non-selective, highly Ca(2+)-permeable ion channel TRPV1, and the concomitant elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration. The data reported here may encourage one to explore whether the targeted manipulation of the above signaling pathway of the cutaneous ECS could become a useful adjunct treatment strategy for hyperproliferative human dermatoses such as psoriasis or KC-derived skin tumors.",

Moreover, we present that these cellular actions are mediated by a most probably constitutively active signaling mechanism that involves the activation of the metabotropic cannabinoid receptor CB(1) and a sequential engagement of the \"ionotropic cannabinoid receptor\" transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1). Finally, we demonstrate that the cellular effects of AEA are most probably due to a Ca(2+) influx via the non-selective, highly Ca(2+)-permeable ion channel TRPV1, and the concomitant elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration. The data reported here may encourage one to explore whether the targeted manipulation of the above signaling pathway of the cutaneous ECS could become a useful adjunct treatment strategy for hyperproliferative human dermatoses such as psoriasis or KC-derived skin tumors.", null ],

  "description" : "Proteins containing ubiquitin-binding domains (UBDs) interact with ubiquitinated targets and regulate diverse biological processes, including endocytosis, signal transduction, transcription and DNA repair. Many of the UBD-containing proteins are also themselves monoubiquitinated, but the functional role and the mechanisms that underlie this modification are less well understood. Here, we demonstrate that monoubiquitination of the endocytic proteins Sts1, Sts2, Eps15 and Hrs results in intramolecular interactions between ubiquitin and their UBDs, thereby preventing them from binding in trans to ubiquitinated targets. Permanent monoubiquitination of these proteins, mimicked by the fusion of ubiquitin to their carboxyl termini, impairs their ability to regulate trafficking of ubiquitinated receptors. Moreover, we mapped the in vivo monoubiquitination site in Sts2 and demonstrated that its mutation enhances the Sts2-mediated effects of epidermal-growth-factor-receptor downregulation. We propose that monoubiquitination of ubiquitin-binding proteins inhibits their capacity to bind to and control the functions of ubiquitinated targets in vivo. ?? 2006 Nature Publishing Group.",

  "description" : "The present work was produced as part of the MUZIC consortium, a collaboration between a multi-university team from the UK and industrial partners working on the field of nuclear energy, fabrication of alloys and nuclear research. The aim of the project is to establish a multidiscipline mechanistic understanding of the corrosion and breakaway processes of zirconium alloys used as fuel cladding materials in the nuclear industry. A better understanding of the corrosion mechanism of zirconium alloys will not only aid the development of better performing alloys, but will also allow more accurate models to be developed to reliably predict the service life of existing alloys. This could lead to higher burn-up, increase of energy production and reduction of nuclear waste produced.This work seeks to provide a better understanding of the role of residual stresses in the oxide, which are produced during oxidation due to high Pilling-Bedworth ratio and their impact on oxide phase transformation and oxidation kinetics by employing high energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction techniques. This is achieved by observing how stresses change as oxide growth approaches and passes through transition of the corrosion kinetics, their evolution across the oxide thickness, in situ characterising stresses and phase growth early in oxidation process and how stress changes can affect corrosion properties.It was found that relatively high compressive stresses in the two oxide crystal structures are present. The stresses relax with time up to moments before transition where a possible threshold stress magnitude is reached to aid an extensive tetragonal to monoclinic phase transformation. This generalised tetragonal to monoclinic transformation is believed to produce highly stressed monoclinic crystal structure grains and cause defects in the oxide. The above observation is further supported by a decrease of the tetragonal zirconia content. This is the moment that the oxide looses its protective character and a transition of the corrosion kinetics occurs. By comparing different materials it was observed that the minimum magnitude of the tetragonal phase is lower in better performing alloys while the tetragonal content is some cases was relatively low. It is suggested that the amount of the tetragonal phase, in the oxide layer, is not as important as the rate of it transforming into monoclinic. The extent of tetragonal to monoclinic transformation, that introduces defects in the oxide, defines how protective an oxide layer is.The present work provides a contribution to the available knowledge of the importance of residual stresses in the oxide layer and metal substrate of zirconium alloys and how they can affect corrosion rates or act as a precursor to the corrosion transition.",

  "title" : "An investigation into laser deposition of machining chips and characteristics of the final clad",
  "description" : "Laser metal deposition is an additive manufacturing technique to build fully dense structures with a strong metallurgical bonding with the underlying material.  Spherical gas-atomised metal powders are principally used as build material which is a costly option and restricts its application on a wide scale. On the other hand, nonspherical particles produced by machining are much cheaper to produce and readily available as waste swarf which should be recycled. The use of machined particles as a viable form of build material for laser direct metal deposition has not been explored previously and is the subject of the investigations reported in this thesis.   In the first work, samples of carbon steel machining swarf in three size ranges were laser deposited to build thin walls. The produced walls exhibited fine martensitic microstructure with minimal porosity. As general trends, individual deposition tracks were found to be lower, and wider with an increase of particle size. 50% reduction in hardness was observed when using coarser particle size. This work was extended so as to build U-shaped structures with variable laser power in contrast to the previous work which was done with one set of processing parameter values. The microstructure observed was similar to that of the previous work. However, hardness has found to increase with decrease in laser power. After successful deposition and encouraging results from the process, machining swarf of Inconel 617 was used to produce corrosion resistant layers on a mild steel substrate. A Design of Experiment methodology was used to analyse the relationship between the processing parameters and the coated layer characteristics. The layer thickness and hardness were found to increase with the mass feed rate whilst an increase in laser power produced the opposite result. All layers had a predominantly dendritic microstructure and displayed remarkably higher corrosion resistance than the mild steel sample. The work was expanded to investigate the surface characteristics and corrosion resistance in a harsh corrosive environment, using different pH brine solutions. In this investigation, four layers were produced with two laser power and mass feed rate values. Accounting for all measurements, Inconel 617 swarf built layers provided very good corrosion protection and confirmed the viability of using this method as a low-cost corrosion protection for both mild and harsh environments. Since the investigations authored above were confined to swarf alone, the final chapter examines the comparison of stainless steel 316L thin wall structures produced with swarf and gas-atomised powder using similar processing conditions. The build materials performed similarly, but walls made from swarf were slightly shorter with a coarser microstructure and had poorer corrosion resistance than the powder equivalents.The results of these investigations confirm the feasibility of machining swarf as an alternative viable option. However, further research will help to explore its full potential.",

  "title" : "Hundreds of variants clustered in genomic loci and biological pathways affect human height.",
  "description" : "Most common human traits and diseases have a polygenic pattern of inheritance: DNA sequence variants at many genetic loci influence the phenotype. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified more than 600 variants associated with human traits, but these typically explain small fractions of phenotypic variation, raising questions about the use of further studies. Here, using 183,727 individuals, we show that hundreds of genetic variants, in at least 180 loci, influence adult height, a highly heritable and classic polygenic trait. The large number of loci reveals patterns with important implications for genetic studies of common human diseases and traits. First, the 180 loci are not random, but instead are enriched for genes that are connected in biological pathways (P = 0.016) and that underlie skeletal growth defects (P < 0.001). Second, the likely causal gene is often located near the most strongly associated variant: in 13 of 21 loci containing a known skeletal growth gene, that gene was closest to the associated variant. Third, at least 19 loci have multiple independently associated variants, suggesting that allelic heterogeneity is a frequent feature of polygenic traits, that comprehensive explorations of already-discovered loci should discover additional variants and that an appreciable fraction of associated loci may have been identified. Fourth, associated variants are enriched for likely functional effects on genes, being over-represented among variants that alter amino-acid structure of proteins and expression levels of nearby genes. Our data explain approximately 10% of the phenotypic variation in height, and we estimate that unidentified common variants of similar effect sizes would increase this figure to approximately 16% of phenotypic variation (approximately 20% of heritable variation). Although additional approaches are needed to dissect the genetic architecture of polygenic human traits fully, our findings indicate that GWA studies can identify large numbers of loci that implicate biologically relevant genes and pathways.",

  "title" : "Bcl-2-associated athanogene-1 (BAG-1): a transcriptional regulator mediating chondrocyte survival and differentiation during endochondral ossification.",
  "description" : "BAG-1, an anti-apoptotic protein, was identified by its ability to bind to BCL-2, HSP70-family molecular chaperones and nuclear hormone receptor family members. Two BAG-1 isoforms, BAG-1L (50 kDa) and BAG-1S (32 kDa) were identified in mouse cells and BAG-1 expression was reported in murine growth plate and articular chondrocytes. The present study aimed to elucidate the role of BAG-1 in the regulation of molecular mechanisms governing chondrocyte differentiation and turnover during endochondral ossification. In long bones of skeletally immature mice, we observed expression of BAG-1 in the perichondrium, osteoblasts, osteocytes in the bone shaft, bone marrow, growth plate and articular chondrocytes. Monolayer cultures of murine chondrocytic ATDC5 cells, which exhibited robust expression of both BAG-1 isoforms and the Bag-1 transcript, were utilized as an in vitro model to delineate the roles of BAG-1. Overexpression of BAG-1L in ATDC5 cells resulted in downregulation of Col2a1 expression, a gene characteristically downregulated at the onset of hypertrophy, and an increase in transcription of Runx-2 and Alkaline phosphatase, genes normally expressed at the onset of chondrocyte hypertrophy and cartilage mineralization in the process of endochondral ossification. We also demonstrated the anti-apoptotic role of BAG-1 in chondrocytes as overexpression of BAG-1 protected ATDC5 cells, which were subjected to heat-shock at 48 degrees C for 30 min, against heat-shock-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of the SOX-9 protein in ATDC5 cells resulted in increased Bag-1 gene expression. To further investigate the regulation of Bag-1 gene expression by SOX-9, CHO cells were co-transfected with the human Bag-1 gene promoter-Luciferase reporter construct and the human pSox-9 expression vector. Activity of the Bag-1 promoter was significantly enhanced by the SOX-9 protein. In conclusion, a novel finding of this study is the role of BAG-1 as a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in chondrocyte hypertrophy and cartilage mineralization during the process of endochondral ossification. Additionally, we have demonstrated for the first time the regulation of Bag-1 gene expression by SOX-9 and the anti-apoptotic role of BAG-1 in chondrocytic cells. Modulation of Bag-1 expression can therefore mediate chondrocyte differentiation and turnover, and offer further insight into the molecular regulation of endochondral ossification.",

  "description" : "The ubiquitous filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus secretes a number of allergens with protease activity and has been linked to a variety of allergic conditions such as Severe Asthma with Fungal Sensitization (SAFS) and Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA).

Understanding the dynamic expression of allergen proteases during growth of A. fumigatus may lead to further characterisation of the pathogenesis of these disorders as well as improved standardisation in the commercial production of these allergens. Secretion of proteases during germination and early growth of A. fumigatus was investigated in response to various complex protein sources (pig lung homogenate, mucin or casein). Protease inhibitor studies demonstrated that A. fumigatus (AF293 strain) secretes predominately serine proteases during growth in pig lung based medium and mainly metalloproteases during growth in casein based medium but suppressed protease secretion in unmodified Vogel's minimal medium and secreted both types in mucin based medium. Analysis of gene transcription and protein identification by mass spectrometry showed that the matrix metalloprotease, Mep/Asp f 5 and the serine protease, Alp1/Asp f 13, were upregulated and secreted during growth in pig lung medium, whereas Alp1 was predominately expressed and secreted in mucin based medium. In casein medium, the matrix metalloprotease, Lap1, was also upregulated and secreted in addition to Mep and Alp1. These findings suggest that A. fumigatus is able to detect different complex proteins available as substrates in its environment and regulate protease secretion accordingly.

It remains an open question how the reactivity of these B cells is regulated and in which extent such B cells play a role in physiological and pathological processes such as autoantibody production and autoimmunity.", null ],

  "description" : "This paper is concerned with the radiation of sound waves from a submerged cylindrical body which is coated by an imperfect elastic layer; that is, the coating only covers part of the cylinder. The focus of the study is to quantify the effect of the gap in the elastic layer on the radiated acoustic power. A finite element method is employed to determine the acoustic pressure field in the fluid and the displacement field in the coupled layer. This reveals that the effect of a modest sized gap in the coating does not markedly alter the radiated field except at distinct frequencies, at which values the coating exhibits strong fluid-coupled oscillations. We develop a simple analytical model to explain the resonance phenomenon and show that quasi-resonances arise when the wavelength of the deformation pattern 'matches' the azimuthal length of the surface of the coating. This resonant behaviour is conveniently captured by a single parameter Q, which is the ratio of the typical inertial fluid pressure induced by the wall oscillation to the stiffness of the elastic coating. For each choice of material parameters, there is shown to be an infinite set of values of Q corresponding to distinct quasi-resonance mode numbers. The effects on the radiated field due to variations in various physical parameters, such as acoustic wavenumber and elastic layer inertia, are also discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

  "description" : "Adsorption of actinyl ions onto mineral surfaces is one of the main mechanisms that control the migration of these ions in environmental systems. Here, we present computational classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the behavior of U(VI) in contact with different calcite surfaces. The calcium-uranyl-carbonate [Ca2UO2(CO3)3] species is shown to display both inner- and outer-sphere adsorption to the flat {101?4} and the stepped {314?8} and {31?2?16} planes of calcite. Free energy calculations, using the umbrella sampling method, are employed to simulate adsorption paths of the same uranyl species on the different calcite surfaces under aqueous condition. Outer-sphere adsorption is found to dominate over inner-sphere adsorption because of the high free energy barrier of removing a uranyl?carbonate interaction and replacing it with a new uranyl?surface interaction. An important binding mode is proposed involving a single vicinal water monolayer between the surface and the sorbed complex. From the free energy profiles of the different calcite surfaces, the uranyl complex was also found to adsorb preferentially on the acute-stepped {314?8} face of calcite, in agreement with experiment.",

An area of considerable interest and, in the context of hazard identification and characterization, an area of great importance is developing an understanding of the characteristics that confer on chemicals the ability to cause skin sensitization.

It is the last of these properties that is the subject of this article. The purpose here is to review the mechanisms through which skin sensitizers provide the triggers necessary for engagement of cutaneous DC. Of particular interest are the nature and function of danger signals elicited by skin sensitizing chemicals. Among the pathways considered here are those involving Toll-like receptors, C-type lectin receptors, neuropeptide receptors, prostanoid receptors, and the inflammasome. Collectively, danger signals in the skin provide a bridge between the innate and adaptive immune systems and are of pivotal importance for the initiation of cutaneous immune responses, including those to chemical allergens that result in skin sensitization.",

Of particular interest are the nature and function of danger signals elicited by skin sensitizing chemicals. Among the pathways considered here are those involving Toll-like receptors, C-type lectin receptors, neuropeptide receptors, prostanoid receptors, and the inflammasome. Collectively, danger signals in the skin provide a bridge between the innate and adaptive immune systems and are of pivotal importance for the initiation of cutaneous immune responses, including those to chemical allergens that result in skin sensitization.", null ],

To further define the transcriptional effect of UCNs that underpins their cardioprotective activity, a microarray analysis was carried out using an in vivo rat coronary occlusion model of I/R injury. Infusion of UCN1 or UCN2 before the onset of reperfusion resulted in the differential regulation of 66 and 141 genes respectively, the majority of which have not been described previously. Functional analysis demonstrated that UCN-regulated genes are involved in a wide range of biological responses, including cell death (e.g. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein), oxidative stress (e.g. nuclear factor erythroid derived 2-related factor 1/nuclear factor erythroid derived 2-like 1) and metabolism (e.g. Prkaa2/AMPK). In addition, both UCN1 and UCN2 were found to modulate the expression of a host of genes involved in G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signalling including Rac2, Gnb1, Dab2ip (AIP1), Ralgds, Rnd3, Rap1a and PKA, thereby revealing previously unrecognised signalling intermediates downstream of CRH receptors. Moreover, several of these GPCR-related genes have been shown previously to be involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, suggesting a link between CRH receptors and induction of MAPKs. In addition, we have shown that both UCN1 and UCN2 significantly reduce free radical damage following myocardial infarction, and comparison of the UCN gene signatures with that of the anti-oxidant tempol revealed a significant overlap.

  "description" : "Aging poses one of the largest risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease. The increased propensity toward vascular pathology with advancing age maybe explained, in part, by a reduction in the ability of circulating endothelial progenitor cells to contribute to vascular repair and regeneration. Although there is evidence to suggest that colony forming unit-Hill cells and circulating angiogenic cells are subject to age-associated changes that impair their function, the impact of aging on human outgrowth endothelial cell (OEC) function has been less studied. We demonstrate that OECs isolated from cord blood or peripheral blood samples from young and old individuals exhibit different characteristics in terms of their migratory capacity. In addition, age-related structural changes were discovered in OEC heparan sulfate (HS), a glycocalyx component that is essential in many signalling pathways. An age-associated decline in the migratory response of OECs toward a gradient of VEGF significantly correlated with a reduction in the relative percentage of the trisulfated disaccharide, 2-O-sulfated-uronic acid, N, 6-O-sulfated-glucosamine (UA[2S]-GlcNS[6S]), within OEC cell surface HS polysaccharide chains. Furthermore, disruption of cell surface HS reduced the migratory response of peripheral blood-derived OECs isolated from young subjects to levels similar to that observed for OECs from older individuals. Together these findings suggest that aging is associated with alterations in the fine structure of HS on the cell surface of OECs. Such changes may modulate the migration, homing, and engraftment capacity of these repair cells, thereby contributing to the progression of endothelial dysfunction and age-related vascular pathologies.",

  "description" : "BACKGROUND: This study investigated the potential clinical utility of circulating free DNA (cfDNA) as a source of BRAF mutation detection in patients enrolled into a phase II study of AZD6244, a specific MEK1/2 inhibitor, in patients with advanced melanoma. METHODS: BRAF mutations were detected using Amplification Refractory Mutation System allele-specific PCR. BRAF mutation status was assessed in serum-derived cfDNA from 126 patients enrolled into the study and from 94 matched tumour samples. RESULTS: Of 94 tumour samples, 45 (47.9%) were found to be BRAF mutation positive (BRAF+). Serum-derived cfDNA was BRAF+ in 33 of 126 (26.2%) samples, including in five samples for which tumour data were unavailable. Of BRAF+ tumours, 25 of 45 (55.6%) were BRAF+ in cfDNA. In three cases in which the tumour was negative, cfDNA was BRAF+. Progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with BRAF+ tumour and cfDNA was not significantly different compared with tumour BRAF+ but cfDNA BRAF-negative patients, indicating that cfDNA BRAF detection is not associated with poorer prognosis on PFS in stage III/IV advanced melanoma.

  "description" : "BACKGROUND: FFAR1 receptor is a long chain fatty acid G-protein coupled receptor which is expressed widely, but found in high density in the pancreas and central nervous system. It has been suggested that FFAR1 may play a role in insulin sensitivity, lipotoxicity and is associated with type 2 diabetes. Here we investigate the effect of three common SNPs of FFAR1 (rs2301151; rs16970264; rs1573611) on pancreatic function, BMI, body composition and plasma lipids. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: For this enquiry we used the baseline RISCK data, which provides a cohort of overweight subjects at increased cardiometabolic risk with detailed phenotyping. The key findings were SNPs of the FFAR1 gene region were associated with differences in body composition and lipids, and the effects of the 3 SNPs combined were cumulative on BMI, body composition and total cholesterol. The effects on BMI and body fat were predominantly mediated by rs1573611 (1.06 kg/m(2) higher (P = 0.009) BMI and 1.53% higher (P = 0.002) body fat per C allele). Differences in plasma lipids were also associated with the BMI-increasing allele of rs2301151 including higher total cholesterol (0.2 mmol/L per G allele, P = 0.01) and with the variant A allele of rs16970264 associated with lower total (0.3 mmol/L, P = 0.02) and LDL (0.2 mmol/L, P<0.05) cholesterol, but also with lower HDL-cholesterol (0.09 mmol/L, P<0.05) although the difference was not apparent when controlling for multiple testing. There were no statistically significant effects of the three SNPs on insulin sensitivity or beta cell function.

  "title" : "Mitochondrial fission induces glycolytic reprogramming in cancer-associated myofibroblasts, driving stromal lactate production, and early tumor growth.",
  "description" : "Recent studies have suggested that cancer cells behave as metabolic parasites, by inducing oxidative stress in adjacent normal fibroblasts. More specifically, oncogenic mutations in cancer cells lead to ROS production and the \"secretion\" of hydrogen peroxide species. Oxidative stress in stromal fibroblasts then induces their metabolic conversion into cancer-associated fibroblasts. Such oxidative stress drives the onset of autophagy, mitophagy, and aerobic glycolysis in fibroblasts, resulting in the local production of high-energy mitochondrial fuels (such as L-lactate, ketone bodies, and glutamine). These recycled nutrients are then transferred to cancer cells, where they are efficiently burned via oxidative mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS). We have termed this new energy-transfer mechanism \"Two-Compartment Tumor Metabolism\", to reflect that the production and consumption of nutrients (L-lactate and other catabolites) is highly compartmentalized. Thus, high-energy onco-catabolites are produced by the tumor stroma. Here, we used a genetic approach to stringently test this energy-transfer hypothesis. First, we generated hTERT-immortalized fibroblasts which were genetically re-programmed towards catabolic metabolism. Metabolic re-programming towards glycolytic metabolism was achieved by the recombinant over-expression of MFF (mitochondrial fission factor). MFF over-expression results in extensive mitochondrial fragmentation, driving mitochondrial dysfunction. Our results directly show that MFFfibroblasts undergo oxidative stress, with increased ROS production, and the onset of autophagy and mitophagy, both catabolic processes. Mechanistically, oxidative stress induces autophagy via NF-kB activation, also providing a link with inflammation. As a consequence MFF-fibroblasts showed intracellular ATP depletion and the extracellular secretion of L-lactate, a critical onco-catabolite. MFF-fibroblasts also showed signs of myofibroblast differentiation, with the expression of SMA and calponin. Importantly, MFF-fibroblasts signficantly promoted early tumor growth (up to 6.5-fold), despite a 20% overall reduction in angiogenesis. Thus, catabolic metabolism in cancer-associated fibroblasts may be a critical event during tumor intiation, allowing accelerated tumor growth, especially prior to the onset of neoangiogenesis.",

  "description" : "Three Central European oak species, with four provenances each, were experimentally tested in 16 large model ecosystem chambers for their response to passive air warming (AW, ambient +1–2 °C), drought (D, −43 to −60% irrigation) and their combination (AWD) for 3 years on two forest soil types of pH 4 or 7. Throughout the entire experiment, the influence of the different ambient and experimental climates on the oak trees was strong. The morphological traits of the Quercus species were affected in opposing ways in AW and D treatments, with a neutral effect in the AWD treatment. Biochemical parameters and LMA showed low relative plasticity compared to the morphological and growth parameters. The high plasticity in physiologically important parameters of the three species, such as number of intercalary veins or leaf size, indicated good drought acclimation properties. The soil type influenced leaf chlorophyll concentration, C/N and area more than drought, whereas foliage mass was more dependent on drought than on soil type. Through comparison of visible symptom development with the water deficits, a drought tolerance threshold of −1.3 MPa was determined. Although Q. pubescens had xeromorphic leaf characteristics (small leaf size, lower leaf water content, high LMA, pilosity, more chlorophyll, higher C/N) and less response to the treatments than Q. petraea and Q. robur, it suffered more leaf drought injury and shedding of leaves than Q. petraea. However, if foliage mass were used as the criterion for sustainable performance under a future climate, Q. robur would be the most appropriate species.",

  "description" : "The short QT syndrome (SQTS) is a genetically heterogeneous condition characterized by abbreviated QT intervals and an increased susceptibility to arrhythmia and sudden death. This simulation study identifies arrhythmogenic mechanisms in the rapid-delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Kr))-linked SQT1 variant of the SQTS. Markov chain (MC) models were found to be superior to Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) models in reproducing experimental data regarding effects of the N588K mutation on KCNH2-encoded hERG. These ionic channel models were then incorporated into human ventricular action potential (AP) models and into 1D and 2D idealised and realistic transmural ventricular tissue simulations and into a 3D anatomical model. In single cell models, the N588K mutation abbreviated ventricular cell AP duration at 90% repolarization (APD(90)) and decreased the maximal transmural voltage heterogeneity (δV) during APs. This resulted in decreased transmural heterogeneity of APD(90) and of the effective refractory period (ERP): effects that are anticipated to be anti-arrhythmic rather than pro-arrhythmic. However, with consideration of transmural heterogeneity of I(Kr) density in the intact tissue model based on the ten Tusscher-Noble-Noble-Panfilov ventricular model, not only did the N588K mutation lead to QT-shortening and increases in T-wave amplitude, but δV was found to be augmented in some local regions of ventricle tissue, resulting in increased tissue vulnerability for uni-directional conduction block and predisposing to formation of re-entrant excitation waves. In 2D and 3D tissue models, the N588K mutation facilitated and maintained re-entrant excitation waves due to the reduced substrate size necessary for sustaining re-entry. Thus, in SQT1 the N588K-hERG mutation facilitates initiation and maintenance of ventricular re-entry, increasing the lifespan of re-entrant spiral waves and the stability of scroll waves in 3D tissue.",

  "description" : "With increasing age, dynamic tissues such as lungs, blood vessels and skin lose their ability to both deform and recoil, culminating in tissue stiffening. This loss of tissue elasticity, which profoundly impacts tissue function and thus morbidity, may be due not only to changes in the relative abundance of key extracellular matrix proteins within tissues but also to their accumulation of post-translational modifications. Whilst to date attention has focussed primarily on the age-related non-enzymatic formation of advanced glycation end products, the accumulation of pathological enzyme-mediated cross-links may also lead to age-related tissue stiffening. The lysyl oxidase (LOX) family of enzymes are constitutively expressed in adult tissues and are known to drive the catalysis of cross-links in both fibrillar collagens and elastin. Although immunochemical approaches are commonly used to localise the inactive pro-enzyme of LOX, and biochemical methods are employed to quantify activity in homogenised tissue, they do not allow for the in situ localisation of the enzyme. Thus, we have developed a novel assay to both detect and localise LOX enzyme activity in situ. LOX family members are amine oxidases and this assay uses the principle that an amine substrate in the presence of this class of enzyme will be oxidised to an aldehyde and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In turn, H2O2, when combined with luminol and horseradish peroxidase, will produce a light-emitting reaction that can be detected by film autoradiography. The development of a technique to localise specific amine oxidase activity in tissue sections may provide crucial additional information on the exact role played by this class of enzymes in mediating age-related tissue stiffening.",

  "description" : "Human native milk lactoferrin (LF) and recombinant forms of lactoferrin (rLF) are available with identical aa sequences, but different glycosylation patterns. Native lactoferrin (NLF) possesses the intrinsic ability to stimulate vigorous IgG and IgE antibody responses in BALB/c mice, whereas recombinant forms (Aspergillus or rice) are 40-fold less immunogenic and 200-fold less allergenic. Such differences are independent of endotoxin or iron content and the glycans do not contribute to epitope formation. A complex glycoprofile is observed for NLF, including sialic acid, fucose, mannose and Lewis (Le)(x) structures, whereas both rLF species display a simpler glycoprofile rich in mannose. Although Le(x) type sugars play a Th2-type adjuvant role, endogenous expression of Le(x) on NLF did not completely account for the more vigorous IgE responses it provoked.

  "texts" : [ "Differential immunogenicity and allergenicity of native and recombinant human lactoferrins: Role of glycosylation.", "Human native milk lactoferrin (LF) and recombinant forms of lactoferrin (rLF) are available with identical aa sequences, but different glycosylation patterns. Native lactoferrin (NLF) possesses the intrinsic ability to stimulate vigorous IgG and IgE antibody responses in BALB/c mice, whereas recombinant forms (Aspergillus or rice) are 40-fold less immunogenic and 200-fold less allergenic. Such differences are independent of endotoxin or iron content and the glycans do not contribute to epitope formation. A complex glycoprofile is observed for NLF, including sialic acid, fucose, mannose and Lewis (Le)(x) structures, whereas both rLF species display a simpler glycoprofile rich in mannose. Although Le(x) type sugars play a Th2-type adjuvant role, endogenous expression of Le(x) on NLF did not completely account for the more vigorous IgE responses it provoked. Furthermore, co-adminstration of rLF down-regulated IgE and up-regulated IgG2a antibody responses provoked by NLF, but was without effect on responses to unrelated peanut and chicken egg allergens.

  "description" : "Background: Gene expression studies increasingly compare expression responses between different experimental backgrounds (genetic, physiological, or phylogenetic). By focusing on dynamic responses rather than a direct comparison of static expression levels, this type of study allows a finer dissection of primary and secondary regulatory effects in the various backgrounds. Usually, results of such experiments are presented in the form of Venn diagrams, which are intuitive and visually appealing, but lack a statistical foundation. Results: Here we introduce Vector Analysis (VA) as a simple, yet principled, approach to comparing expression responses in different experimental backgrounds. VA enables the automatic assignment of genes to response prototypes and provides statistical significance estimates to eliminate spurious response patterns. The application of VA to a real dataset, comparing nutrient starvation responses in wild type and mutant Arabidopsis plants, reveals that consistent patterns of expression behavior are present in the data and are reliably detected by the algorithm. Conclusion: Vector analysis is a flexible, easy-to-use technique to compare gene expression patterns in different experimental backgrounds. It compares favorably with the classical Venn diagram approach and can be implemented manually using spreadsheets, such as Excel, or automatically by using the supplied software. ?? 2005 Breitling et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",

This argument indicates that, for this case, the qualitative behavior of rotation number depends linearly on a. It is also shown that the length of the rotation interval, when the transition from a trivial rotation interval (invertible case) to a non-trivial rotation interval occurs, it develops locally as a universal unfolding.A different map, piecewise monotone, and structurally similar to the maps defined to calculate the edges of rotation intervals in Boyland (1986), is studied to illustrate how the rotation number grows.

  "title" : "The lofting of Western Pacific regional aerosol by island thermodynamics as observed around Borneo",
  "description" : "Vertical profiles of aerosol chemical composition, number concentration and size were measured throughout the lower troposphere of Borneo, a large tropical island in the western Pacific Ocean. Aerosol composition, size and number concentration measurements (using an Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer, Passive Cavity Aerosol Spectrometer Probe and Condensation Particle Counter, respectively) were made both upwind and downwind of Borneo, as well as over the island itself, on board the UK BAe-146 research aircraft as part of the OP3 project. Two meteorological regimes were identified - one dominated by isolated terrestrial convection (ITC) which peaked in the afternoon, and the other characterised by more regionally active mesoscale convective systems (MCS). Upwind profiles show aerosol to be confined to a shallow marine boundary layer below 930 +/- 10 hPa (similar to 760 m above sea level, a.s.l.). As this air mass advects over the island with the mean free troposphere synoptic flow during the ITC-dominated regime, it is convectively lofted above the terrestrial surface mixed layer to heights of between 945 +/- 22 (similar to 630 m a.s.l.) and 740 +/- 44 hPa (similar to 2740 m a.s.l.), consistent with a coupling between the synoptic steering level flow and island sea breeze circulations. Terrestrial aerosol was observed to be lofted into this higher layer through both moist convective uplift and transport through turbulent diurnal sea-breeze cells. At the peak of convective activity in the mid-afternoons, organic aerosol loadings in the lofted layer were observed to be substantially higher than in the morning (by a mean factor of three). This organic matter is dominated by secondary aerosol from processing of biogenic gas phase precursors. Aerosol number concentration profiles suggest formation of new particles aloft in the atmosphere. By the time the air mass reaches the west coast of the island, terrestrial aerosol is enhanced in the lofted layer. Such uplift of aerosol in Borneo is expected to increase aerosol lifetimes in the lower free troposphere downwind, as they are above the boundary layer and therefore less likely to be lost by wet or dry deposition. It is also likely to change the role they play in the semi-direct and direct aerosol effects. The long chain of islands extending from Malaysia to Australia may all similarly be expected to present an orographic barrier to low level mean flow. This would lead to significant transport of aerosol into the tropical free troposphere across the Western Pacific region.",

  "description" : "The mechanism known as Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), which is perhaps the most established mechanism associated with memory and learning, describes the Hebbian postulate that “neurons that fire together, wire together”.  LTP refers to the upregulation of synaptic strength in response to high activity and can be subdivided into distinct phases.  Early-LTP involves the phosphorylation of neurotransmitter receptors while Late-LTP involves the increase in expression of receptors at the postsynaptic membrane.  These are long-term, stable perturbations of synaptic activity, lasting from hours to weeks.  However, more subtle mechanisms controlling shorter-term plastic changes in synaptic function lie in the spatial distribution of postsynaptic receptors.  In glutamatergic synapses within the mammalian CNS the distribution of neurotransmitter receptors is controlled by a scaffold of proteins under the postsynaptic membrane known as the PostSynaptic Density (PSD). This complex has been observed to change shape on a rapid scale, however little is understood about its macromolecular structure.The PSD anchors glutamate receptors within the postsynaptic membrane along with metabotropic receptors and cytoplasmic enzymes that modulate synaptic function and PSD and dendritic spine morphology.  Much of what is understood on the macro-molecular structure of the PSD is based on knowledge of known binding partners.  A recent paper within the group presented the PSD-95-Kir2.1 sub-complex of the PSD using a multi-disciplinary structural approach, blending Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and solution scattering models with high-resolution X-ray and NMR structures for individual folded domains.  In this thesis the solution state structure of PSD-95 is examined more closely.  Deletion constructs of PSD-95 have been obtained by expressing subcloned fragments of the gene from Homo sapiens in an E. coli expression system and purifying them through a combination of IMAC, ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration.  The PDZ region is rigorously described using Small Angle X-ray Scattering and is orthogonally validated by comparing the models against hydrodynamic data for the constructs.  The PDZ12 region was crystallized and subjected to extensive optimisation to improve the resulting diffraction, falling just short of a molecular replacement structure.  Attempts were made to crystallize the PDZ3 domain with the K¬ir¬2.1 C-terminus.  PSD-95 dynamics was also investigated using Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (DXMS) to test a hypothesis for an internal binding interaction but was found not to be present using the methods developed.",

We study Leishmania donovani parasites isolated from visceral leishmaniasis patients in Nepal that responded differently to antimonial treatment due to differing intrinsic drug sensitivity of the parasites. Here, we present a proof-of-principle study in which we applied a metabolomics pipeline specifically developed for L. donovani to characterize the global metabolic differences between antimonial-sensitive and antimonial-resistant L. donovani isolates. Clones of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant parasite isolates from clinical samples were cultured in vitro and harvested for metabolomics analysis. The relative abundance of 340 metabolites was determined by {ZIC-HILIC} chromatography coupled to {LTQ-Orbitrap} mass spectrometry. Our measurements cover approximately 20\\% of the predicted core metabolome of Leishmania and additionally detected a large number of lipids. Drug-sensitive and drug-resistant parasites showed distinct metabolic profiles, and unsupervised clustering and principal component analysis clearly distinguished the two phenotypes. For 100 metabolites, the detected intensity differed more than three-fold between the 2 phenotypes. Many of these were in specific areas of lipid metabolism, suggesting that the membrane composition of the drug-resistant parasites is extensively modified. Untargeted metabolomics has been applied on clinical Leishmania isolates to uncover major metabolic differences between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant isolates.

  "description" : "Cancer cells do not exist as pure homogeneous populations in vivo. Instead they are embedded in \"cancer cell nests\" that are surrounded by stromal cells, especially cancer associated fibroblasts. Thus, it is not unreasonable to suspect that stromal fibroblasts could influence the metabolism of adjacent cancer cells, and visa versa. In accordance with this idea, we have recently proposed that the Warburg effect in cancer cells may be due to culturing cancer cells by themselves, out of their normal stromal context or tumor microenvironment. In fact, when cancer cells are co-cultured with fibroblasts, then cancer cells increase their mitochondrial mass, while fibroblasts lose their mitochondria. An in depth analysis of this phenomenon reveals that aggressive cancer cells are \"parasites\" that use oxidative stress as a \"weapon\" to extract nutrients from surrounding stromal cells. Oxidative stress in fibroblasts induces the autophagic destruction of mitochondria, by mitophagy. Then, stromal cells are forced to undergo aerobic glycolysis, and produce energy-rich nutrients (such as lactate and ketones) to \"feed\" cancer cells. This mechanism would allow cancer cells to seed anywhere, without blood vessels as a food source, as they could simply induce oxidative stress wherever they go, explaining how cancer cells survive during metastasis. We suggest that stromal catabolism, via autophagy and mitophagy, fuels the anabolic growth of tumor cells, promoting tumor progression and metastasis. We have previously termed this new paradigm \"The Autophagic Tumor Stroma Model of Cancer Metabolism\", or the \"Reverse Warburg Effect\". We also discuss how glutamine addiction (glutaminolysis) in cancer cells fits well with this new model, by promoting oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in aggressive cancer cells.",

  "title" : "CHARACTERISATION OF CYTOCHROME P450 AZOLE DRUG-RESISTANT STEROL DEMETHYLASE CYP51B1 AND EXPRESSION OF CYP123 AND CYP136 FROM MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS",
  "description" : "Tuberculosis (TB) affects nearly a third of the world’s population and has been termed a ‘Global Emergency’ by the WHO. The emergence of multi/extensively drug resistant (M/XDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of TB, and the increasing incidences of azole drug resistant sterol demethylases (CYP51) from pathogenic fungi has propelled studies to understand mechanisms of azole drug resistance on the drug target CYP51. Since Mtb is devoid of a sterol biosynthetic pathway, the presence and study of CYP51B1 and 19 other Cytochrome P450s in its genome is important to clarify host-pathogen mechanism of infection and the potential of using azole drugs to treat TB. In this study, CYP51B1 from Mtb was used as the model enzyme to study CYP51 mutants from Candida albicans fluconazole-resistant clinical strains. By protein engineering methods, F89H, L100F, S348F, G388S and R391K CYP51B1 mutants were made and azole drug binding properties were investigated using stopped-flow kinetics and static equilibrium methods. Dissociation constant (Kd) values were derived for a range of commercially available azole drugs by fitting the equilibrium binding data to a hyperbolic equation. Kd values for stopped-flow kinetics were derived by plotting observed binding rates (kobs) across different azole drug concentrations against time, followed by fitting multiple kobs data to a linear equation to derive azole drug de-binding (koff) and binding (kon) rate constants – the Kd was obtained by koff/kon. Extinction coefficient for heme b content in mutants and Wild Type (WT) CYP51B1 were an average of ɛ419 = 96.1 mM-1 cm-1. Biochemical characterisation of the mutants were carried out using established experiments on CYP51 – reduction of Fe(III)-heme to Fe(II)-heme, NO binding to Fe(III)-heme, rates of CO-Fe(II) adduct formation and rates of collapse of the P450 to P420 species in the presence of CO and estriol with redox partners from Mtb. In order to elucidate the effects of the above mutations on the iron-heme catalytic region, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments were carried out with and without azole drugs. Circular dichroism (CD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and multi-angled laser light scattering (MALLS) analysis confirmed that F89H, R391K and L100F mutants were stable and homogeneous. Crystallogenesis was successful for the above mentioned mutants and atomic structures were obtained for all mutants and WT CYP51B1 (in ligand-bound and substrate-free forms), except for S348F and G388S mutants which were expressed as inclusion bodies and 60% holoenzyme, respectively. Reconstituted catalytic assays to determine the sterol demethylating propensity of the mutants were carried out using redox partners from Mtb or E. coli, and with lanosterol and dihydrolanosterol as the surrogate substrates. Redox potentiometry showed similar potentials to WT for all mutants except for the G388S mutant which was relatively positive (–102 mV). Redox cycling experiments followed by EPR analysis for mutants and WT resulted in a novel P450 high-spin species at g value 5.84 (80 %) which gradually collapsed to the initial low spin state over 48 h. Expression trials were concurrently carried out on two other Mtb P450 genes – CYP123 (Rv0744c) and CYP136 (Rv3059) products of which may have similar functions to CYP51B1 or may share similar redox partners. CYP123 is located on the same operon as CYP51B1 while CYP136 has a 29% sequence identity to another CYP51 from a marine slime bacterium. Although further work is necessary, in this study CYP123 was expressed totally as inclusion bodies while CYP136 was expressed as soluble apoprotein fused with trigger factor chaperone.",

  "title" : "Characterisation of Impact Damage in Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastics by 3D X-Ray Tomography",
  "description" : "Carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP's) are finding increased used as structural materials in many transport applications, particularly next generation commercial aircraft. The impact damage tolerance of these materials is relatively poor compared to conventional aircraft materials such as aluminium. As a result there is a concerted research effort to improve the damage tolerance of these materials.   Understanding the microstructural mechanisms of damage can help to design improved materials. Three-dimensional X-Ray computed tomography (CT) allows these damage mechanisms to be identified and quantified non-destructively. However, a lack of published work in the field means no consistent methodologies for imaging or quantifying damage in CFRP's using X-Ray tomography exist.   This thesis provides several novel methodologies for imaging and quantifying impact damage using X-Ray CT.    A dual energy imaging methodology was developed to overcome the reduction in CT image quality caused by the high aspect ratio of CFRP structures. This approach resulted in a 66% increase in signal-to-noise ratio, and a 109% increase in contrast-to-noise ratio.   The development of a methodology for quantifying impact damage in CFRP based on thresholding the in-plane damage area showed good agreement with ultrasonic C-scan results, and allowed correlations between impact energy, damage area and compression-after-strength to be made.    Region of interest (ROI) algorithms for high magnification imaging of impact damage in CFRP plates were investigated. These algorithms were not developed by the author, but further understanding of their effectiveness and practical applications is presented in this work.        Finally, a novel X-Ray tomographic imaging technique using interferometry was applied to imaging impact damage in CFRP's. This method was developed by a research group in Switzerland at the \\emph{Centre Suisse d'Electronique et de Microtechnique} (CSEM) in Zurich. The work in this thesis presents the first application of the technique to image impact damage in CFRP.",

The impact damage tolerance of these materials is relatively poor compared to conventional aircraft materials such as aluminium. As a result there is a concerted research effort to improve the damage tolerance of these materials.   Understanding the microstructural mechanisms of damage can help to design improved materials. Three-dimensional X-Ray computed tomography (CT) allows these damage mechanisms to be identified and quantified non-destructively. However, a lack of published work in the field means no consistent methodologies for imaging or quantifying damage in CFRP's using X-Ray tomography exist.   This thesis provides several novel methodologies for imaging and quantifying impact damage using X-Ray CT.    A dual energy imaging methodology was developed to overcome the reduction in CT image quality caused by the high aspect ratio of CFRP structures. This approach resulted in a 66% increase in signal-to-noise ratio, and a 109% increase in contrast-to-noise ratio.   The development of a methodology for quantifying impact damage in CFRP based on thresholding the in-plane damage area showed good agreement with ultrasonic C-scan results, and allowed correlations between impact energy, damage area and compression-after-strength to be made.    Region of interest (ROI) algorithms for high magnification imaging of impact damage in CFRP plates were investigated. These algorithms were not developed by the author, but further understanding of their effectiveness and practical applications is presented in this work.        Finally, a novel X-Ray tomographic imaging technique using interferometry was applied to imaging impact damage in CFRP's. This method was developed by a research group in Switzerland at the \\emph{Centre Suisse d'Electronique et de Microtechnique} (CSEM) in Zurich. The work in this thesis presents the first application of the technique to image impact damage in CFRP.", null ],

  "description" : "Inert gas washout tests, performed using the single or multiple breath washout technique (SBW and MBW, respectively), were first described over 60 years ago. As measures of ventilation distribution inhomogeneity, they offer complementary information to standard lung function tests such as spirometry as well as improved feasibility across wider age ranges and improved sensitivity in the detection of early lung damage. These benefits have led to a resurgence of interest in these techniques from manufacturers, clinicians and researchers, yet detailed guidelines for washout equipment specifications, test performance and analysis are lacking. This manuscript provides recommendations about these aspects, applicable to both the paediatric and adult testing environment, whilst outlining the important principles that are essential for the reader to understand. These recommendations are evidence-based where possible but in many places represent expert opinion from a working group with a large collective experience in the techniques discussed. Finally, the important issues that remain unanswered are highlighted. By addressing these important issues and directing future research, the hope is to facilitate the incorporation of these promising tests into routine clinical practice.",

  "description" : "This article reviews the consequences of the need for the cardiac cell to be in calcium flux balance in the steady state. We first discuss how this steady state condition affects the control of resting [Ca(2+)]i. The next section considers how sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca content is controlled by a feedback mechanism whereby changes of SR Ca affect the amplitude of the Ca transient and this, in turn, controls sarcolemmal Ca fluxes. Subsequent sections review the effects of altering the activity of individual Ca handling proteins. Increasing the activity of the SR Ca-ATPase (SERCA) increases both the amplitude and rate constant of decay of the systolic Ca transient. The Ca flux balance condition requires that this must be achieved with no change of Ca efflux placing constraints on the magnitude of change of amplitude and decay rate. We analyze the quantitative dependence of Ca transient amplitude and SR content on SERCA activity. Increasing the open probability of the RyR during systole is predicted to have no steady state effect on the amplitude of the systolic Ca transient. We discuss the effects of changing the amplitude of the L-type Ca current in the context of both triggering Ca release from the SR and loading the cell with calcium.

  "description" : "We have isolated and studied the genes involved in the alanylation step in the biosynthesis of a herbicide, bialaphos which is produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus. Three bialaphos-nonproducing mutants, NP60, NP61 and NP62, isolated from S. hygroscopicus by treatment with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine were defective for the alanylation step and were not restored to productivity by any locus of the gene cluster previously cloned. Three plasmids were isolated using NP60, NP61 and NP62 as recipients. The genes which restored productivity to NP61 and NP62 hybridized to the contiguous region of the bialaphos biosynthetic gene cluster. The gene cluster involved in the bialaphos production was about 35 kb long. The gene which restored productivity to NP60 did not hybridize to the bialaphos biosynthetic gene cluster. VM3 and VM4, putative alanylation blocked mutants, were derived from a bialaphos producer by gene replacement of an unidentified region of the biosynthetic gene cluster with an in vitro altered DNA sequence. The genes which restored productivity to VM3 and VM4 were located between the genes which code for phosphinomethylmalic acid synthetase and demethylphosphinothricin acetyltransferase in the cluster.

This task is complicated by the noisiness of the data and the large number of genes that are examined simultaneously. Here, we present a novel technique for identifying differentially expressed genes that does not originate from a sophisticated statistical model but rather from an analysis of biological reasoning. The new technique, which is based on calculating rank products (RP) from replicate experiments, is fast and simple. At the same time, it provides a straightforward and statistically stringent way to determine the significance level for each gene and allows for the flexible control of the false-detection rate and familywise error rate in the multiple testing situation of a microarray experiment. We use the RP technique on three biological data sets and show that in each case it performs more reliably and consistently than the non-parametric t-test variant implemented in Tusher et al.'s significance analysis of microarrays (SAM). We also show that the RP results are reliable in highly noisy data. An analysis of the physiological function of the identified genes indicates that the RP approach is powerful for identifying biologically relevant expression changes.

The hybrid receptor is functional in normal hematopoietic progenitors in which both subunits control STAT5 activation.

  "description" : "Intrinsic ageing of the skin is a subtle process resulting in some degree of skin laxity. The dermal elastic fibre network imbues skin with the capacity to recoil and loss of this property contributes to an aged, wrinkled appearance. Whilst elastic fibres have a complex, composite structure which allows them to fulfil multiple roles, the effects of intrinsic ageing on their discrete molecular components has not previously been explored. In this study, we have used a microarray-based approach to perform a novel survey of the changes in gene expression that occur in components of cutaneous elastic fibres as a result of intrinsic ageing. Age-related changes in gene expression were validated at the mRNA and protein levels using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunostaining, respectively. The microarray revealed that the majority of elastic fibre network components were unchanged with age. However, three differentially expressed genes were identified: latent TGFβ-binding protein (LTBP)-2 which was up-regulated with age (fold change +1.58, P = 0.041); LTBP3 (fold change -1.67, P = 0.025) and the lysyl oxidase-like enzyme (LOXL1, fold change -1.47, P = 0.008) which were both down-regulated with age. Although the changes in gene expression for LTBP3 were not confirmed by either qPCR or immunostaining, the expression and tissue deposition of both LTBP2 and LOXL1 were significantly enhanced in intrinsically aged skin. Whilst the functional implications of these altered expression profiles remains to be elucidated, LTBP2 and LOXL1 are thought to play important roles in controlling and maintaining elastic fibre deposition, assembly and structure via binding to fibulin-5. Consequently, any age-related perturbations in the expression of these components may have important consequences on remodelling of the extracellular matrix and hence on the mechanical properties of intrinsically aged skin.",

The plasma membrane calcium ATPase 2 (PMCA2) has been recently identified as a negative regulator of apoptosis that can play a significant role in cancer progression by conferring cells resistance to apoptosis. We have previously reported an inhibitory interaction between PMCA2 and the calcium-activated signalling molecule calcineurin in breast cancer cells. Here, we demonstrate that disruption of the PMCA2/calcineurin interaction in a variety of human breast cancer cells results in activation of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway, upregulation in the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Fas Ligand and in a concomitant loss of cell viability. Reduction in cell viability is the consequence of an increase in cell apoptosis. Impairment of the PMCA2/calcineurin interaction enhances paclitaxel-mediated cytotoxicity of breast tumoral cells. Our results suggest that therapeutic modulation of the PMCA2/calcineurin interaction might have important clinical applications to improve current treatments for breast cancer patients.",

  "description" : "The chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan (CSPG) versican forms complexes with hyaluronan (HA), which are essential in a range of functions including cellular proliferation and migration. Four isoforms of versican result from alternative splicing. Furthermore, biological roles have been identified for the proteolytic cleavage product of versican which contains the N-terminal G1 hyaluronan binding domain. All of these versican forms have different tightly regulated tissue expression profiles. Consequently, impaired regulation is associated with a number of disease pathologies. For example the largest variants (V0/V1) have been shown to be negative indicators of disease outcome in a number of malignant cancers and are a marker of disease progression in atherosclerosis. Interestingly, the smaller versican isoform V3 which lacks CS chains has been demonstrated to have the potential to reverse disease associated phenotypes. The motivation for carrying out the work in this thesis was to try and gain a better understanding of how versican functions on a molecular scale. In this regard, the first aim was to investigate the structure of the hyaluronan binding region of versican using a construct called VG1. The structure of VG1 was analysed in the presence and absence of hyaluronan oligomers. This revealed an insight into the multi-modular structure of the versican hyaluronan binding region and demonstrated that on binding to HA, VG1 under goes a conformational change. Furthermore, the interaction between VG1 and longer lengths of hyaluronan (pHA) was investigated. This demonstrated that when VG1 binds to pHA it is does so with positive cooperativity, packing very close to neighbouring VG1 molecules along a chain of HA. One consequence of this interaction was to reorganise pHA into a helical conformation, an organisation that was confirmed by a number of solution phase techniques. The effect of this reorganisation of pHA by VG1 on HA/CD44 interactions was also assessed. Previously the interaction between CD44 (a cell surface hyaluronan receptor) and long chains of HA (>30 kDa) was shown to be irreversible; however we demonstrate that VG1 can reverse this. Furthermore, a TSG-6 enhanced CD44/interaction was also completely reversed by the addition of VG1.  This provides an indication that a functional hierarchy of hyaluronan binding proteins may exist which could have important implications in understanding the function of hyaluronan complexes.Currently, we do not know whether intact versican molecules could interact with HA in the same way as VG1. However, preliminary data suggests that the CS-containing variants (i.e. V0, V1 and V2) would not, whereas V3 and versican fragments could.

  "description" : "Here, we show that functional loss of a single gene is sufficient to confer constitutive milk protein production and protection against mammary tumor formation. Caveolin-3 (Cav-3), a muscle-specific caveolin-related gene, is highly expressed in muscle cells. We demonstrate that Cav-3 is also expressed in myoepithelial cells within the mammary gland. To determine whether genetic ablation of Cav-3 expression affects adult mammary gland development, we studied the phenotype(s) of Cav-3(-/-)-null mice. Interestingly, Cav-3(-/-) virgin mammary glands developed lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia, akin to the changes normally observed during pregnancy and lactation. Genome-wide expression profiling revealed up-regulation of gene transcripts associated with pregnancy/lactation, mammary stem cells, and human breast cancers, consistent with a constitutive lactogenic phenotype. Expression levels of three key transcriptional regulators of lactation, namely Elf5, Stat5a, and c-Myc, were also significantly elevated. Experiments with pregnant mice directly showed that Cav-3(-/-) mice underwent precocious lactation. Finally, using orthotopic tumor cell implantation, we demonstrated that virgin Cav-3(-/-) mice were dramatically protected against mammary tumor formation. Thus, Cav-3(-/-) mice are a novel preclinical model to study the protective effects of a lactogenic microenvironment on mammary tumor onset and progression. Our current studies have broad implications for using the lactogenic microenvironment as a paradigm to discover new therapies for the prevention and/or treatment of human breast cancers.",

  "description" : "Technetium is a long lived (2.13 x 10(5) a), beta emitting radionuclide which is a groundwater contaminant at a number of nuclear facilities throughout the world. Its environmental behaviour is primarily governed by its redox state. Under oxic conditions it forms the highly soluble pertechnetate (TcO4-) ion; under reducing conditions it forms the poorly soluble, reduced forms of Tc, particularly the Tc(IV) ion which is expected to precipitate as hydrous TcO2 above its solubility limit (10(-9) mol l(-1) at similar to pH 7) or to be strongly sorbed to mineral surfaces at lower concentrations. Thus the redox cycling behaviour of Tc is predicted to be key to its environmental behaviour in the natural and engineered environment. Here the results of a series of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments which examine the oxidation state and coordination environment of Tc in a range of estuarine, aquifer and freshwater sediment suspensions, and in an environmentally relevant amorphous Fe(II) phase under both reduced and reoxidised biogeochemical conditions are presented. In reduced sediments and the amorphous Fe(II) phase prior to reoxidation, XAS results show that Tc was retained as hydrous TcO2-like phases across all samples. Under air reoxidation, experiments showed significant (up to 80\\%) remobilisation of Tc to solution as TcO4-. In pre-reduced freshwater sediments, aquifer sediments and the amorphous Fe(II) phase oxidised with air, XAS indicated that Tc remained associated with the solids as hydrous TcO2-like phases. By contrast, in air reoxidised estuarine sediment XAS analysis suggested that both hydrous TcO2-like phases and TcO4 were retained within the sediment. Finally, when microbial ly-mediated NO3 reoxidation occurred in estuarine and aquifer sediment slurries, experiments showed comparatively low (<8\\%) remobilisation of Tc from solids over similar timescales to air reoxidation experiments, whilst XAS again showed that both hydrous TcO2-like phases and TcO4 were retained within the sediment. By contrast, in the amorphous Fe(II) phase, although NO3 reoxidation again led to low (<4\\%) remobilisation of Tc from solids, XAS analysis showed that Tc was retained as hydrous TcO2-like phases alone. These results are discussed in the context of the redox cycling behaviour of Tc in the natural and engineered environment. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

  "description" : "The complement system is an important component of the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae. The classical complement pathway is activated by antibody-antigen complexes on the bacterial surface and has been considered predominately to be an effector of the adaptive immune response, whereas the alternative and mannose-binding lectin pathways are activated directly by bacterial cell surface components and are considered effectors of the innate immune response. Recently, a role has been suggested for the classical pathway during innate immunity that is activated by natural IgM or components of the acute-phase response bound to bacterial pathogens. However, the functional importance of the classical pathway for innate immunity to S. pneumoniae and other bacterial pathogens, and its relative contribution compared with the alternative and mannose-binding lectin pathways has not been defined. By using strains of mice with genetic deficiencies of complement components and secretory IgM we have investigated the role of each complement pathway and natural IgM for innate immunity to S. pneumoniae. Our results show that the proportion of a population of S. pneumoniae bound by C3 depends mainly on the classical pathway, whereas the intensity of C3 binding depends on the alternative pathway. Furthermore, the classical pathway, partially targeted by the binding of natural IgM to bacteria, is the dominant pathway for activation of the complement system during innate immunity to S. pneumoniae, loss of which results in rapidly progressing septicemia and impaired macrophage activation.

  "description" : "It is important to understand the relative contribution of primary and secondary particles to regional and global aerosol so that models can attribute aerosol radiative forcing to different sources. In large-scale models, there is considerable uncertainty associated with treatments of particle formation (nucleation) in the boundary layer (BL) and in the size distribution of emitted primary particles, leading to uncertainties in predicted cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations. Here we quantify how primary particle emissions and secondary particle formation influence size-resolved particle number concentrations in the BL using a global aerosol microphysics model and aircraft and ground site observations made during the May 2008 campaign of the European Integrated Project on Aerosol Cloud Climate Air Quality Interactions (EUCAARI). We tested four different parameterisations for BL nucleation and two assumptions for the emission size distribution of anthropogenic and wildfire carbonaceous particles. When we emit carbonaceous particles at small sizes (as recommended by the Aerosol Inter-comparison project, AEROCOM), the spatial distributions of campaign-mean number concentrations of particles with diameter >50 nm (N-50) and >100 nm (N-100) were well captured by the model (R-2 >= 0.8) and the normalised mean bias (NMB) was also small (-18\\% for N-50 and -1\\% for N-100). Emission of carbonaceous particles at larger sizes, which we consider to be more realistic for low spatial resolution global models, results in equally good correlation but larger bias (R-2 >= 0.8, NMB = -52\\% and -29\\%), which could be partly but not entirely compensated by BL nucleation. Within the uncertainty of the observations and accounting for the uncertainty in the size of emitted primary particles, BL nucleation makes a statistically significant contribution to CCN-sized particles at less than a quarter of the ground sites. Our results show that a major source of uncertainty in CCN-sized particles in polluted European air is the emitted size of primary carbonaceous particles. New information is required not just from direct observations, but also to determine the ``effective emission size{''} and composition of primary particles appropriate for different resolution models.",

In addition to carrying mechanical loads, smart structures may alleviate vibration, reduce acoustic noise, change their mechanical properties as required or monitor their own condition. With the last point in mind, this article examines the scattering of flexural waves by a semi-infinite crack in a non-ferrous thin plate that is subjected to a constant current aligned in the direction of the crack edge. The aim is to investigate whether the current can be used to detect or inhibit the onset of crack growth. The model problem is amenable to an exact solution via the Wiener-Hopf technique, which enables an explicit analysis of the bending (and twisting) moment intensity factors at the crack tip, and also the diffracted field. The latter contains an edge wave component, and its amplitude is determined explicitly in terms of the current and angle of incidence of the forcing flexural wave. It is further observed that the edge wave phase speed exhibits a dual dependence on frequency and current, resulting in two distinct asymptotic behaviours.",

  "description" : "Innate immune cells including macrophages, dendritic cells, and granulocytes are resident within or patrol very different microenvironments in the host. Their activity or responsiveness to antigen is dictated by site-specific factors. Because of the constant exposure to environmental antigens and commensal microorganisms, mucosal immunity needs to be more constrained than peripheral counterparts to prevent unnecessary inflammation. The epithelial surfaces that dominate all mucosal tissues provide an ideal regulator since innate immune cells are often in intimate contact with, or lie immediately beneath, them and a breach in epithelial integrity would signal a damaging event and release innate immunity from their influence. We discuss the role of the respiratory epithelium in raising the threshold of innate immune cell activation at homoeostasis, how its absence triggers innate immunity, and how inflammatory resolution often produces an altered homoeostatic environment that can affect the next inflammatory event at this site.",

  "description" : "In the Drosophila embryo, formation of a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) morphogen gradient requires transport of a heterodimer of the BMPs Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and Screw (Scw) in a protein shuttling complex. Although the core components of the shuttling complex--Short Gastrulation (Sog) and Twisted Gastrulation (Tsg)--have been identified, key aspects of this shuttling system remain mechanistically unresolved. Recently, we discovered that the extracellular matrix protein collagen IV is important for BMP gradient formation. Here, we formulate a molecular mechanism of BMP shuttling that is catalyzed by collagen IV. We show that Dpp is the only BMP ligand in Drosophila that binds collagen IV. A collagen IV binding-deficient Dpp mutant signals at longer range in vivo, indicating that collagen IV functions to immobilize free Dpp in the embryo. We also provide in vivo evidence that collagen IV functions as a scaffold to promote shuttling complex assembly in a multistep process. After binding of Dpp/Scw and Sog to collagen IV, protein interactions are remodeled, generating an intermediate complex in which Dpp/Scw-Sog is poised for release by Tsg through specific disruption of a collagen IV-Sog interaction. Because all components are evolutionarily conserved, we propose that regulation of BMP shuttling and immobilization through extracellular matrix interactions is widely used, both during development and in tissue homeostasis, to achieve a precise extracellular BMP distribution.",

  "description" : "BACKGROUND: Pruritus, or itch, is the most prevalent symptom of allergic and inflammatory skin disease. Although it is known that itch induces activation of a neural network in the brain, the temporal dynamics of the network as well as the pathophysiology and neurobiology are not well understood. OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to elucidate (i) the temporal dynamics of the itch response identified in earlier studies and (ii) the relationship between central and subjective responses to itch. METHODS: Using a novel time-series analysis, we performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, within-subject functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of the cerebral processing of histamine-induced itch in healthy volunteers (n = 16) by tracking the 8-min period following a single skin prick. RESULTS: Histamine-induced itch compared with saline resulted in significant area under the curve blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal changes in the middle/superior temporal gyrus and right inferior frontal gyrus/insula. We observed negative itch-induced BOLD signal changes compared with saline in (i) the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)/medial frontal gyrus, (ii) subgenual ACC/ventral striatum, (iii) bilateral temporal pole/parahippocampal gyrus and (iv) several regions within the cerebellum. We noted a trend significance in the left precentral gyrus part of the motor cortex. The BOLD signal change in several of these regions correlated with perception of itch intensity. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to other fMRI studies we observed a multifocal negative signal. An improved understanding of both activated and deactivated brain regions during the itch response may in the long term facilitate development of more effective management strategies.",

METHODS: Using a novel time-series analysis, we performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, within-subject functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of the cerebral processing of histamine-induced itch in healthy volunteers (n = 16) by tracking the 8-min period following a single skin prick. RESULTS: Histamine-induced itch compared with saline resulted in significant area under the curve blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal changes in the middle/superior temporal gyrus and right inferior frontal gyrus/insula. We observed negative itch-induced BOLD signal changes compared with saline in (i) the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)/medial frontal gyrus, (ii) subgenual ACC/ventral striatum, (iii) bilateral temporal pole/parahippocampal gyrus and (iv) several regions within the cerebellum. We noted a trend significance in the left precentral gyrus part of the motor cortex. The BOLD signal change in several of these regions correlated with perception of itch intensity. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to other fMRI studies we observed a multifocal negative signal. An improved understanding of both activated and deactivated brain regions during the itch response may in the long term facilitate development of more effective management strategies.", null ],

  "description" : "Remodelling of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins as a result of solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure plays a key role in skin photoageing. We have recently demonstrated that UVR-chromophore-rich fibrillin microfibrils undergo photodegradation following UV irradiation in a cell-free environment. In this study, we test the hypotheses that fibrillin microfibril degradation following UVR exposure: i) occurs via the photodynamic production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and; ii) alters the susceptibility of resultant microfibril photoproducts to protease-mediated degradation.   Fibrillin microfibrils were isolated from cultured human dermal fibroblasts. Microfibril structure after UVB irradiation (Phillips TL-12 source; 500mJ/cm2) in ambient and O2-depleted conditions or after treatment with H2O2 (40mM; up to 2hrs) was quantified by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The effect of UVB irradiation (50mJ/cm2) on the susceptibility of microfibrils to MMP-3 proteolysis was also quantified by AFM.   In ambient oxygen, UVB irradiation caused a dose-dependent decrease in median fibrillin microfibril flexion angle. However, in an O2-depleted environment the UVB mediated effects were significantly abrogated. Structural changes were mimicked by exposure to H2O2.    Individually, UVB or MMP-3 significantly decreased the median microfibril flexion angle. However, addition of MMP-3 to UVB irradiated microfibrils appeared to selectively degrade low flexion angle fibrillin microfibrils leaving a population with a median flexion angle that was not significantly different to the controls.   These observations suggest that UVB degradation involves the photodynamic formation of ROS and that exposure to H2O2 can mimic the effects of UVB degradation.

  "description" : "Individual cells in a genetically identical population, exposed to the same environment, can show great variation in their protein expression levels. This is due to noise, which is inherent in many biological processes, due in part to the low molecule numbers and probabilistic interactions which lead to stochasticity. Much of the work in the field of noise and its propagation in gene expression networks, whether it is experimental, modelling or theoretical, has been conducted on networks/systems that occur within a single cell. However, cells do not exist solely in isolation and understanding how cells are able to coordinate their behaviour despite this noise is an interesting area of expansion for the field. In this study, a synthetic intercellular communication system was designed that allows the investigation of how noise is propagated in intercellular communication. The communication system consists of separate sender and receiver cells incorporating components of the Lux quorum sensing system of Vibrio fischeri. The sender cell was designed so that the production of the signalling molecule, 3-oxohexanoyl homoserine lactone, is able to be controlled by addition of isopropyl-β-D-thio-galactoside (IPTG) and monitored via a reporter gene. The receiver cell was designed with a dual reporter system to enable the response of the cell to the signalling molecule to be monitored and the intrinsic and extrinsic noise contributions to the total noise to be calculated. Sender and the receiver cells were engineered in Escherichia coli. The functionality of the receiver cells was tested in the presence of known concentrations of the signalling molecule. The population response and the noise characteristics of the receiver cells in the homogeneous environment were determined from single cell measurements. The functionality of the sender cells was tested in the presence of a range of IPTG concentrations and the induction of expression from the LacI-repressible promoter was monitored. Mathematical models of the system were developed. Stochastic simulations of the models were used to investigate any unexplained behaviour seen in the characterisation of the cells. The full functionality of the intercellular communication system was then tested by growing the receiver in the collected media of the induced sender cells. The response of the receiver cells to the signalling molecule in the media was again characterised using single cell measurements of the reporter expression levels. The analysis of mixed populations of the sender and receiver cells was hampered by the technical limitations of the instruments used for the single cell measurements. Difficulties were encountered in simultaneous and specific measurement of the three reporter genes. Two methods for overcoming this issue were proposed using microscopy, and one of these methods was shown to have potential in overcoming the issue.",

  "description" : "Balhimycin, produced by the actinomycete Amycolatopsis balhimycina DSM5908, is a glycopeptide antibiotic highly similar to vancomycin, the antibiotic of 'last resort' used for the treatment of resistant Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria. Partial sequence of the balhimycin biosynthesis gene cluster was previously reported. In this work, cosmids which overlap the region of the characterized gene cluster were isolated and sequenced.

The G protein is remarkable in that it induces CD4+, but no CD8+ T cells in this mouse strain.

By contrast, vaccination with the fusion protein (F) induces both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, but not lung eosinophilia during RSV infection. These observations suggest that CD8+ T cells play a crucial role in preventing Th2-driven pathology. We therefore depleted mice with anti-CD8 antibodies in vivo. This treatment allowed lung eosinophilia to develop in F-primed mice. Depletion of interferon (IFN)-gamma had a similar effect, suggesting that secretion of this cytokine is the mechanism by which CD8+ T cells exert their effect. To test whether similar effects occurred in other strains of mice, RSV-infected C57BL/6 mice (which do not develop eosinophilia after sensitization to G) were treated with anti-IFN-gamma. Again, these mice developed eosinophilia. In this strain, genetic deletion of CD8-alpha, beta2-microglobulin or genes coding for the transporter associated with antigen presentation (which in each case eliminates CD8+ T cells) caused lung eosinophilia during RSV infection. These studies show the critical roles that CD8+ T cells and IFN-gamma production play in regulating Th2-driven eosinophilia and provide a unifying explanation for previous studies of lung eosinophilia.

  "description" : "In this paper a novel variable resolution method using particle splitting and coalescing for the SPH numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations is presented. The key idea of the scheme is to modify dynamically the particle sizes by means of splitting and coalescing (merging) individual particles to provide good resolution only where it is needed. The SPH scheme adopted is derived using the variational principle guaranteeing that both mass and momentum are conserved for particles with different smoothing lengths. A particle shifting procedure is used to prevent unacceptable anisotropic distributions of the particles and is further generalized for treating domains with variable mass particles. The algorithm has been tested against analytical solutions for Poiseuille and Taylor-Green flows showing that the shifting algorithm is effective in increasing the accuracy, and that error introduced by the splitting and coalescing is negligible. The capability of the numerical scheme for increasing efficiency is shown for more general problems: the simulations of a moving square in a box and flow past a cylinder have shown that the particle refinement procedure is able to increase the efficiency while maintaining the same level of accuracy as a uniform distribution with the most refined resolution.",

Nevertheless, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. A key point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers or volume of autophagic elements (e.g., autophagosomes or autolysosomes) at any stage of the autophagic process vs. those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway (i.e., the complete process); thus, a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagosome accumulation needs to be differentiated from stimuli that result in increased autophagic activity, defined as increased autophagy induction coupled with increased delivery to, and degradation within, lysosomes (in most higher eukaryotes and some protists such as Dictyostelium) or the vacuole (in plants and fungi). In other words, it is especially important that investigators new to the field understand that the appearance of more autophagosomes does not necessarily equate with more autophagy. In fact, in many cases, autophagosomes accumulate because of a block in trafficking to lysosomes without a concomitant change in autophagosome biogenesis, whereas an increase in autolysosomes may reflect a reduction in degradative activity. Here, we present a set of guidelines for the selection and interpretation of methods for use by investigators who aim to examine macroautophagy and related processes, as well as for reviewers who need to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of papers that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a formulaic set of rules, because the appropriate assays depend in part on the question being asked and the system being used. In addition, we emphasize that no individual assay is guaranteed to be the most appropriate one in every situation, and we strongly recommend the use of multiple assays to monitor autophagy.

  "description" : "Caveolin-1 (-/-) null stromal cells are a novel genetic model for cancer-associated fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Here, we used an unbiased informatics analysis of transcriptional gene profiling to show that Cav-1 (-/-) bone-marrow derived stromal cells bear a striking resemblance to the activated tumor stroma of human breast cancers. More specifically, the transcriptional profiles of Cav-1 (-/-) stromal cells were most closely related to the primary tumor stroma of breast cancer patients that had undergone lymph-node (LN) metastasis. This is consistent with previous morphological data demonstrating that a loss of stromal Cav-1 protein (by immuno-histochemical staining in the fibroblast compartment) is significantly associated with increased LN-metastasis. We also provide evidence that the tumor stroma of human breast cancers shows a transcriptional shift towards oxidative stress, DNA damage/repair, inflammation, hypoxia, and aerobic glycolysis, consistent with the \"Reverse Warburg Effect\". Finally, the tumor stroma of \"metastasis-prone\" breast cancer patients was most closely related to the transcriptional profiles derived from the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. This suggests that certain fundamental biological processes are common to both an activated tumor stroma and neuro-degenerative stress. These processes may include oxidative stress, NO over-production (peroxynitrite formation), inflammation, hypoxia, and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are thought to occur in Alzheimer?s disease pathology.

  "description" : "To exploit pluripotent cells for regenerative medicine applications it will be necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms that govern pluripotency and lineage commitment within these cells. The mechanism by which LIF sustains ‘naïve’ pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cell has recently been delineated; LIF signals to the core circuitry of pluripotency (Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog) via Jak/STAT3 and PI3K/Akt-mediated expression of Klf4 and Tbx3 respectively. E-cadherin has been shown to be required for LIF-dependent mES cell pluripotency since cell lines exhibiting low/no E-cadherin expression maintain pluripotency via Activin/Nodal. However, these cells maintain expression of the core circuitry of pluripotency, thus the role of E-cadherin in pluripotency remains elusive. To investigate this, we have characterised an E-cadherin negative proliferating stem (ENPS) cell line, generated by seeding wt mES cells at low density in the absence of LIF. These cells exhibit Activin/Nodal-dependent pluripotency marker expression but fail pluripotency tests such as EB differentiation and chimera generation and microarray analysis shows they lack naïve transcripts and express early lineage markers. We have also exploited two additional E-cadherin negative cell lines (Ecad-/- and EcadRNAi mES cells) to delineate the molecular mechanisms connecting E-cadherin to the core circuitry of pluripotency. These cells exhibit decreased expression of pluripotency markers Klf4 and Nanog, the latter a direct consequence of a lack of E-cadherin-mediated STAT3 activation. Interestingly, both ENPS and Ecad-/- mES cells can be ‘rescued’ to a naïve pluripotent state upon LIF stimulation. In ENPS cells, LIF supplementation induces restoration of E-cadherin expression, LIF-dependent pluripotency and EB and chimera generation abilities. In Ecad-/- mES cells, LIF supplemention restores LIF-dependent pluripotency via N-cadherin, thus demonstrating a novel role for N-cadherin in mES cell pluripotency. At high passage, ENPS cells (like some cancer cells) exhibit methylation of the E-cadherin promoter and PI3K-dependent increased survival compared to wt mES cells. Our findings provide a potential mechanism for the role of E-cadherin in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell generation, since STAT3 phosphorylation has recently been shown to be a limiting factor in this process. In addition, our data suggest E-cadherin can be manipulated to direct differentiation for regenerative medicine applications since ENPS cells exhibit a lineage bias towards neuroectoderm at the expense of endoderm specification.",

  "title" : "Simulations of the NK cell immune synapse reveal that activation thresholds can be established by inhibitory receptors acting locally.",
  "description" : "NK cell activation is regulated by a balance between activating and inhibitory signals. To address the question of how these signals are spatially integrated, we created a computer simulation of activating and inhibitory NK cell immunological synapse (NKIS) assembly, implementing either a \"quantity-based\" inhibition model or a \"distance-based\" inhibition model. The simulations mimicked the observed molecule distributions in inhibitory and activating NKIS and yielded several new insights. First, the total signal is highly influenced by activating complex dissociation rates but not by adhesion and inhibitory complex dissociation rates. Second, concerted motion of receptors in clusters significantly accelerates NKIS maturation. Third, when the potential of a cis interaction between Ly49 receptors and MHC class I on murine NK cells was added to the model, the integrated signal as a function of receptor and ligand numbers was only slightly increased, at least up to the level of 50% cis-bound Ly49 receptors reached in the model. Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, the integrated signal behavior obtained when using the distance-based inhibition signal model was closer to the experimentally observed behavior, with an inhibition radius of the order 3-10 molecules. Microscopy to visualize Vav activation in NK cells on micropatterned surfaces of activating and inhibitory strips revealed that Vav is only locally activated where activating receptors are ligated within a single NK cell contact. Taken together, these data are consistent with a model in which inhibitory receptors act locally; that is, that every bound inhibitory receptor acts on activating receptors within a certain radius around it.",
  "texts" : [ "Simulations of the NK cell immune synapse reveal that activation thresholds can be established by inhibitory receptors acting locally.", "NK cell activation is regulated by a balance between activating and inhibitory signals. To address the question of how these signals are spatially integrated, we created a computer simulation of activating and inhibitory NK cell immunological synapse (NKIS) assembly, implementing either a \"quantity-based\" inhibition model or a \"distance-based\" inhibition model. The simulations mimicked the observed molecule distributions in inhibitory and activating NKIS and yielded several new insights. First, the total signal is highly influenced by activating complex dissociation rates but not by adhesion and inhibitory complex dissociation rates. Second, concerted motion of receptors in clusters significantly accelerates NKIS maturation. Third, when the potential of a cis interaction between Ly49 receptors and MHC class I on murine NK cells was added to the model, the integrated signal as a function of receptor and ligand numbers was only slightly increased, at least up to the level of 50% cis-bound Ly49 receptors reached in the model. Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, the integrated signal behavior obtained when using the distance-based inhibition signal model was closer to the experimentally observed behavior, with an inhibition radius of the order 3-10 molecules. Microscopy to visualize Vav activation in NK cells on micropatterned surfaces of activating and inhibitory strips revealed that Vav is only locally activated where activating receptors are ligated within a single NK cell contact. Taken together, these data are consistent with a model in which inhibitory receptors act locally; that is, that every bound inhibitory receptor acts on activating receptors within a certain radius around it.", null ],

  "description" : "Recently, we reported that human breast cancer-associated fibroblasts show functional inactivation of the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor and down-regulation of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) protein expression. However, it remains unknown whether loss of Cav-1 is sufficient to confer functional RB inactivation in mammary fibroblasts. To establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship, mammary stromal fibroblasts (MSFs) were prepared from Cav-1(-/-) null mice and subjected to phenotypic analysis. Here, we provide evidence that Cav-1(-/-) MSFs share many characteristics with human cancer-associated fibroblasts. The Cav-1(-/-) MSF transcriptome significantly overlaps with human cancer-associated fibroblasts; both show a nearly identical profile of RB/E2F-regulated genes that are up-regulated, which is consistent with RB inactivation. This Cav-1(-/-) MSF gene signature is predictive of poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen. Consistent with these findings, Cav-1(-/-) MSFs show RB hyperphosphorylation and the up-regulation of estrogen receptor co-activator genes. We also evaluated the paracrine effects of \"conditioned media\" prepared from Cav-1(-/-) MSFs on wild-type mammary epithelia. Our results indicate that Cav-1(-/-) MSF \"conditioned media\" is sufficient to induce an epithelial-mesenchymal transition, indicative of an invasive phenotype. Proteomic analysis of this \"conditioned media\" reveals increased levels of proliferative/angiogenic growth factors. Consistent with these findings, Cav-1(-/-) MSFs are able to undergo endothelial-like transdifferentiation.

  "description" : "AbstractCell penetrating peptides (CPPs) have been used in many areas of drug delivery for mediating the delivery of peptides, protein, DNA, siRNA and liposomes. Additionally they have shown an ability to overcome drug resistance in cells enhancing chemotherapeutic activity. Our group has recently designed a promising multifunctional peptide, Tat-LK15, originating from the fusion of Tat peptide (49-57) with the synthetic amphipathic peptide, LK15. TAT-LK15 was found to be efficient at mediating DNA and siRNA delivery to cells especially contributing to the silencing of bcr-abl oncoprotein over a long period of time. To date, Tat-LK15 peptide’s cells uptake mechanism, which is expected to be influenced by the presence of the amphipathic sequence LK15, which is known to be lytic, has not been assessed. The aim of this project is to study the cellular uptake of the Tat-LK15 peptide and any influence it exerts on the uptake of p-glycoproteins substrates. Also we aimed to explore whether the peptide characteristics could be exploited to improve the delivery of the cytotoxic agent, doxorubicin.Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy experiments revealed that Tat-LK15 uptake was dependent on two mechanisms depending on the concentration of peptide used. At low concentrations (2.5µM and below) the uptake of TAMRA-Tat-LK15 peptide appeared to be temperature-dependent and was inhibited by sodium azide suggesting endocytosis as the main route of entry in the studied cell lines. At 5µM and above, the peptide’s uptake was less reliant on temperature and not be inhibited by sodium azide, but relied on membrane potential. Interestingly in K562 cells, the peptide accumulated on the cell membrane.The Tat-LK15 peptide membrane activity was also characterised: Tat-LK15 lytic activity was concentration-dependent. At 5µM the Tat-LK15 peptide led to approximately 60% LDH release in HT29 cells which is likely to be related to the amphipathic sequence, LK15 renowned for its membrane lytic activity. Further to this, the uptake of a membrane impermeant dye (SYTOX® blue) incubated with the peptide was followed as a function of time in K562 cells with a high content screening. The results appeared to substantiate the above findings that Tat-LK15 peptide has a concentration- and time-dependent membrane lytic activity. An MTT assay, after four hours of incubation, indicated very limited variation in cytotoxicity (EC50 ~ 5µM) over six different cell lines. More importantly, an Annexin V assay suggested a possible induction of apoptosis in the MCF-7 cell line, in contrast a Tat-LK15 concentration-dependent necrosis was observed in a K562 cell line. Finally attempts were made to exploit the properties of Tat-LK15 to overcome drug resistance of doxorubicin. Firstly Tat-LK15 peptide co-incubation with a model P-gp substrate (calcein AM) revealed a significant reduction of calcein fluorescence in K562 and HT29 cells and their doxorubicin resistant sublines (p<0.05). Attempts to conjugate doxorubicin to TAT-LK15 proved difficult. Consequently doxorubicin/Tat-LK15 admixtures were used to study whether the P-gp efflux of doxorubicin in doxorubicin resistance sublines could be circumvented. A significant increase of the toxicity relative to doxorubicin alone for long incubation times on several cell lines (p<0.05) indicated that using TAT-LK15 as an additive could potentially be considered as a drug delivery strategy. Thus the concept of conjugating a well known cell penetrating peptide to an amphipathic sequence is worthwhile however the findings in this study are not sufficient to highlight the full potential and major  improvements in efficacy needs to be achieved.",

In wild-type mice, apoptotic cells expressing CD200 that we believe contribute to the suppressed innate immune response to bacteria dominate during the resolution phase of influenza-induced inflammation.

  "description" : "The neuronal doctrine, developed a century ago regards neuronal networks as the sole substrate of higher brain function. Recent advances in glial physiology have promoted an alternative hypothesis, which places information processing in the brain into integrated neuronal-glial networks utilizing both binary (neuronal action potentials) and analogue (diffusional propagation of second messengers/metabolites through gap junctions or transmitters through the interstitial space) signal encoding. It has been proposed that the feed-forward and feed-back communication between these two types of neural cells, which underlies information transfer and processing, is accomplished by the release of neurotransmitters from neuronal terminals as well as from astroglial processes. Understanding of this subject, however, remains incomplete and important questions and controversies require resolution. Here we propose that the primary function of perisynaptic glial processes is to create an \"astroglial cradle\" that shields the synapse from a multitude of extrasynaptic signaling events and provides for multifaceted support and long-term plasticity of synaptic contacts through variety of mechanisms, which may not necessarily involve the release of \"glio\" transmitters.",

The function of caveolin-1 (Cav1), a multifunctional scaffold protein known to modulate several biologic processes in both normal tissue and cancer, has been recently investigated in melanoma cancer cells, but its role in the melanoma microenvironment remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that orthotopic implantation of B16F10 melanoma cells in the skin of Cav1KO mice increases tumor growth, and co-injection of Cav1-deficient dermal fibroblasts with melanoma cells is sufficient to recapitulate the tumor phenotype observed in Cav1KO mice. Using indirect coculture experiments with fibroblasts and melanoma cells combined with cytokine analysis, we found that Cav1-deficient fibroblasts promoted the growth of melanoma cells via enhanced paracrine cytokine signaling. Specifically, Cav1-deficient fibroblasts displayed increased ShhN expression, which heterotypically enhanced the Shh signaling pathway in melanoma cells. In contrast to primary tumor growth, the ability of B16F10 melanoma cells to form lung metastases was significantly reduced in Cav1KO mice. This phenotype was associated mechanistically with the inability of melanoma cells to adhere to and to transmigrate through a monolayer of endothelial cells lacking Cav1.

Recently, we proposed a new paradigm for understanding the role of the aging and the tumor microenvironment in cancer onset. In this model, cancer cells induce oxidative stress in adjacent stromal fibroblasts. This, in turn, causes several changes in the phenotype of the fibroblast including mitochondrial dysfunction, hydrogen peroxide production, and aerobic glycolysis, resulting in high levels of L-lactate production. L-lactate is then transferred from these glycolytic fibroblasts to adjacent epithelial cancer cells and used as \"fuel\" for oxidative mitochondrial metabolism.  Here, we created a new pre-clinical model system to directly test this hypothesis experimentally. To synthetically generate glycolytic fibroblasts, we genetically-induced mitochondrial dysfunction by knocking down TFAM using an sh-RNA approach.  TFAM is mitochondrial transcription factor A, which is important in functionally maintaining the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

Apex Peptide Elution Chain Selection {(APECS)} is a simple and powerful method for intensity-based peptide selection in a complex sample separated by {2D-LC}, using a {MALDI-TOF/TOF} instrument. It removes the peptide redundancy present in the adjacent first-dimension (typically strong cation exchange, {SCX)} fractions by constructing peptide elution profiles that link the precursor ions of the same peptide across {SCX} fractions. Subsequently, the precursor ion most likely to fragment successfully in a given profile is selected for fragmentation analysis, selecting on precursor intensity and absence of adjacent ions that may cofragment. To make the method independent of experiment-specific tolerance criteria, we introduce the concept of the branching factor, which measures the likelihood of false clustering of precursor ions based on past experiments. By validation with a complex proteome sample of Arabidopsis thaliana, {APECS} identified an equivalent number of peptides as a conventional data-dependent acquisition method but with a 35\\% smaller work load. Consequently, reduced sample depletion allowed further selection of lower signal-to-noise ratio precursor ions, leading to a larger number of identified unique peptides. ?? 2010 American Chemical Society.",

  "description" : "The correct outgrowth of axons is essential for the development and regeneration of nervous systems. Axon growth is primarily driven by microtubules. Key regulators of microtubules in this context are the spectraplakins, a family of evolutionarily conserved actin-microtubule linkers. Loss of function of the mouse spectraplakin ACF7 or of its close Drosophila homolog Short stop/Shot similarly cause severe axon shortening and microtubule disorganization. How spectraplakins perform these functions is not known. Here we show that axonal growth-promoting roles of Shot require interaction with EB1 (End binding protein) at polymerizing plus ends of microtubules. We show that binding of Shot to EB1 requires SxIP motifs in Shot's C-terminal tail (Ctail), mutations of these motifs abolish Shot functions in axonal growth, loss of EB1 function phenocopies Shot loss, and genetic interaction studies reveal strong functional links between Shot and EB1 in axonal growth and microtubule organization. In addition, we report that Shot localizes along microtubule shafts and stabilizes them against pharmacologically induced depolymerization. This function is EB1-independent but requires net positive charges within Ctail which essentially contribute to the microtubule shaft association of Shot. Therefore, spectraplakins are true members of two important classes of neuronal microtubule regulating proteins: +TIPs (tip interacting proteins; plus end regulators) and structural MAPs (microtubule-associated proteins). From our data we deduce a model that relates the different features of the spectraplakin C terminus to the two functions of Shot during axonal growth.",

There is evidence to suggest that selective binding of chemicals with proteins or peptides may impact on the quality of immune response that will develop.  In the investigations described here, we have taken a reductionist approach to protein reactivity and evaluated the binding characteristics of 20 of the most commonly reported chemical respiratory allergens towards defined peptides with a single reactive amino acid of interest.  The hypothesis is that it is possible to identify and characterize different forms of chemical allergens as a function of preferential peptide binding.Utilizing the standardized reaction conditions of a direct peptide reactivity assay (DPRA), the reactivity of respiratory allergens for cysteine and lysine peptides was evaluated.  Activity in the DPRA is reported as the percent depletion of peptide following 24 h incubation.  An important and intriguing observation was that, when compared with skin sensitizers, chemical respiratory allergens exhibited a preferential reactivity for lysine.  This preference was characterized quantitatively as a ratio of the mean depletion of lysine compared with cysteine (Lys:Cys ratio).  The Lys:Cys ratio was observed to be robust and reproducible over time.A limitation of many in chemico methods for hazard identification is the lack of a metabolic component that allows for the identification of pro-haptens.  In order to address this limitation, reported here is the use of the peroxidase peptide reactivity assay (PPRA), which utilizes a horseradish peroxidase/hydrogen peroxide (HRP/P) enzymatic system as a proxy for oxidative metabolism.  Additionally, reactivity in the PPRA is characterized after a 24 h reaction time utilizing a concentration-response model (thus, permitting consideration of dose-response relationships defined as an EC15 value).  Unexpectedly, the preferences for lysine observed with chemical respiratory allergens in the DPRA were lost or blunted in PPRA.  The EC15 values demonstrated that relative reactivity between chemical respiratory allergens varied by up to 4 orders of magnitude.  The identification of quantitative differences in reactivity could prove useful as a guide to evaluate potency in the future, should reliable metrics become available.To characterize the selectivity of binding by chemical respiratory allergens, the DPRA was modified to allow for the evaluation of reactivity to histidine, tyrosine and arginine.  Confirming our previous observations, each of the respiratory sensitizers was observed to react to both lysine and cysteine, with in most instances, a preference for the former.

  "title" : "Magnetic properties of graphene",
  "description" : "Graphene – a monolayer of carbon atoms densely packed in a honeycomb lattice – was isolated for the first time in 2004 and, since then, has established itself as one of the most remarkable materials available to condensed matter scientists today. Theory predicts a whole spectrum of magnetic phenomena in graphene, including several mechanisms for intrinsic ferromagnetism and spin-ordering effects that arise due to its low-dimensionality and highly unusual electronic properties (e.g. Dirac-like spectrum). In this experimental work, SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) magnetic measurements have been carried out in graphene laminates with masses up to ≈ mg obtained by ultrasonic exfoliation of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) in N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction experiments revealed that the laminates are made of decoupled graphene crystallites with typical flake size below 50 nm. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements carried out for graphene suspensions dispersed onto a SiO2 substrate allowed the recognition of thin crystallites associable to single and double-layer graphene. X-ray dispersive fluorescence (XRF) and electron dispersive diffraction (EDX) confirmed the laminates chemical purity with absence of metals and/or magnetic inclusions. Pristine laminates exhibit Curie paramagnetism noticeable below ≈ 50 K, which contributes to about one moment per crystallite at 2 K. The laminates are strongly diamagnetic, although a decrease of the diamagnetic susceptibility by about three times with respect to graphite was observed for fields applied perpendicularly to the ab plane. The same graphene laminates were employed as a reference system to study magnetism of point defects, such as fluorine adatoms and vacancies generated through ion irradiation. The unambiguous spin value J=1/2 found for both species of defects confirms theoretical expectations.

  "texts" : [ "Magnetic properties of graphene", "Graphene – a monolayer of carbon atoms densely packed in a honeycomb lattice – was isolated for the first time in 2004 and, since then, has established itself as one of the most remarkable materials available to condensed matter scientists today. Theory predicts a whole spectrum of magnetic phenomena in graphene, including several mechanisms for intrinsic ferromagnetism and spin-ordering effects that arise due to its low-dimensionality and highly unusual electronic properties (e.g. Dirac-like spectrum). In this experimental work, SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) magnetic measurements have been carried out in graphene laminates with masses up to ≈ mg obtained by ultrasonic exfoliation of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) in N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction experiments revealed that the laminates are made of decoupled graphene crystallites with typical flake size below 50 nm. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements carried out for graphene suspensions dispersed onto a SiO2 substrate allowed the recognition of thin crystallites associable to single and double-layer graphene. X-ray dispersive fluorescence (XRF) and electron dispersive diffraction (EDX) confirmed the laminates chemical purity with absence of metals and/or magnetic inclusions. Pristine laminates exhibit Curie paramagnetism noticeable below ≈ 50 K, which contributes to about one moment per crystallite at 2 K. The laminates are strongly diamagnetic, although a decrease of the diamagnetic susceptibility by about three times with respect to graphite was observed for fields applied perpendicularly to the ab plane. The same graphene laminates were employed as a reference system to study magnetism of point defects, such as fluorine adatoms and vacancies generated through ion irradiation. The unambiguous spin value J=1/2 found for both species of defects confirms theoretical expectations. In the case of fluorine atoms a magnetic moment of 1 µB  per ≈ 1000 adatoms was obtained, associated to the tendency of fluorine to cluster in graphene. Vacancies produced a value of the magnetic moment much closer to the expected 1 µB for point defects. No sign of defect related ferromagnetism was observed.

  "description" : "The Lhx2 transcription factor plays essential roles in morphogenesis and patterning of ectodermal derivatives as well as in controlling stem cell activity. Here, we show that during murine skin morphogenesis, Lhx2 is expressed in the hair follicle (HF) buds, whereas in postnatal telogen HFs Lhx2(+) cells reside in the stem cell-enriched epithelial compartments (bulge, secondary hair germ) and co-express selected stem cell markers (Sox9, Tcf4 and Lgr5). Remarkably, Lhx2(+) cells represent the vast majority of cells in the bulge and secondary hair germ that proliferate in response to skin injury. This is functionally important, as wound re-epithelization is significantly retarded in heterozygous Lhx2 knockout (+/-) mice, whereas anagen onset in the HFs located closely to the wound is accelerated compared with wild-type mice. Cell proliferation in the bulge and the number of Sox9(+) and Tcf4(+) cells in the HFs closely adjacent to the wound in Lhx2(+/-) mice are decreased in comparison with wild-type controls, whereas expression of Lgr5 and cell proliferation in the secondary hair germ are increased. Furthermore, acceleration of wound-induced anagen development in Lhx2(+/-) mice is inhibited by administration of Lgr5 siRNA. Finally, Chip-on-chip/ChIP-qPCR and reporter assay analyses identified Sox9, Tcf4 and Lgr5 as direct Lhx2 targets in keratinocytes. These data strongly suggest that Lhx2 positively regulates Sox9 and Tcf4 in the bulge cells, and promotes wound re-epithelization, whereas it simultaneously negatively regulates Lgr5 in the secondary hair germ and inhibits HF cycling. Thus, Lhx2 operates as an important regulator of epithelial stem cell activity in the skin response to injury.",

  "description" : "PURPOSE: Longitudinal scars on the radial quadrant of the distal forearm skin envelope are typically observed to be wider than those on the ulnar quadrant and have an increased incidence of hypertrophic change. Forearm rotation movements may produce differential skin tensions within the forearm skin envelope, and this may lead to differential scarring patterns. This study was designed to measure skin tension changes in the forearm as a result of rotational position to see if these would be consistent with the hypothesis that greater tension changes are observed on the radial aspect of the forearm. METHODS: The effect of forearm position on the magnitude and direction of skin tension was measured on human volunteers. Standardized circles were marked in circumferential fashion at specified intervals on forearm skin, and the angular and dimensional distortion of these circles that occurred with forearm rotation was measured with caliper and goniometer. Data were analyzed for statistical significance using paired t-test. RESULTS: Pronation and supination resulted in marked angular rotation of the lines of maximal skin tension at all sites on the forearm. Supination resulted in a greater angular deviation of the lines of maximal skin tension from the longitudinal line of usual surgical incision, particularly on the radial aspect of the forearm. In supination, the magnitude of ellipsoid deformation at the distal forearm was greater on the radial aspect compared with that of the ulnar. Similar significant changes were also demonstrated at the mid-forearm and proximal forearm levels. CONCLUSIONS: This study systematically maps the effects of pronation and supination on skin tension within the forearm skin envelope. The significant changes occurring in both the ellipsoid deformation and ellipsoid orientation support our hypothesis that the magnitude of skin tension changes significantly with forearm rotation. The radial aspect of the distal forearm experiences the greatest changes, particularly as the forearm supinates.",
