  "description" : "Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), the principal structural component of caveolae, participates in the pathogenesis of several fibrotic diseases, including systemic sclerosis (SSc). Interestingly, affected skin and lung samples from patients with SSc show reduced levels of Cav-1, as compared to normal skin. In addition, restoration of Cav-1 function in skin fibroblasts from SSc patients reversed their pro-fibrotic phenotype. Here, we further investigated whether Cav-1 mice are a useful pre-clinical model for studying the pathogenesis of SSc. For this purpose, we performed quantitative transmission electron microscopy, as well as biochemical and immuno-histochemical analysis, of the skin from Cav-1 (-/-) null mice. Using these complementary approaches, we now show that skin from Cav-1 null mice exhibits many of the same characteristics as SSc skin from patients, including a decrease in collagen fiber diameter, increased tensile strength, and stiffness, as well as mononuclear cell infiltration. Furthermore, an increase in autophagy/mitophagy was observed in the stromal cells of the dermis from Cav-1 (-/-) mice. These findings suggest that changes in cellular energy metabolism (e.g., a shift towards aerobic glycolysis) in these stromal cells may be a survival mechanism in this \"hostile\" or pro-inflammatory microenvironment. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Cav-1 (-/-) null mice are a valuable new pre-clinical model for studying scleroderma. Most importantly, our results suggest that inhibition of autophagy and/or aerobic glycolysis may represent a new promising therapeutic strategy for halting fibrosis in SSc patients. Finally, Cav-1 (-/-) null mice are also a pre-clinical model for a \"lethal\" tumor micro-environment, possibly explaining the link between fibrosis, tumor progression, and cancer metastasis.",

  "description" : "Pulmonary eosinophilia induced in C57BL/6 mice after Cryptococcus neoformans infection is driven by CD4(+) Th2 cells. The immunological mechanisms that protect against eosinophilia are not fully understood. Interaction of OX40 (CD134) and its ligand, OX40L, has been implicated in T cell activation and cell migration. Unlike CD28, OX40 is only expressed on T cells 1-2 days after Ag activation. Manipulation of this pathway would therefore target recently activated T cells, leaving the naive repertoire unaffected. In this study, we show that engagement of OX40 by an OX40L:Ig fusion protein drives IFN-gamma production by CD4(+) T cells and reduces eosinophilia and C. neoformans burden in the lung. Using gene-depleted mice, we show that reduction of eosinophilia and pathogen burden requires IL-12 and/or IFN-gamma. C. neoformans infection itself only partially induces OX40L expression by APCs.

  "description" : "Allergen-specific IgE production is the central event in the pathogenesis of atopic disorders and increases in specific IgE serum antibodies are an indicator of immediate hypersensitivity responses in humans and in animal models of allergy. Consequently, accurate and user-friendly methods are needed to measure serum levels of allergen-specific IgE. This review examines historical and recent developments in in vivo and in vitro methods for the detection of allergen-specific IgE in humans and in animal models. Routinely, in vitro methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays or radioallergosorbant tests and in vivo methods such as the skin prick test (SPT) for humans and the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis assay (PCA) used in animals are utilized to detect allergen-specific IgE. While in vivo assays are usually more accurate than in vitro assays since they provide a functional readout of IgE activity, they are relatively costly and require considerable expertise. On the other hand in vitro assays are limited by the fact that the amount of allergen-specific serum IgG exceeds IgE antibody by several orders of magnitude, resulting in competition for allergen binding. Consequently, methods that use allergen as a direct capture step are limited by the availability of free allergen binding sites for IgE. In order to circumvent this problem, in vitro methods usually require prior depletion of IgG or use high amounts of allergen in order to facilitate availability of free binding sites for IgE detection. Clearly, these approaches are limited for small sample volumes and allergens that are in short supply. New methods such as protein microarray could potentially overcome this problem by providing high allergen concentrations in a relatively small reaction volume. Currently, in vitro methods are rarely used in isolation for prognosis but are used primarily to complement the information obtained from in vivo assays.

  "description" : "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a frequent cause of severe lung disease in young children. Primed T cells are required for virus clearance, but are causally implicated in the enhanced pathology seen following RSV infection of some infants and experimental animals vaccinated against the virus. In BALB/c mice, vaccination with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the viral attachment protein (G) leads to pulmonary eosinophilia during subsequent infection, which indirect evidence suggests may be due to CD4+ Th2 cells. The production of IFN-gamma, IL-2, -4, -5 and -10 cytokine mRNA by RT-PCR and intracellular cytokines by flow cytometry following RSV challenge of vaccinated mice were therefore compared. Lung eosinophilia was associated with enhanced local recruitment of CD4+ cells in G sensitized mice, while CD8+ cells dominated in mice vaccinated with the viral fusion protein (F) or second matrix protein (M2). Lung eosinophilia was also associated with a localized reduction in IFN-gamma and increased IL-4 and IL-5 mRNA transcription as well as elevated RSV specific IgG1 antibody production. Th2 cytokine protein production by T cells showed no apparent change. Although IFN-gamma production diminished in eosinophilic mice, it remained the major cytokine found in lung T cells. It was concluded that lung eosinophilia can develop despite abundant IFN-gamma production by local T cells, but is associated with a shift in the balance between Th2 and Th1 cytokine production.",

  "description" : "Characterization of Chemical and Mechanical Properties of Polymer Based NanocompositesThe University of ManchesterTamer Wafy Doctor of Philosophy17 January, 2013One of the most significant issues in nanocomposite performance is improving the dispersion of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in thermosetting or thermoplastic polymers in order to gain good mechanical properties. Several studies have investigated the fabrication of nanocomposites based on carbon nanotubes and analysed properties, but there is still insufficient data on their structure-property relationships. This thesis has investigated the central importance of stress transfer Raman studies in epoxy composites reinforced with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) and multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to elucidate the reinforcing ability of the CNTs in an epoxy matrix. This project was undertaken to synthesise and characterize MWCNTs and determine the effect of different weight fractions of untreated MWCNTs on the stress transfer efficiency at the MWCNTS / epoxy interface and on the stiffness of the thermomechanical properties of the MWCNTS / epoxy composites. It was undertaken to assess the stress transfer efficiency at the CNT / epoxy interface and at the inter-walls of the CNTs with tensile deformation and with cyclic loading.Optimized conditions of the injection chemical vapour deposition method (CVD), such as long injection times were applied to produce MWCNTs with a high yield, high aspect ratio and well-defined G' Raman peak. The morphology and size of CNTs were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) while their thermal stability was examined by Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Both Raman spectroscopy and mechanical testing (static and dynamic) were utilized in this study. The Raman spectroscopy research consisted of following the G'-band frequency and linewidth as well as the intensity of radial breathing modes (RBMs) during tensile deformation. The stress-induced Raman shifts in the nanocomposites have been shown to be controlled by the number of carbon nanolayers. A theory has been developed to determine and simulate the stress transfer efficiency parameter, (k_i) for MWCNTs. Tensile tests and dynamic mechanical testing were used to assess the mechanical properties of the nanocomposites.The most obvious finding to be drawn from the present study is that the reinforcement of the epoxy resin with different loadings of MWCNTs is useful, but the best reinforcement was at low loadings of MWCNTs. One of the more significant findings to emerge from this study is that (k_i) between the inner walls of the DWCNTs and MWCNTs are quite similar (~0.7), which suggest that (k_i)  may be similar for all CVD MWCNTs and DWCNTs. The second major finding was that there were RBM intensity variations for the SWCNTs and DWCNTs in the hot-cured epoxy composites and that for the DWCNTs both the inner and outer nanotube walls are stressed during deformation",

  "description" : "The alphav integrin subunit is highly expressed in osteoclasts where it dimerizes with beta1 and beta3 subunits to form receptors for vitronectin and bone sialoproteins. Inhibition of osteoclast adhesion and function has previously been achieved by alphavbeta3 antibodies or Arg-Gly-Asp-containing peptides which have the disadvantages of blocking a single receptor type, or of being rather nonspecific, respectively. Here we show that alphav integrin expression in rabbit osteoclasts can be inhibited by partially phosphorothioated antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) spanning the adenine-uracil-guanine (AUG) translational start site of the human/rabbit alphav gene, a procedure which offers the advantage of affecting all the alphav receptors with high efficiency. The alphav antisense ODN caused a dose-dependent, substrate-specific reduction of osteoclast adhesion and bone resorption. Control ODNs, such as sense, inverted, and mismatch, were without effect, providing evidence of specificity of the antisense reagent. It is likely as a consequence of loss of substrate interaction, the antisense ODN induced osteoclast retraction and apoptosis, increase of the cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complex inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1, and inhibition of the cell survival gene, bcl-2. Although the expression of the cell death-promoting gene, bax, remained unchanged, a reduction of the bcl-2/bax ratio, known to underlie the intracellular signal to apoptosis, was observed. This finding led us to hypothesize that these changes could provide a link between reduction of alphav synthesis and osteoclast programmed death. In conclusion, this study provides novel insights into the use of alphav antisense ODN as an efficacious mechanism for blocking osteoclast function and underscores for the first time the involvement of integrins in bone cell apoptosis.

  "description" : "The contrast agent gadofosveset, which binds reversibly to serum albumin, has a high longitudinal relaxivity at lower magnetic fields (≤3.0 T) but a much lower relaxivity at high fields. Spin locking is sensitive to macromolecular content; it is hypothesized that combining this technique with the albumin-binding properties of gadofosveset may enable increased relaxivity at high fields. In vitro measurements at 4.7 T found significantly higher spin-lock relaxation rates, R(1ρ) (1/T(1ρ) ), when gadofosveset was serum albumin-bound than when unbound. R(1ρ) values for a nonbinding contrast agent (gadopentetate dimeglumine) in serum albumin were similar to those for unbound gadofosveset. R(2) (1/T(2) ) values were also significantly higher at 4.7 T for serum albumin-bound gadofosveset than for unbound.

  "texts" : [ "Overcoming the low relaxivity of gadofosveset at high field with spin locking.", "The contrast agent gadofosveset, which binds reversibly to serum albumin, has a high longitudinal relaxivity at lower magnetic fields (≤3.0 T) but a much lower relaxivity at high fields. Spin locking is sensitive to macromolecular content; it is hypothesized that combining this technique with the albumin-binding properties of gadofosveset may enable increased relaxivity at high fields. In vitro measurements at 4.7 T found significantly higher spin-lock relaxation rates, R(1ρ) (1/T(1ρ) ), when gadofosveset was serum albumin-bound than when unbound. R(1ρ) values for a nonbinding contrast agent (gadopentetate dimeglumine) in serum albumin were similar to those for unbound gadofosveset. R(2) (1/T(2) ) values were also significantly higher at 4.7 T for serum albumin-bound gadofosveset than for unbound. Spin locking at high field generates significantly higher relaxation rates for gadofosveset than conventional contrast agents and may provide a method for differentiating free and bound molecules at these field strengths.

  "title" : "Characterising the Innate and Adaptive Immune Response to Intestinal Helminth infection",
  "description" : "Abstract Gastrointestinal parasites are one of the most prevalent infections known to infect mammals, estimated to affect over one billion people globally. It is well established that the generation of a type two response, characterised by CD4+ T cell secretion of interleukin (IL)-13, IL-4 and IL-9 will expel most gastrointestinal helminths. Expulsion is mediated by a variety of effector mechanisms including altered mucin production, intestinal mast cell activation, increased epithelial cell turnover and increased muscle contraction. Protective immunity can be generated over time; however, infections can persist to chronicity following the modulation of a protective type two response, such as the generation of a type one response. This response, characterised by IFN-γ and IL 12 secretion, can lead to long lived infections, placing huge morbidity upon infected individuals. The mechanisms leading to the generation of a type one or type two response are not fully understood and are of paramount importance if a vaccine to helminth parasites is to be developed. In addition, the dysregulation of these responses is thought to be the cause of allergy and autoimmunity and understanding the regulation of type two responses will also add to our understanding of these diseases.Numerous labs have recently reported roles for new innate cells, such as nuocytes, as sources of IL 13, a cytokine critical to worm expulsion.  In addition, data from this lab has demonstrated that NK cell derived IL-13 is the cause of pathology during infection with Trichinella spiralis. It has also been shown that NK cells provide a supplementary source of IL-13 in Trichuris muris infected IL-4-/- mice. This thesis has used 2 strains of mice; the E4bp4-/- mouse and the Il13eGFP reporter mouse, in order to dissect the role of innate cells in the immune response to the related helminth parasites T. muris and T. spiralis. The transcription factor E4BP4 has been shown to control CD4+ T cell IL-5 and 13 secretion and the development of NK cells. Data presented in this thesis shows that following a low dose infection, which usually persists to chronicity in WT mice, E4bp4-/- mice were able to expel the parasite following the generation of an elevated type two response. This effect was abrogated following CD4+ T cell depletion, indicative of an essential role for these cells in this response. It was also shown that E4BP4 ablation was sufficient to delay expulsion of a high dose of T. muris, indicative of a key role for E4BP4 in regulating type two responses to T. muris. Contrary to the hypothesis, it was demonstrated that NK cells did not play a major role in protective immunity to T. muris.In addition, the data presented here shows, for the first time, the induction of nuocytes in the MLN following both T. muris and T. spiralis infection. Nuocytes made an early contribution to IL-13 secretion following T. spiralis infection; whereas low levels of Il13eGFP+ cells were observed only at day 18-21 post T. muris infection, with nuocytes making a less significant contribution to IL-13 levels. The levels of different cell lineages in the MLN post infection and their contribution to IL-13 expression was also mapped in detail.Finally, an analysis of the haematopoietic response in the bone marrow following T. muris infection was undertaken. The percentage and number of early progenitor Lineage-Sca-1+c-kit+ (LSK) cells in the bone marrow increased at day 21 post T. muris infection. LSK levels returned to normal after this time, indicative of an inflammation dependent response. Interestingly, E4bp4 ablation abrogated this effect, in line with the hypothesised role of IFN-γ in this expansion. Taken together, this data has added to our knowledge of the orchestration of immune responses to two intestinal helminth parasites; T. muris and T. spiralis.",

Importantly, PAI-1/2(+) fibroblasts promote the growth of MDA-MB-231 tumors (a human breast cancer cell line) in a murine xenograft model, without any increases in angiogenesis. Similarly, PAI-1/2(+) fibroblasts stimulate experimental metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells using an in vivo lung colonization assay. Further mechanistic studies revealed that fibroblasts overexpressing PAI-1 or PAI-2 display increased autophagy (\"self-eating\") and are sufficient to induce mitochondrial biogenesis/activity in adjacent cancer cells, in co-culture experiments. In xenografts, PAI-1/2(+) fibroblasts significantly reduce the apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 tumor cells. The current study provides further support for the \"Autophagic Tumor Stroma Model of Cancer\" and identifies a novel \"extracellular matrix\"-based signaling mechanism, by which a loss of stromal Cav-1 generates a metastatic phenotype.

  "description" : "This is a thesis submitted by Patrick Horgan on 31/03/2010 for the degree ofMaster of Philosophy in The University of Manchester for the study “Use ofmethamphetamine phMRI in humans to investigate the role of dopamine inreward and other functions related to mental illness”.IntroductionDopamine is a neurochemical that has an important role in brain processessuch as memory, learning and movement. In this study, manipulation ofdopamine receptors by methamphetamine and amisulpride was completed inhealthy volunteers undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).Amisulpride is a selective dopamine receptor antagonist whereasmethamphetamine increases neuronal dopamine release.

Assays of resting cells were used to determine the effect of cell concentration and depth of shade of the dyeing on the color removal process. Further resting cell assays were carried out to ascertain if an electron donor was required for the color removal process, and suggested that the cotton substrate could supply some reducing power to the biocatalyst, although dye reduction rates were maximal with added electron donor (formate). The Shewanella cells were also able to remove the color from dyed cotton fabric that was isolated inside a dialysis membrane to prevent contact with the cells.

  "description" : "Endotoxins a component of the outer membrane of the cell wall of gram negative bacteria, stimulate the innate immune system to elicit an inflammatory response in mammals. Deletion of base excision repair (BER) genes has been reported to decrease the immune response to endotoxin in mouse models. It is currently unknown whether this role is limited to a few select proteins or a result of the general function of the BER pathway. The aim of this study was to identify if the loss of other BER proteins would trigger a similar response by measuring the levels of inflammatory cytokines produced and certain biomarkers of oxidative stress. To facilitate this, a new strain of NEIL1-/- mice was successfully created as well as a putative NEIL2-/- strain. A previous strain of NEIL1-/- mice displayed a sporadic obese phenotype, our NEIL1-/- mice showed no significant increase in bodyweight when compared to WT mice. Whilst there were significant differences in the serum content of cytokines IL-6, IL-12, IL-10 and IL-4 between wildtype, NEIL1-/- and OGG1-/- mice challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, the active component of endotoxin). When compared to wildtype animals both NEIL1-/- and OGG1-/- mice produced lower levels of the Th1 cytokine IL-6 (♂ 1 h; p<0.05 and ♀ 24 h; p<0.01), and the Th2 IL-10 cytokine (♀ 6 and 24 h; p<0.01) along with other sex and genotype specific differences. When comparing LPS induced organ damage in NEIL1-/- and wildtype mice there were no significant differences in myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity or malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration due to genotype. However, there were significant differences observed in glutathione (GSH) levels in the heart (p=0.01), lung (p=0.05), liver (p=0.05) and ileum (p=0.05) that when considered alongside a significant increase in the weights of adrenal glands in NEIL1-/- knockout (♂ p=0.05, ♀ p=0.03) mice were suggestive of a raised level of adrenaline. The OGG1-/- mice displayed no significant genotype x treatment interaction in MPO activity, MDA levels or GSH levels. However, genotype x sex interactions were observed in the liver and lung tissues of OGG1-/- for MPO (lung p<0.01, liver p=0.02), MDA (lung p<0.01) and GSH (lung p=0.05, liver p=0.04) indicating that female OGG1-/- mice had greater protection from the oxidative effects of LPS induced inflammation. In conclusion whilst the knockout of OGG1 and NEIL1 genes had an effect on the inflammatory signalling response, this effect was not great enough to impact upon oxidative stress markers of inflammation within the tissues sampled. The mechanism of how this is accomplished is at present unclear and worthy of further study.",

  "description" : "BACKGROUND: With increasing age the immune system shows functional decline. In the skin this is associated with an increased incidence of epidermal malignancies and infections. Epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) act as sentinels of the immune system, recognizing, processing and presenting antigen and inducing T-cell responses. Previous investigations have demonstrated a reduction in the number of epidermal LCs in elderly subjects. Moreover, the ability of LCs to migrate in response to tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, but not interleukin (IL)-1β, is significantly impaired in the elderly. OBJECTIVES: To characterize further the changes in LC function that are associated with increasing chronological age, we have evaluated age-related changes in the response of monocyte-derived LCs (mLCs) to IL-1β and TNF-α. METHODS: The phenotype and function of mLCs were compared in six young (≤ 30 years) and six aged (≥ 70 years) healthy individuals using a combination of flow cytometry, cytokine and chemokine array, and a Transwell migration assay. RESULTS: Monocytes from aged individuals were able to differentiate into LCs. There were no significant differences in expression of activation markers, or in baseline or inducible cytokine secretion, by mLCs derived from aged or young subjects. Furthermore, migration in response to a chemokine ligand, CCL19, was equivalent in both age groups. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that changes in LC function in the elderly are not associated with changes in systemic dendritic cell phenotype and function. Conditioning of LCs in situ by the epidermal microenvironment is likely to be more important.",

  "description" : "Previous studies have shown that tumour cells from low-grade B-cell gastric lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type proliferate in vitro in response to heat-killed whole cell preparations of Helicobacter pylori, but only in the presence of tumour-infiltrating T cells.

These results suggest that B-cell proliferation in cases of low-grade gastric lymphoma of MALT type in vitro in response to H. pylori is due to recognition of H. pylori by tumour-infiltrating T cells, which in turn provide help for tumour cell proliferation.

  "description" : "OBJECTIVES: Atelectasis presents a challenging, often progressive, problem in children. Because of the lack of a clinically practical classification, we introduce a new classification, which in our opinion is more useful in the pediatric age group. This alternative classification enables a more clinically relevant correlation between stage of disease and clinical sequelae and technical difficulty at surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Observational study of patients seen and operated at the Sophia Children's Hospital in Rotterdam, The Netherlands between 1989 and 2005. METHODS: Based on clinical appearance, each ear was placed into one of the five groups of the proposed classification and into one of the four stages of Sadé's classification. Preoperative air and bone conduction thresholds and air-bone gaps (ABG) were calculated using the four-tone pure-tone (500, 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 Hz) averages for bone and air conduction. RESULTS: : Of the 248 ears in the study group, 72 were in stage I, with an ABG of 18.2 +/- 12.3 dB. Twenty-two were in stage II, with an ABG of 12.9 +/- 9.5 dB. In stage III, there were 32 ears, with an ABG of 11.6 +/- 10.0 dB. Thirty-one ears were in stage IV, with an ABG of 16.1 +/- 11.5 dB. Eighty-five ears were in stage V, with an ABG of 26.1 +/- 13.3 dB. When grouped according to Sadé's classification, 92 ears could not be classified.

  "description" : "This thesis presents an investigation of pH-responsive, redox-sensitive poly(MMA-co- MAA) and poly(EA-co-MAA) hollow particles for the repair of load-bearing soft tissues, such as articular cartilage and the intervertebral disc.\tHollow particles continue to attract major interest due to their numerous potential applications. The new method for hollow particle preparation presented in this thesis does not require the use of a colloidal template and is well suited for scaling up. Hollow particles were formed using linear poly(MMA-co-MAA) and poly(EA-co-MAA) aliphatic copolymers synthesised using free-radical chain copolymerisation performed in solution. These copolymers were dissolved in dichloromethane using methanol as a cosolvent and emulsified in water. Diffusion of the methanol into the aqueous phase prompts precipitation of the copolymer at the droplet/water interface. The more hydrophobic copolymers containing less MAA showed improved morphology compared to copolymers containing more MAA. Also, poly(EA-co-MAA) hollow particles had a more spherical morphology than poly(MMA-co-MAA) hollow particles with equivalent MAA contents. This was attributed to the lower Tg of the EA structural monomer, which resulted in more flexible particle shells.\tUnusually, during potentiometric titration of uncrosslinked hollow particles, the pH of the system decreased with increasing neutralisation. This behaviour is thought to be due to the unfolding of copolymer chains, exposing shielded carboxyl groups. The random structure of the copolymers is believed to be necessary for this behaviour. Crosslinked particles became swollen when the pH was increased using buffers. Concentrated dispersions formed self supporting gels, due to steric confinement, at 5 wt.%. The crosslinking process was performed by functionalising with cystamine using carbodiimide chemistry. This introduced disulphide crosslinks; which could be cleaved under reducing conditions at high pH, dissolving the gels. This ability to reduce the hollow particle shells to their constituent linear copolymer chains gives potential for natural removal from the body via extraction by the renal system. pH-triggered loading and release of a hydrophilic dye using crosslinked hollow particles was demonstrated. The similarity of the particle formation process to traditional solvent evaporation also allowed the loading of a hydrophobic dye. However, these particles were not crosslinked so release following swelling could not be investigated.\tCystamine-crosslinked systems suffered from degradation due to thiol-disulphide exchange at high pH (~ pH 8). Crosslinking of one system was performed using 2-amino ethyl methacrylate (AEM). This introduced covalent, vinyl intra-shell crosslinking; which did not break down at high pH. Additional AEM was also used to allow inter-particle UVcrosslinking to form doubly crosslinked (DX) hollow-particle hydrogels. These gels did not re-disperse in buffer. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a covalent hydrogel formed from pH-responsive hollow particles. The DX gels offer improved mechanical properties compared to the singly crosslinked, physical gels.\tFreeze-dried samples of all of the gels produced during this study showed highly porous structures when observed using SEM. The rapid diffusion of FITC-dextran through a sample of DX gel indicates that these pores were interconnected.

  "description" : "With increasing age, dynamic tissues such as lungs, blood vessels and skin lose their ability to both deform and recoil, culminating in tissue stiffening. This loss of tissue elasticity, which profoundly impacts tissue function and thus morbidity, may be due not only to changes in the relative abundance of key extracellular matrix proteins within tissues but also to their accumulation of post-translational modifications. Whilst to date attention has focussed primarily on the age-related non-enzymatic formation of advanced glycation end products, the accumulation of pathological enzyme-mediated cross-links may also lead to age-related tissue stiffening. The lysyl oxidase (LOX) family of enzymes are constitutively expressed in adult tissues and are known to drive the catalysis of cross-links in both fibrillar collagens and elastin. Although immunochemical approaches are commonly used to localise the inactive pro-enzyme of LOX, and biochemical methods are employed to quantify activity in homogenised tissue, they do not allow for the in situ localisation of the enzyme. Thus, we have developed a novel assay to both detect and localise LOX enzyme activity in situ. LOX family members are amine oxidases and this assay uses the principle that an amine substrate in the presence of this class of enzyme will be oxidised to an aldehyde and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). In turn, H(2)O(2), when combined with luminol and horseradish peroxidase, will produce a light-emitting reaction that can be detected by film autoradiography.

  "description" : "Here we used the Met-1 cell line in an orthotopic transplantation model in FVB/N mice to dissect the role of the Cav-1(P132L) mutation in human breast cancer. Identical experiments were performed in parallel with wild-type Cav-1. Cav-1(P132L) up-regulated the expression of estrogen receptor-alpha as predicted, because only estrogen receptor-alpha-positive patients have been shown to harbor Cav-1(P132L) mutations. In the context of primary tumor formation, Cav-1(P132L) behaved as a loss-of-function mutation, lacking any tumor suppressor activity. In contrast, Cav-1(P132L) caused significant increases in cell migration, invasion, and experimental metastasis, consistent with a gain-of-function mutation. To identify possible molecular mechanism(s) underlying this invasive gain-of-function activity, we performed unbiased gene expression profiling. From this analysis, we show that the Cav-1(P132L) expression signature contains numerous genes that have been previously associated with cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. These include i) secreted growth factors and extracellular matrix proteins (Cyr61, Plf, Pthlh, Serpinb5, Tnc, and Wnt10a), ii) proteases that generate EGF and HGF (Adamts1 and St14), and iii) tyrosine kinase substrates and integrin signaling/adapter proteins (Akap13, Cdcp1, Ddef1, Eps15, Foxf1a, Gab2, Hs2st1, and Itgb4). Several of the P132L-specific genes are also highly expressed in stem/progenitor cells or are associated with myoepithelial cells, suggestive of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These results directly support clinical data showing that patients harboring Cav-1 mutations are more likely to undergo recurrence and metastasis.",

  "description" : "Synopsis Cutaneous ageing is the result of two distinct, biological processes which may occur concurrently: (i) the passage of time, termed intrinsic ageing and (ii) environmental influences, termed extrinsic ageing. Intrinsic ageing of the skin is a slow process which causes changes in tissue structure and impairs function in the absence of additional biological, chemical and physical factors. The clinical features of intrinsically aged skin are not usually evident until old age when, although smooth and unblemished, the skin surface appears pale and is characterized by fine wrinkles with occasional exaggerated expression lines. Functionally, intrinsically aged skin is dry and less elastic than more youthful skin. In contrast, extrinsically aged skin is exemplified by deep, coarse wrinkles, mottled hyperpigmentation and a marked loss of elasticity and recoil. The two major environmental influences which induce extrinsic ageing are: (i) chronic exposure to solar ultraviolet (UV) irradiation (termed photoageing) and (ii) smoking.

To identify proteins that catalyze solute transport across the vacuolar membrane, the membrane proteome of purified Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuoles was analyzed. Subtractive proteomics was used to distinguish contaminants from true vacuolar proteins by comparing the relative abundances of proteins in pure and crude preparations. A robust statistical analysis combining enrichment ranking with the double boundary iterative group analysis revealed that 148 proteins were significantly enriched in the pure vacuolar preparations. Among these proteins were well characterized vacuolar proteins, such as the subunits of the vacuolar H+-ATPase, but also proteins that had not previously been assigned to a cellular location, many of which are likely novel vacuolar membrane transporters, e.g. for nucleosides and oligopeptides. Although the majority of contaminating proteins from other organelles were depleted from the pure vacuolar membranes, some proteins annotated to reside in other cellular locations were enriched along with the vacuolar proteins.

  "description" : "The light-driven enzyme protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR) catalyzes the reduction of protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) to chlorophyllide (Chlide). This reaction is a key step in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll. Ultrafast photochemical processes within the Pchlide molecule are required for catalysis and previous studies have suggested that a short-lived excited-state species, known as I675*, is the first catalytic intermediate in the reaction and is essential for capturing excitation energy to drive subsequent hydride and proton transfers. The chemical nature of the I675* excited state species and its role in catalysis are not known. Here, we report time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy measurements to study the involvement of the I675* intermediate in POR photochemistry. We show that I675* is not unique to the POR-catalyzed photoreduction of Pchlide as it is also formed in the absence of the POR enzyme. The I675* species is only produced in samples that contain both Pchlide substrate and Chlide product and its formation is dependent on the pump excitation wavelength. The rate of formation and the quantum yield is maximized in 50∶50 mixtures of the two pigments (Pchlide and Chlide) and is caused by direct energy transfer between Pchlide and neighboring Chlide molecules, which is inhibited in the polar solvent methanol. Consequently, we have re-evaluated the mechanism for early stage photochemistry in the light-driven reduction of Pchlide and propose that I675* represents an excited state species formed in Pchlide-Chlide dimers, possibly an excimer. Contrary to previous reports, we conclude that this excited state species has no direct mechanistic relevance to the POR-catalyzed reduction of Pchlide.",

  "title" : "Transforming growth factor-beta1 stimulation enhances Dupuytren's fibroblast contraction in response to uniaxial mechanical load within a 3-dimensional collagen gel.",
  "description" : "PURPOSE: A function of fibroblasts is the generation of cytomechanical force within their surrounding extracellular matrix. Abnormalities in force generation may be the cause of many pathologic conditions including scarring, and some fibroproliferative disorders such as Dupuytren's disease, which is the focus of this report. METHODS: This work investigated the cytomechanical responses of Dupuytren's-derived fibroblasts to externally applied mechanical force using a culture force monitor model, with and without stimulation with the fibrosis-linked cytokine, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). We compared these responses with cytomechanical responses of fibroblasts derived from the transverse carpal ligament. RESULTS: Dupuytren's fibroblasts display a significantly greater ability to contract a collagen matrix compared with control fibroblasts, with a maximum generated force of 131 dynes (p < .001). These cells did not exhibit a characteristic plateau phase in the contraction, which indicates a delay in achieving tensional homeostasis from Dupuytren's-derived cells. After being subjected to uniaxial overload and underload, Dupuytren's fibroblasts responded by increased force generation, whereas control fibroblasts responded by a reduction in force in response to an overload, and contraction in response to an underload. These changes were exacerbated by the addition of the profibrotic factor TGF-beta1, with a significant increase in generated force for all cell types, in particular during the early phase of fibroblast attachment and contraction, and a positive contraction gradient in response to overloading forces. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that cells derived from this fibrotic disease display characteristic abnormalities in force generation profiles. Their default response to loading or underloading is contraction, or increased force generation. This work highlights the role of TGF-beta1 as a mechano-transduction cytokine, which has an influence on the early phase cell of force generation, as well as a role in mechanical responses of cells to external mechanical stimuli. This, in turn, may influence the progression of Dupuytren's disease and the high rates of recurrence seen postoperatively.",

  "description" : "OBJECTIVE: In order to increase sensitivity to detect longitudinal change, recording of within-grade changes was introduced for cartilage morphology and bone marrow lesion (BML) assessment in semiquantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scoring of knee osteoarthritis (OA). The aim of this study was to examine the validity provided by within-grade scoring. DESIGN: The Multicenter Osteoarthritis (MOST) study is a longitudinal study of subjects with or at risk of knee OA. Baseline and 30 months MRIs were read according to the modified Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score (WORMS) system including within-grade changes for cartilage and BMLs. We tested the validity of within-grade changes by whether the 30-month changes in cartilage and BML assessment were predicted by baseline ipsi-compartmental meniscal damage and malalignment, factors known to affect cartilage loss and BMLs, using ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: 1867 Knees (from 1411 participants) were included. Severe medial meniscal damage predicted partial grade (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 4.4, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 2.2, 8.7) but not ≥full grade (aOR 1.3, 95% CI 0.8, 2.2) worsening of cartilage loss and predicted both, partial grade (aOR 9.6, 95% CI 3.6, 25.1) and ≥full grade (aOR 5.1, 95% CI 3.2, 8.2) worsening of BMLs.

  "description" : "The LSPE is a balloon-borne mission aimed at measuring the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) at large angular scales, and in particular to constrain the curl component of CMB polarization (B-modes) produced by tensor perturbations generated during cosmic inflation, in the very early universe. Its primary target is to improve the limit on the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations amplitudes down to r = 0.03, at 99.7% confidence. A second target is to produce wide maps of foreground polarization generated in our Galaxy by synchrotron emission and interstellar dust emission. These will be important to map Galactic magnetic fields and to study the properties of ionized gas and of diffuse interstellar dust in our Galaxy. The mission is optimized for large angular scales, with coarse angular resolution (around 1.5 degrees FWHM), and wide sky coverage (25% of the sky). The payload will fly in a circumpolar long duration balloon mission during the polar night. Using the Earth as a giant solar shield, the instrument will spin in azimuth, observing a large fraction of the northern sky. The payload will host two instruments. An array of coherent polarimeters using cryogenic HEMT amplifiers will survey the sky at 43 and 90 GHz. An array of bolometric polarimeters, using large throughput multi-mode bolometers and rotating Half Wave Plates (HWP), will survey the same sky region in three bands at 95, 145 and 245 GHz. The wide frequency coverage will allow optimal control of the polarized foregrounds, with comparable angular resolution at all frequencies.",

  "description" : "Cancer cells show a broad spectrum of bioenergetic states, with some cells using aerobic glycolysis while others rely on oxidative phosphorylation as their main source of energy. In addition, there is mounting evidence that metabolic coupling occurs in aggressive tumors, between epithelial cancer cells and the stromal compartment, and between well-oxygenated and hypoxic compartments. We recently showed that oxidative stress in the tumor stroma, due to aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction, is important for cancer cell mutagenesis and tumor progression. More specifically , increased autophagy/mitophagy in the tumor stroma drives a form of parasitic epithelial-stromal metabolic coupling. These findings explain why it is effective to treat tumors with either inducers or inhibitors of autophagy, as both would disrupt this energetic coupling. We also discuss evidence that glutamine addiction in cancer cells produces ammonia via oxidative mitochondrial metabolism. Ammonia production in cancer cells, in turn, could then help maintain autophagy in the tumor stromal compartment. In this vicious cycle, the initial glutamine provided to cancer cells would be produced by autophagy in the tumor stroma. Thus, we believe that parasitic epithelial-stromal metabolic coupling has important implications for cancer diagnosis and therapy, for example, in designing novel metabolic imaging techniques and establishing new targeted therapies. In direct support of this notion, we identified a loss of stromal caveolin-1 as a marker of oxidative stress, hypoxia, and autophagy in the tumor microenvironment, explaining its powerful predictive value.

To realise this target for nonlinear systems, this thesis brings in an assumption about the existence of a controlled invariant mani- fold and a Desired Feedforward Control (DFC) which is contained in the input to compensate the influence of disturbances. According to the approximation property of Neural Networks (NN) that any periodic signals defined in a compact set can be approximated by NN, the NN-based disturbance approximator is applied to approximate the DFC.

These forms are the output feedback form, the extended output feedback form, the decentralised output feedback form and the partial state feedback form. For these systems, four types of uncertainties are mainly considered. The first one is the disturbance that can be eliminated by the DFC. Secondly, the parameter uncertainty is taken into account. To get rid of this uncertainty, the adaptive control technique is employed for the estimation of unknown parameters, e.g. the NN gain matrix. The third one is the nonlinear uncertainty. For the case that nonlinear uncertainties are polynomials, it has a bound consisting of an unknown constant and a function of the regulated error such that this uncertainty can be also treated as the parameter uncertainty.

  "description" : "Friction joining techniques, such as Friction Stir Spot Welding (FSSW) and high power Ultrasonic Welding (USW), could offer a solution for joining dissimilar materials combinations, such as aluminium (Al) to magnesium (Mg), where high intermetallic reaction rates make the use of conventional joining techniques problematic. Ultrasonic welds have been produced between 1 mm gauge Al 6111-T4 and Mg AZ31-H24 sheets, and the interfacial reaction has been studied as a function of welding time. For this welding system, the mechanical properties of the joints were optimised when a double reed welding system was employed to join materials that had been prepared using 800 grit SiC paper under a clamping force of 1.9 kN, and when the materials were oriented with the rolling direction parallel to the vibration direction. Welds produced between Al and Mg achieved similar peak lap shear strengths to those produced between Mg and Mg at welding times of 0.4 s, but the failure energy of the Al-Mg welds was less than half that of the parent material. In addition, the Al-Mg welds always failed at the interface between the sheets, rather than the desirable, and more energy intensive, pullout mechanism. The inferior mechanical properties were attributed to the rapid formation of a brittle intermetallic layer that initially formed as islands of the γ-Al12Mg17 phase. These islands rapidly spread and became continuous within 0.3 s of welding time, at which point a second sublayer of the β-Al3Mg2 phase began to form on the Al side of the intermetallic reaction layer. The combined layers reached a total thickness of 20 µm within 0.9 s of welding time, with the β-Al3Mg2 sublayer becoming the thicker of the two by this point. At longer welding times, interface liquation was observed at temperatures below the recognised lowest temperature eutectic reaction in the Al-Mg binary phase diagram. This was the result of the alloying elements present in the system and there was no depression in the melting point as a result of the high strain rate associated with this process, as has been proposed elsewhere. The rate of growth of the intermetallic layer during welding was higher than in static heat treatments, which was most likely due to the deformation causing microcracking in the brittle intermetallic layer, allowing short circuit diffusion to occur, and enhancing the growth rate by a factor of approximately 2. Finally, attempts were made to limit the rate of intermetallic compound (IMC) formation by applying coatings to the Mg sheet. The effect of the coatings was to reduce the overall IMC layer thickness by 50 %.",

  "description" : "The effect of the chemoattractants, interleukin-8 (IL-8) and N-formylmethionyl-leucylphenylalanine (fmlp) on neutrophil phagocytosis of serum-opsonised Aspergillus fumigatus conidia were studied. Pre-exposure of neutrophil monolayers to IL-8 (10-100 ng ml-1) or fmlp (10(-6)M) for 20 min increased phagocytosis from 15% to 35%. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in the numbers of conidia ingested by active neutrophils. The chemoattractants did not enhance phagocytosis of conidia when added contemporaneously to neutrophil monolayers.

  "description" : "Understanding how cell cycle is regulated in normal mammary epithelia is essential for deciphering defects of breast cancer and therefore for developing new therapies. Signals provided by both the extracellular matrix and growth factors are essential for epithelial cell proliferation. However, the mechanisms by which adhesion controls cell cycle in normal epithelia are poorly established. In this study, we describe the consequences of removing the β1-integrin gene from primary cultures of mammary epithelial cells in situ, using CreER. Upon β1-integrin gene deletion, the cells were unable to progress efficiently through S-phase, but were still able to undergo collective two-dimensional migration. These responses are explained by the presence of β3-integrin in β1-integrin-null cells, indicating that integrins containing different β-subunits exert differential control on mammary epithelial proliferation and migration. β1-Integrin deletion did not inhibit growth factor signaling to Erk or prevent the recruitment of core adhesome components to focal adhesions. Instead the S-phase arrest resulted from defective Rac activation and Erk translocation to the nucleus. Rac inhibition prevented Erk translocation and blocked proliferation. Activated Rac1 rescued the proliferation defect in β1-integrin-depleted cells, indicating that this GTPase is essential in propagating proliferative β1-integrin signals. These results show that β1-integrins promote cell cycle in mammary epithelial cells, whereas β3-integrins are involved in migration.",

  "title" : "Rheological Properties of Fibrin Clots",
  "description" : "A study of the rheological properties of fibrin, an important coagulant in human haemostasis, is presented in this MPhil thesis. Fibrin monomers are activated at the site of an injury to a blood vessel through the thrombin-induced cleavage of fibrinogen, a protein which circulates in the blood. These monomers self-assemble into networks by branching out and connecting with each other. This is the process which gives rise to a blood clot. There are a variety of factors which have an influence on the structure of the fibrin network, which in turn have an influence on the physical properties of the clot. The influence of two of these factors, fibrinogen concentration and thrombin concentration, is investigated in this paper. The motivation for this work is the need to determine what makes a perfect blood clot, and to find out if increasing the concentration of fibrinogen or thrombin increases the long-term stability of clots. Previous research has highlighted some of the remarkable rheological properties of this material, namely by frequency-dependent experiments. In this work frequency-independent measurements of the time evolution of fibrin clot rigidity, and how this is related to the concentration of thrombin and fibrinogen, are presented. Measurements were taken using a Bohlin Gemini HR Nano Rheometer over a period of 16 hours. Samples were prepared with Tris-EDTA buffer, both with the addition of salt and without, either with a fixed concentration of thrombin and varying fibrinogen, or with a fixed concentration of fibrinogen and varying thrombin. It was found that the time evolution of the rigidity exhibited three separate phases, characterised by a steady increase in rigidity, followed by a sharp increase, and ending with a plateau, during which rigidity ceased to increase. Samples prepared with a higher concentration of thrombin or fibrinogen exhibited an increase in rigidity in the first phase, but this behaviour is not observed after the first phase. Consistent with previous research, it was determined that the clotting time of fibrin decreases with increasing concentration of thrombin or fibrinogen. This effect is also observed when salt is added to the Tris-EDTA buffer. The addition of salt was also found to have an effect on the long-term stability of clots, as the rigidity of samples prepared with salt experienced a sharp decline in the third phase. This can be related to the structure of fibrin, and the findings in this work can be used to help increase our understanding of how to make a perfect clot.",

  "title" : "Influence of protein expression system on elicitation of IgE antibody responses: experience with lactoferrin.",
  "description" : "With increased interest in genetically modified (GM) crop plants there is an important need to understand the properties that contribute to the ability of such novel proteins to provoke immune and/or allergic responses. One characteristic that may be relevant is glycosylation, particularly as novel expression systems (e.g. bacterial to plant) will impact on the protein glycoprofile. The allergenicity (IgE inducing) and immunogenicity (IgG inducing) properties of wild type native human lactoferrin (NLF) from human milk (hm) and neutrophil granules (n) and a recombinant molecule produced in rice (RLF) have been assessed. These forms of lactoferrin have identical amino acid sequences, but different glycosylation patterns: hmNLF and nNLF have complex glycoprofiles including Lewis (Le)(x) structures, with particularly high levels of Le(x) expressed by nNLF, whereas RLF is simpler and rich in mannose residues. Antibody responses induced in BALB/c strain mice by intraperitoneal exposure to the different forms of lactoferrin were characterised.

  "texts" : [ "Influence of protein expression system on elicitation of IgE antibody responses: experience with lactoferrin.", "With increased interest in genetically modified (GM) crop plants there is an important need to understand the properties that contribute to the ability of such novel proteins to provoke immune and/or allergic responses. One characteristic that may be relevant is glycosylation, particularly as novel expression systems (e.g. bacterial to plant) will impact on the protein glycoprofile. The allergenicity (IgE inducing) and immunogenicity (IgG inducing) properties of wild type native human lactoferrin (NLF) from human milk (hm) and neutrophil granules (n) and a recombinant molecule produced in rice (RLF) have been assessed. These forms of lactoferrin have identical amino acid sequences, but different glycosylation patterns: hmNLF and nNLF have complex glycoprofiles including Lewis (Le)(x) structures, with particularly high levels of Le(x) expressed by nNLF, whereas RLF is simpler and rich in mannose residues. Antibody responses induced in BALB/c strain mice by intraperitoneal exposure to the different forms of lactoferrin were characterised. Immunisation with both forms of NLF stimulated substantial IgG and IgE antibody responses. In contrast, the recombinant molecule was considerably less immunogenic and failed to stimulate detectable IgE, irrespective of endotoxin and iron content.

  "description" : "The bialaphos resistance gene, bar, was used as a selectable marker to isolate the bialaphos production genes (bap) from the Streptomyces viridochromogenes genome. The S. viridochromogenes bar gene was cloned on overlapping restriction fragments using pIJ680 and pIJ702 in the bialaphos-sensitive host, S. lividans. Although the restriction endonuclease cleavage map of these fragments was not similar to the bap cluster of S. hygroscopicus, the presence and location of bar and four other bap genes as well as a gene required for the transcriptional activation of the cluster (brpA) was demonstrated by heterologous cloning experiments using a series of previously characterized bialaphos-nonproducing S. hygroscopicus mutants. Since recombination-deficient mutants of streptomycetes have not been isolated, restored function provided by cloned homologous DNA results from both recombination (marker rescue) and complementation in trans. In contrast to our previously reported homologous cloning experiments where we were able to define the position of mutant alleles by recombination, in these heterologous cloning experiments we observed little if any recombination between plasmid-cloned genes and the chromosome. As a result, this approach allowed us to define the location and orientation of functional genes using a genetic complementation test. The organization of the clustered S. viridochromogenes bap genes was indistinguishable from the corresponding S. hygroscopicus mutant alleles. The fact that the S. viridochromogenes transcriptional regulatory gene, brpA, functioned in S. hygroscopicus implied that some transcriptional regulatory signals may also be interchangeable. In these two Streptomyces species, which have considerable nucleotide sequence divergence, the complex biochemical and genetic organization of the bialaphos biosynthetic pathway is conserved.",

Although the restriction endonuclease cleavage map of these fragments was not similar to the bap cluster of S. hygroscopicus, the presence and location of bar and four other bap genes as well as a gene required for the transcriptional activation of the cluster (brpA) was demonstrated by heterologous cloning experiments using a series of previously characterized bialaphos-nonproducing S. hygroscopicus mutants. Since recombination-deficient mutants of streptomycetes have not been isolated, restored function provided by cloned homologous DNA results from both recombination (marker rescue) and complementation in trans. In contrast to our previously reported homologous cloning experiments where we were able to define the position of mutant alleles by recombination, in these heterologous cloning experiments we observed little if any recombination between plasmid-cloned genes and the chromosome. As a result, this approach allowed us to define the location and orientation of functional genes using a genetic complementation test. The organization of the clustered S. viridochromogenes bap genes was indistinguishable from the corresponding S. hygroscopicus mutant alleles. The fact that the S. viridochromogenes transcriptional regulatory gene, brpA, functioned in S. hygroscopicus implied that some transcriptional regulatory signals may also be interchangeable. In these two Streptomyces species, which have considerable nucleotide sequence divergence, the complex biochemical and genetic organization of the bialaphos biosynthetic pathway is conserved.", null ],

  "title" : "Rapid reagentless quantification of alginate biosynthesis in Pseudomonas fluorescens bacteria mutants using FT-IR spectroscopy coupled to multivariate partial least squares regression.",
  "description" : "Alginate is an important medical and commercial product and currently is isolated from seaweeds. Certain microorganisms also produce alginate and these polymers have the potential to replace seaweed alginates in some applications, mainly because such production will allow much better and more reproducible control of critical qualitative polymer properties. The research conducted here presents the development of a new approach to this problem by analysing a transposon insertion mutant library constructed in an alginate-producing derivative of the Pseudomonas fluorescens strain SBW25. The procedure is based on the non-destructive and reagent-free method of Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy which is used to generate a complex biochemical infrared fingerprint of the medium after bacterial growth. First, we investigate the potential differences caused by the growth media fructose and glycerol on the bacterial phenotype and alginate synthesis in 193 selected P. fluorescens mutants and show that clear phenotypic differences are observed in the infrared fingerprints. In order to quantify the level of the alginate we also report the construction and interpretation of multivariate partial least squares regression models which were able to quantify alginate levels successfully with typical normalized root-mean-square error in predictions of only approximately 14%. We have demonstrated that this high-throughput approach can be implemented in alginate screens and we believe that this FT-IR spectroscopic methodology, when combined with the most appropriate chemometrics, could easily be modified for the quantification of other valuable microbial products and play a valuable screening role for synthetic biology.",

  "title" : "A Study of Beam Position Diagnostics with Beam-excited Dipole Higher Order Modes using a Downconverter Test Electronics in Third Harmonic 3.9 GHz Superconducting Accelerating Cavities at FLASH",
  "description" : "Beam-excited higher order modes (HOM) in accelerating cavities contain transverse beam position information. Previous studies have narrowed down three modal options for beam position diagnostics in the third harmonic 3.9 GHz cavities at FLASH. Localized modes in the beam pipes at approximately 4.1 GHz and in the fifth cavity dipole band at approximately 9 GHz were found, that can provide a local measurement of the beam position. In contrast, propagating modes in the first and second dipole bands between 4.2 and 5.5 GHz can reach a better resolution. All the options were assessed with a specially designed test electronics built by Fermilab. The aim is to define a mode or spectral region suitable for the HOM electronics. Two data analysis techniques are used and compared in extracting beam position information from the dipole HOMs: direct linear regression and singular value decomposition. Current experiments suggest a resolution of 50 micron accuracy in predicting local beam position using modes in the fifth dipole band, and a global resolution of 20 micron over the complete module. Based on these results we decided to build a HOM electronics for the second dipole band and the fifth dipole band, so that we will have both high resolution measurements for the whole module, and localized measurements for individual cavity. The prototype electronics is being built by Fermilab and planned to be tested in FLASH by the end of 2012.",
