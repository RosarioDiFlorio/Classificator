  "description" : "Aspergillus niger is a common clinical isolate. Multiple species comprise the Aspergillus section Nigri and are separable using sequence data. The antifungal susceptibility of these cryptic species is not known. We determined the azole MICs of 50 black aspergilli, 45 from clinical specimens, using modified EUCAST (mEUCAST) and Etest methods. Phylogenetic trees were prepared using the internal transcribed spacer, beta-tubulin, and calmodulin sequences to identify strains to species level and the results were compared with those obtained with cyp51A sequences. We attempted to correlate cyp51A mutations with azole resistance. Etest MICs were significantly different from mEUCAST MICs (P < 0.001), with geometric means of 0.77 and 2.79 mg/liter, respectively. Twenty-six of 50 (52%) isolates were itraconazole resistant by mEUCAST (MICs > 8 mg/liter), with limited cross-resistance to other azoles. Using combined beta-tubulin/calmodulin sequences, the 45 clinical isolates grouped into 5 clades, A. awamori (55.6%), A. tubingensis (17.8%), A. niger (13.3%), A. acidus (6.7%), and an unknown group (6.7%), none of which were morphologically distinguishable. Itraconazole resistance was found in 36% of the isolates in the A. awamori group, 90% of the A. tubingensis group, 33% of the A. niger group, 100% of the A. acidus group, and 67% of the unknown group. These data suggest that cyp51A mutations in section Nigri may not play as important a role in azole resistance as in A. fumigatus, although some mutations (G427S, K97T) warrant further study. Numerous cryptic species are found in clinical isolates of the Aspergillus section Nigri and are best reported as \"A. niger complex\" by clinical laboratories. Itraconazole resistance was common in this data set, but azole cross-resistance was unusual. The mechanism of resistance remains obscure.",

  "description" : "The University of ManchesterFaculty of Engineering and Physical SciencesABSTRACT OF THESIS submitted by Bryan ReesFor the degree of Doctor of Philosophyand entitled \"A study of planetary nebulae in and towards the Galactic Bulge\"Date of submission  30/06/2011A planetary nebula (PN) consists of material, mainly gas, that has been ejected from a star on the asymptotic giant branch of its life cycle. This material emits electromagnetic radiation due to photoionization and recombination, collisional and radiative excitation or free-free radiation. The envelope of material moves outwards from the central star and may take one of a variety of shapes. These shapes are believed to be sculpted by the stellar wind, magnetic fields and interactions with a binary companion. However, within a time scale of as little as 10 000 years the nebula fades from view and merges with the interstellar medium.Similar variations in the shape of planetary nebulae (PNe) can be seen in both the Galactic Bulge and Disc and in the Magellanic Clouds. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the shaping process is universal.  By classifying PNe by morphology and relating those shapes to other nebular properties we have attempted to derive information about that shaping process.We have used photometric narrowband observations of a sample of PNe listed in the Strasbourg-ESO Catalogue of Galactic Planetary Nebulae  to investigate the relationship between PN morphology and the other PN characteristics. The high resolution images were made using ESO's New Technology Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope. The information we could obtain directly from the observations was augmented by information in the literature in order to address that question. The observations were used to classify the morphologies of 154 PNe, to estimate the sizes of 138 of those nebulae that we considered to lie within the Galactic Bulge, to determine the orientations of 130 of those Bulge nebulae and to derive photometric fluxes for the 69 PNe which had observations of standard stars made during the same night. Information on central star binarity, nebular abundances and radial and expansion velocity was obtained from the literature.Our photometrically derived PNe line fluxes were used to verify 59 H-beta and 69 [OIII] catalogued values (which were  obtained using spectroscopy). We found sufficient discrepancy between the values for 9 PNe to merit a further check taking place.We found no distinguishing relationship between PN morphology and any of PN size, radial velocity, or angular location within the Bulge. The abundances of He and O, and the N/O ratio, are generally lower in bipolar nebulae than in those nebulae with no apparent internal structure. We are unable to come to any conclusion as to a relationship between PN morphology and stellar metallicity.Given the short lifespan of PNe and the age of the Bulge it appears that almost all PNe in the Bulge must be associated with low mass stars. The high ratio of bipolar PNe we found in our Bulge sample suggests that, at least within the Bulge, bipolar nebulae are not necessarily associated with high mass stars. Our results show that unlike the orientations of other types of PNe the orientations of the bipolar nebulae in the Bulge are not randomly distributed. Measured to a line tip to tip along the lobes they peak and have their mean approximately along the Galactic Plane. This suggests that the bipolar PNe originate in a different environment from other morphological types, perhaps related to binary separation. However, we find that bipolarity does not imply common-envelope evolution. If the hypothesis that bipolar nebulae are formed in binary star systems is correct, binary systems in the Galactic Bulge have angular momentum vectors that are preferentially aligned along the Galactic Plane. As the orientation appears to be unrelated to lobe size and hence nebular age, the alignment implies that the non-random nature of the angular momentum vectors originated at the time the Bulge stellar population formed. We suggest that it is due to the direction and strength of the ambient magnetic fields.",

  "title" : "Cataclastic fault rocks in underground excavations: a geological characterisation",
  "description" : "The present study makes part of a research project on the geological and geomechanical characterisation of weak cataclastic fault rocks encountered in underground excavation sites in the Alps. The project is composed of a geological and a geomechanical part, split up in two PhD theses and realised in parallel at the Laboratory of Geology (GEOLEP) and the Laboratory of Rock Mechanics (LMR) at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne. By their very contrasting and unfavourable mechanical behaviour in underground excavations, weak cataclastic fault zones influence directly the excavation method, the safety of the working site, the choice of tunnel support, the long-term behaviour and the costs of the infrastructure. The construction of galleries across cataclastic fault zones bears furthermore the potential risk to modify the local and regional hydrogeological regime. Weak cataclastic fault rocks show a large scatter of geological and geomechanical properties. Due to their low cohesion, they alter rapidly when exposed to weathering. They can hence be studied and sampled in natural outcrops and exploratory boreholes only with great difficulty. Analyses and laboratory tests are laborious and require special sample preparation techniques and equipments. For these reasons still little is known about their geological, hydrogeological and geomechanical behaviour. The purpose of this study is to develop a detailed and objective differentiation and characterisation method for weak cataclastic fault rocks. Classifications and terminologies of (weak) cataclastic fault rocks are in fact still controversial. After a review of fault rock definitions and rock deformation mechanisms, the term kakirite has been retained in agreement with Heitzmann (1985) and Wyder (1997) as a general designation for weak, cohesionless cataclastic fault rocks. This term has been approved recently by the Swiss Society of Engineers and Architects (SIA) to designate fault zones made up of \"loose, structureless material\" (SIA Norm 199, 1998). Cataclastic fault zones have been studied and sampled in galleries currently under construction in different geological and tectonic contexts in the Alps. Research has been concentrated mainly on fault zones occurring in quartzo-phyllitic host rocks. For comparison, fault rocks from greenstones and serpentinite have been analysed too. To improve the understanding of the geomechanical and hydrogeological behaviour of weak cataclastic fault rocks, a new quantitative characterisation method has been developed. In a simplified approach, the geomechanical behaviour of (fault) rocks is considered to be controlled by two factors, namely the:  mineralogical composition (mwVh), and rock fabric (TC, MC)  The proposed mineralogical and structural characterisation of cataclastic fault rocks is referring to the meso- to microscopic scale, respectively to a scale comparable with common geomechanical laboratory tests. Mineralogy is expressed quantitatively by means of the mean weighted Vickers hardness, mwVh (Calembert et al., 1980a). The relative proportions of the principal rock forming minerals have been determined by semi-quantitative XRD-analyses. The mineralogical composition of kakirites, adjacent host rock samples and sieved kakirite grainsize fractions has been determined. Comparing the composition of the different grainsize fractions a clear dependency of grainsize on mineralogical composition has been found in kakirites. Quartz content is in general considerably higher in the clast than in the matrix fraction. The later is in fact composed mainly of phyllosilicates. This mineralogical grainsize fractionation is interpreted to be controlled by the original host rock fabric, the strength contrast between the involved mineral phases and alteration processes. Except kaolinite (Varzo), no other alteration mineral phases have been identified. The presence of (swelling) clay-minerals in very low proportions which cannot be detected by the performed whole rock XRD-analyses cannot be excluded however. Kakirite samples sieved for XRD-analyses show an extended grainsize distributions with in general high proportions of silt/clay grainsize fraction (mean 45%). This may explain the often observed very low permeability of kakirite zones. Their hydrogeological role is illustrated in the last part of this work by the means of a case history of a fault zone crossed by the gallery of Cleuson-Dixence. It demonstrates the often observed groundwater flow barrier-effect of cataclastic fault zones and its impact on the excavation work and the local hydrogeological regime. Rock fabric of kakirites has been characterised by thin section analyses with subsequent semiautomatic image analysis. It is based on a two-phase \"clast-matrix\" model, considering kakirites to be composed of varying proportions of \"hard\" clasts and \"weak\", fine-grained matrix. Clast properties (density, shape and relative orientation) are quantified by the texture coefficient (TC) of Howarth & Rowlands (1987). Pre-existing discontinuities in the matrix are characterised by a newly developed matrix coefficient (MC), involving the discontinuity density, roughness, mean length and relative orientation. The combined structural approach involving the MC and TC has shown to be appropriate to characterise and differentiate a wide range of weak cataclastic fault rocks by their microscopic rock fabric. Two opposite kakirite fabric types can be distinguished: first, a granular fabric, characterised by clasts taken in a fine-grained, isotropic matrix. Second, a discontinuity dominant, often schistose fabric wherein no clasts can be identified. A gradual transition is observed in-between these two end-member types. In order to assess the validity of the developed characterisation method, a first attempt of correlation has been made between the mineralogical-structural parameters and corresponding rock strength of kakirites tested by Habimana (1999). The found correlation is a strong motivation to continue the started research on cataclastic fault rocks with the presented mineralogical and structural approach.",

  "description" : "The physically reasonable assumption that the seed bodies which initiated the accretion of the individual asteroids, planets, and comets (subsequently these objects are collectively called planetoids) formed by stochastic processes requires a radius distribution function which is unique except for two scaling parameters: the total number of planetoids and their most probable radius. The former depends on the ease of formation of the seed bodies while the second is uniquely determined by the average pre-encounter velocity, V, of the accretable material relative to an individual planetoid. This theoretical radius function can be fit to the initial asteroid radius distribution which [Anders, 1965] derived from the present-day distribution by allowing for fragmentation collisions among the asteroids since their formation. Normalizing the theoretical function to this empirical distribution reveals that there were about 102 precollision asteroids and that V = (2-4)  x  10-2 km/sec which was presumably the turbulent velocity in the Solar Nebula. Knowing V we can determine the scale height of the dust in the Solar Nebula and consequently its space density. The density of accretable material determines the rate of accretion of the planetoids. From this we find, for example, that the Earth formed in about 8  x  106 yr and it attained a maximum temperature through accretion of about 3  x  103[deg]K. From the total mass of the terrestrial planets and the theoretical radius function we find that about 2  x  103 planetoids formed in the vicinity of the terrestrial planets. Except for the asteroids the smaller planetoids have since been accreted by the terrestrial planets. About 15% of the present mass of the terrestrial planets was accumulated by the secondary accretion of these smaller primary planetoids. There are far fewer primary planetoids than craters on the Moon or Mars. The craters were likely produced by the collisional breakup of a few primary planetoids with masses between one-tenth and one lunar mass. This deduction comes from comparing the collision cross sections of the planetoids in this mass range to that of the terrestrial planets. This comparison shows that two to three collisions leading to the breakup of four to six objects likely occurred among these objects before their accretion by the terrestrial planets. The number of these fragments is quite adequate to explain the lunar and Martin craters. Furthermore the mass spectrum of such fragments is a power-law distribution which results in a power-law distribution of crater radii of just the type observed on the Moon and Mars. Applying the same analysis to the planetoids which formed in the vicinity of the giant planets reveals that it is unlikely that any fragmentation collisions took place among them before they were accreted by these planets due to the integrated collision cross section of the giant planets being about three orders of magnitude greater than that of the terrestrial planets. We can thus anticipate a marked scarcity of impact craters on the satellites of these outer planets. This prediction can be tested by future space probes. Our knowledge of the radius function of the comets is consistent with their being primary planetoids. The primary difference between the radius function of the planetoids which formed in the inner part of the solar system and that of the comets results from the fact that the seed bodies which grew into the comets formed far more easily than those which grew into the asteroids and the terrestrial planets. Thus in the outer part of the Solar Nebula the principal solid material (water and ammonia snow) accreted into a huge (~1012+) number of relatively small objects (comets) while in the inner part of the nebula the solid material (hard-to-stick refractory substances) accumulated into only a few (~103) large objects (asteroids and terrestrial planets).

  "title" : "Heights and multiplicative relations on algebraic varieties",
  "description" : "Points on a subvariety X of a semi-abelian variety A that are contained in a subgroup,\r\nlet the subgroup be of finite rank or algebraic, are subject to severe restrictions\r\narithmetical nature.\r\nFiniteness results for intersections of X with subgroups of finite rank have been studied\r\nby Faltings, Hindry, Laurent, McQuillan, Raynaud, Vojta and others. More recently\r\nseveral authors ([CZ00], [BMZ99], [BMZ03], [BMZ06a], [BMZ06b], [BMZ04],\r\n[Via03], [RV03], [R´em05b], [R´em07], [Pin05b], [Zan00], [Zil02], [Mau06]) have\r\nconsidered the intersection of X with A[r], the set of complex points in A contained in\r\nan algebraic subgroup of codimension greater or equal to r. If H is a fixed algebraic\r\nsubgroup of A with codimension strictly less than dimX, then a dimension counting\r\nargument shows that X\\H is either empty or contains a curve. As we are allowing H to\r\nvary with fixed codimension, the intersection X \\ A[r] may be quite large if r < dimX.\r\nIn this thesis we are only interested in the case r   dimX.\r\nIf not stated otherwise we will also assume throughout the introduction that all\r\nvarieties are defined over Q, the field of algebraic numbers. One can define a height\r\nfunction on the set of algebraic points of A. Throughout this thesis we work only in\r\nthe algebraic torus Gn\r\nm or an abelian variety. So we can take the Weil height or the\r\nN´eron-Tate height associated to an ample line bundle.\r\nWe will pursue two types of questions. First, for which r does the set X0(Q) \\ A[r]\r\nhave bounded height and how do these bounds depend on X? Second, for which r is the\r\nset X00(Q) \\ A[r] finite? Here X0 and X00 are obtained from removing from X certain\r\nsubvarieties in order to to eliminate trivial counterexamples. For example if X is a\r\nproper algebraic subgroup of Gn\r\nm with positive dimension, then there is no hope for a\r\nboundedness of height or finiteness result for U(Q) \\ (Gn\r\nm)[r] if r   dimX and if U is\r\nZariski open and dense in X. In this case X0 and X00 are both empty.\r\nThe simplest non-trivial example seems to be the curve defined by x + y = 1 in\r\nG2\r\nm. Here we can take X0 and X00 to equal our curve. Algebraic subgroups of G2\r\nm\r\ncan be described by at most two monomial relations x y  = 1 with integer exponents\r\n  and  . For subgroups of dimension 1, one non-trivial relation suffices. If (x, y) is\r\ncontained in such a subgroup then x and y are called multiplicatively dependent. Hence\r\nthe intersection of our curve with the union of all proper algebraic subgroups of G2\r\nm can\r\nbe described by the solutions of\r\n(0.0.1) x (1 − x)  = 1.\r\n\r\nThis is an equation in three unknowns x,  , and  , so one should not expect finitely\r\nmany solutions. Indeed, taking x 6= 1 a root of unity gives infinitely many solutions.\r\nIn [CZ00] Cohen and Zannier showed that if H denotes the absolute non-logarithmic\r\nWeil height then (0.0.1) implies the sharp inequality max{H(x),H(1−x)}   2. In chapter\r\n2 we start off by giving an alternative proof of Cohen and Zannier’s Theorem. We\r\neven show that the possibly larger height H(x, 1−x) is at most 2. In their paper, Cohen\r\nand Zannier also proved that 2 is an isolated point in the range of max{H(x),H(1−x)}.\r\nWe make this result explicit in Theorem 2.2, working instead with H(x, 1 − x). The\r\nproof applies Smyth’s Theorem on lower bounds for heights of non-reciprocal algebraic\r\nnumbers and a Theorem of Mignotte.\r\nAs was already noticed in [CZ00], solutions of (0.0.1) are closely linked to roots of\r\ncertain trinomials whose coefficients are roots of unity. In chapter 3 Theorem 3.2 we\r\nfollow this avenue by factoring such trinomials over cyclotomic fields. Having essentially\r\na minimal polynomial in our hands, we obtain a new proof for the boundedness of\r\nH(x, 1 − x) with x as in (0.0.1). More importantly, in Theorem 3.1 we show that not\r\nonly is 2 isolated in the range of the height function, but also that H(x, 1−x) converges\r\nto an absolute constant if [Q(x) : Q] goes to infinity. The proof determines the value\r\nof this limit: it is the Mahler measure of the two-variable polynomial X + Y − 1. In a\r\ncertain sense this Mahler measure is the height of the curve in our problem.\r\nIn Theorem 3.3 we prove a conjecture of Masser stated in [Mas07]: the number\r\nof solutions of (0.0.1) with [Q(x) : Q]   D is asymptotically equal to c0D3 with c0 =\r\n2.06126 . . . as D ! 1. The constant c0 is defined properly in chapter 3 as a converging\r\nseries. This counting result is a further application of Theorem 3.2.\r\nIn chapter 4 we generalize the method from chapter 2 to bound the height of multiplicatively\r\ndependent solutions of\r\n(0.0.2) x + y =  .\r\nHere   is now any non-zero algebraic number. In [BMZ99] Bombieri, Masser, and\r\nZannier prove a more general result which also implies boundedness of height in this\r\ncase. Their Proposition A leads to an explicit upper bound for the height; the bound\r\nis polynomial in H( ). We are mainly interested in upper bounds for H(x, y) which\r\nhave good dependency in H( ). The value H( ) can be regarded as the height of\r\nthe defining equation (0.0.2). In Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 we get the bound H(x, y)   2H( ) min{H( ), 7 log(3H( ))}. By Theorem 4.3 the exponent of the logarithm cannot\r\nbe less than 1. But in some special cases, e.g. if   is a rational integer, we improve the\r\nupper bound to 2H( ), see Theorem 4.4. In this theorem we also show that if   is a\r\nrational integer then 2H( ) is attained as a height if and only if   is a power of two.\r\nThus if   is a power of two, then our bound is sharp. For such   and if also     2 we\r\nprove in Theorem 4.5 that 2H( ) is isolated in the range of the height.\r\nStarting from chapter 6 we work in an algebraic torus of arbitrary dimension. Algebraic\r\nsubgroups can still be described by a finite set of monomial equations. For example\r\n(x1, . . . , xn) 2 Gn\r\nm(C) is contained in a proper algebraic subgroup if and only if the xi\r\n\r\nsatisfy a non-trivial multiplicative relation. In [BMZ99] Bombieri, Masser, and Zannier\r\nproved that if X is an irreducible curve which is not contained in the translate of a\r\nproper algebraic subgroup, then points on X that lie in a proper algebraic subgroup have\r\nbounded height. Moreover, they showed that this statement is false if X is contained in\r\nthe translate of a proper algebraic subgroup. The authors also showed that there are\r\nonly finitely many points on X that lie in an algebraic subgroup of codimension at least\r\n2. This finiteness result was generalized by the same authors in [BMZ03] to algebraic\r\ncurves defined over the field of complex numbers. Hence for curves it makes sense to\r\ntake X0 = X if X is not contained in the translate of a proper algebraic subgroup and\r\nX0 = ; else wise. But X00 is more subtle: we take X00 = X if X is not contained in a\r\nproper algebraic subgroup and X00 = ; else wise. The point in making this distinction is\r\nthat in [BMZ06a] the authors conjectured that X00 contains only finitely many points\r\nin an algebraic subgroup of codimension at least 2. They proved this conjecture for\r\nn   5. Recently, in [Mau06] Maurin gave a proof for all n.\r\nLet X   Gn\r\nm be an irreducible subvariety, not necessarily a curve. In the higher\r\ndimensional case we finally need a definition of X0: we get X0 by removing from X\r\nall positive dimension subvarieties that show up in an improper component of the intersection\r\nof X with the translate of an algebraic subgroup. The definition of X00 is\r\nsimilar but we require the translates of algebraic subgroups to be algebraic subgroups.\r\nIn [BMZ06b] Bombieri, Masser, and Zannier showed that X0 is Zariski open in X.\r\nLet h be the absolute logarithmic Weil height. Our contribution in chapter 6 is\r\nTheorem 6.1 where we give an explicit bound for the height of algebraic points p in X0\r\nthat lie “uniformly close” to an algebraic subgroup of codimension strictly greater than\r\nn − n/ dimX. By uniformly close we mean that there exist an   > 0, independent of p,\r\nand an a in an algebraic subgroup of said codimension with h(pa−1)    . Actually, in\r\nTheorem 6.1 we will use a weaker notion of uniformly close. The terminology comes from\r\nthe fact that the map (p, a) 7! h(pa−1) has similar properties as a distance function.\r\nFor example it satisfies the triangle inequality. This notion of distance was considered\r\nby several authors ([Eve02], [Poo99], [R´em03]) in connection with subgroups of finite\r\nrank.\r\nTheorem 6.1 generalizes the Bounded Height Theorem for curves by Bombieri,\r\nMasser, and Zannier. We state our theorem such that it also gives an explicit version\r\nof a Theorem of Bombieri and Zannier in [Zan00] on the intersection of varieties with\r\none dimensional subgroups. To do this we will need a slightly more general definition\r\nof X0 which is provided in chapter 6.\r\nThe height upper bound in Theorem 6.1 involves, along with n, the degree and\r\nheight of the variety X. We define these two notions in chapter 5. In simple terms, the\r\nheight of X controls the heights of the coefficients of a certain set of defining equations\r\nfor X whereas the degree of X controls their degrees. Just as in the second proof for\r\nheight bounds on curves given in [BMZ99], our proof of Theorem 6.1 uses ideas from\r\nthe geometry of numbers. Given p 2 X(Q) uniformly close to an algebraic subgroup we\r\nconstruct a new algebraic subgroup H of codimension dimX and controlled degree, such\r\nthat pH has normalized height small compared to the height of p. We then intersect\r\n\r\npH with X. The Arithmetic B´ezout Theorem bounds the height of isolated points in\r\nthis intersection leading to an explicit height bound for p.\r\nLehmer-type lower bounds for heights in spirit of Dobrowolski’s Theorem and its\r\ngeneralization to higher dimension provide a method for deducing finiteness results from\r\nheight bounds as given in chapter 6. This method was used together with algebraic number\r\ntheory in Bombieri, Masser, and Zannier’s article [BMZ99] to prove the finiteness\r\nof the set of points on X0 in an algebraic subgroup of codimension at least 2 if X is a\r\ncurve. Meanwhile, their intricate argument has been simplified in [BMZ04] by applying\r\na more advanced height lower bound due to Amoroso and David [AD04]. In this\r\nlower bound the degree over Q of a point is essentially replaced by its degree over the\r\nmaximal abelian extension of Q. Using this approach we show in Corollary 6.2 that if\r\nX is a surface in G5\r\nm, then there are only finitely many points on X0 contained in an\r\nalgebraic subgroup of codimension at least 3. Thus we have finiteness for the correct\r\nsubgroup size at least in an isolated case.\r\nEven in presence of a uniform height bound as in Theorem 6.1, the approaches in\r\n[BMZ99] and [BMZ04] cannot be used to prove the finiteness of the set of p 2 X0(Q)\r\nwith h(pa−1) small and a contained in an algebraic subgroups of appropriate dimension:\r\nalthough pa−1 has small height, its degree cannot be controlled. In chapter 7 we pursue\r\na new approach using a Bogomolov-type height lower bound. This bound was proved by\r\nAmoroso and David in [AD03]; it bounds from below the height of a generic point on a\r\nvariety not equal to the translate of an algebraic subgroup. The main result of chapter\r\n7 is Theorem 7.1: we show that for B 2 R there exists an   =  (X,B) > 0 with the\r\nfollowing property: there are only finitely many p 2 X0(Q) with h(pa−1)     where a is\r\ncontained in an algebraic subgroup of dimension strictly less than m(dimX, n). In other\r\nwords, there are only finitely many algebraic points on X0 of bounded height which are\r\nuniformly close to an algebraic subgroup of dimension less than m(dimX, n). Just as\r\nwas the case in Theorem 6.1 we actually use a relaxed version of uniformly close in\r\nTheorem 7.1. The somewhat unnatural function m(·, ·) is defined in (7.1.1). At least in\r\nthe case of curves we have n − 2 < m(1, n) and so we can take the subgroups to have\r\nthe best possible dimension n−2. Unfortunately this is the only interesting case where\r\nm(r, n) > n − r − 1.\r\nWith the height upper bound from chapter 6 we can deduce a corollary to Theorem\r\n7.1 which proves finiteness independently of B and where the subgroup dimension is\r\nstrictly less than min{n/ dimX,m(dimX, n)}. Let X be a curve, then this result is\r\noptimal with respect to the subgroup dimension. Let us assume that X is not contained\r\nin the translate of a proper algebraic subgroup, hence X0 = X. Then our corollary says\r\nthat there are only finitely many algebraic points on X that are close to an algebraic\r\nsubgroup of codimension at least 2. Moreover, in Corollary 7.2 we use Dobrowolski’s\r\nTheorem to show that if   in the definition of uniformly close is small enough, then\r\nall points on X close to an algebraic subgroup of codimension at least 2 are actually\r\ncontained in such a subgroup.\r\n\r\nWe now shift our focus from the algebraic torus to abelian varieties: we want to study\r\nthe intersection X0(Q)\\A[r] where A is an abelian variety and X is an irreducible closed\r\nsubvariety of A. The definitions of X0 and X00 make sense in the abelian setting and\r\nare completely analog to the multiplicative case.\r\nLet X be a curve, then in [Via03] Viada proved that X0(Q)\\A[1] has bounded height\r\nif A is a power of an elliptic curve. If the elliptic curve has complex multiplication she\r\nalso proved that X0(Q)\\A[2] is finite. R´emond in [R´em05b] generalized Viada’s height\r\nbound to any abelian variety. In [R´em07] R´emond applied a generalization of Vojta’s\r\ninequality which he proved in [R´em05a] and in Theorem 1.2 showed boundedness of\r\nheight of (X(Q)\\Z(r)\r\nX )\\A[r]. Here X\\Z(r)\r\nX   X is a new deprived subset which depends\r\non r. In fact his result holds for a set larger than A[r] involving also the division closure\r\nof finitely generated group. If A is isogenous to a product of elliptic curves and if X is a\r\nsufficiently general surface which is not contained in the translate of a proper algebraic\r\nsubgroup then X\\Z(r)\r\nX is non-empty and Zariski open in X for r   (dimA + 3)/2.\r\nIn [RV03], R´emond and Viada proved that if X is a curve then X00(Q) \\ A[2] is\r\nfinite if A is a power of an elliptic curve E with complex multiplication. In a recent\r\npreprint, Viada [Via07] announced the finiteness of X00(Q) \\ A[3] for unrestricted E,\r\nthe optimal subgroup codimension 2 is thus just missed.\r\nWe announce the following result called the Bounded Height Theorem: if A = Eg\r\nis a power of an elliptic curve E and X is an irreducible closed subvariety of arbitrary\r\ndimension, then X0(Q) \\ A[dimX] has bounded N´eron-Tate height. Also, using a result\r\nfrom Kirby’s Thesis [Kir06] and ideas from Bombieri, Masser, and Zannier’s [BMZ06b]\r\none can show that X0 is Zariski open and give a criterion on X to decide when X0 is\r\nnon-empty. Using height lower bounds on abelian varieties with complex multiplication\r\ndue to Ratazzi in [Rat07] we can use the Bounded Height Theorem to show that\r\nX0(Q)\\A[dimX+1] is finite if E has complex multiplication. For an elliptic curve without\r\ncomplex multiplication, finiteness of X0(Q)\\A[r] can also be obtained, using for example\r\nR´emond’s Theorem 2.1 from [R´em05b]. But r is in general sub-optimal for such elliptic\r\ncurves.\r\nThe essential difference between the Bounded Height Theorem and Theorem 6.1 is\r\nthat the subgroups are now allowed to have the best-possible codimension dimX for all\r\nX.\r\nIn the future we plan to publish these results.\r\nPink has stated a general conjecture on mixed Shimura varieties, see [Pin05a] and\r\n[Pin05b]. One special implication is his Conjecture 5.1 from [Pin05b]: if A is a semiabelian\r\nvariety defined over C and if X   A is a subvariety also defined over C which is\r\nnot contained in a proper algebraic subgroup of A, then X(C)\\A[dimX+1] is not Zariski\r\ndense in X. Zilber’s stronger Conjecture 2 in [Zil02] implies the same conclusion. With\r\nthe Bounded Height Theorem we can prove this assertion under the following stronger\r\nhypothesis on A and X: A is a power of an elliptic curve E with complex multiplication\r\nand if ' : Eg ! EdimX is a surjective homomorphism of algebraic groups, then the\r\nrestriction '|X : X ! EdimX is dominant.\r\n\r\nThe proof of the Bounded Height Theorem uses the completeness of A (and X)\r\nin an essential way as it relies on intersection theory. Nevertheless, a proof for the\r\nboundedness of height of X0(Q)\\A[dimX] for the non-complete X   A = Gn\r\nm along the\r\nlines of the proof of the Bounded Height Theorem must not be ruled out. For instance\r\none could compactify Gn\r\nm ,! Pn and work in Pn. Still, there seems to be no suitable\r\nTheorem of the Cube for Gn\r\nm. Future research could consist in finding a proof of the\r\nBounded Height Theorem in the multiplicative case or in abelian varieties other than a\r\npower of an elliptic curve.\r\nIn the two appendices we leave the main path of the thesis. Let P be an irreducible\r\npolynomial in two variables with algebraic coefficients. Say x and y are algebraic with\r\nP(x, y) = 0. In appendix A, motivated by Proposition B of [BMZ99], we consider the\r\nproblem of bounding | degX(P)h(x)−degY (P)h(y)| explicitly and with good dependency\r\nin h(x), h(y), and P.\r\nFor simple examples such as P = Xp − Y q with p and q coprime integers, the\r\nabsolute value is zero. But for general and fixed P it may even be unbounded as (x, y)\r\nruns over all algebraic solutions of P. In Theorem A.1 we prove an upper bound which is\r\nof the form c max{1, hp(P)}1/2 max{1, h(x), h(y)}1/2 where the constant c is completely\r\nexplicit and depends only on the partial degrees of P. Here hp(P) is the projective\r\nlogarithmic Weil height of the coefficient vector of P. This type of height inequality is\r\noften referred to as quasi-equivalence of heights.\r\nIn appendix B we demonstrate four known results using the Quasi-equivalence Theorem\r\nfrom appendix A. The first application is the Theorem of Bombieri, Masser, and\r\nZannier, already discussed above, in the case of curves in G2\r\nm. We then prove a version\r\nof Runge’s Theorem on the finiteness of the number of solutions of certain diophantine\r\nequations. Next we show a result of Skolem from 1929: we first generalize the greatest\r\ncommon divisor of pairs of integers to pairs of algebraic numbers. We then show that\r\nif x and y are coprime algebraic numbers and P(x, y) = 0 where P is an irreducible\r\npolynomial in Q[X, Y ] without constant term, then x and y have uniformly bounded\r\nheight. This result has been proved independently by Abouzaid in [Abo06] who used it\r\nto prove a variant of the Quasi-equivalence Theorem. The fourth and final application\r\nis an explicit version of Sprindzhuk’s Theorem: let P have rational coefficients, again\r\nwithout constant term and such that not both partial derivatives of P vanish at (0, 0).\r\nThen for a sufficiently large prime l, the polynomial P(l, Y ) 2 Q[Y ] is irreducible. Since\r\nthe Quasi-equivalence Theorem gives explicit bounds, so do its four applications.\r\nChapters 1 and 5 contain no new results but serve as reference for certain theorems\r\nwhich we apply in the rest of the thesis. Chapter 1 introduces the Weil height and\r\nrelated subjects. It is used throughout the thesis. Chapter 5 contains some results from\r\nalgebraic geometry and gives a definition for the height of a positive dimensional variety.\r\nThese definitions and results will be used in the second part of the thesis, chapters 6\r\nand 7.",
  "texts" : [ "Heights and multiplicative relations on algebraic varieties", "Points on a subvariety X of a semi-abelian variety A that are contained in a subgroup,\r\nlet the subgroup be of finite rank or algebraic, are subject to severe restrictions\r\narithmetical nature.\r\nFiniteness results for intersections of X with subgroups of finite rank have been studied\r\nby Faltings, Hindry, Laurent, McQuillan, Raynaud, Vojta and others. More recently\r\nseveral authors ([CZ00], [BMZ99], [BMZ03], [BMZ06a], [BMZ06b], [BMZ04],\r\n[Via03], [RV03], [R´em05b], [R´em07], [Pin05b], [Zan00], [Zil02], [Mau06]) have\r\nconsidered the intersection of X with A[r], the set of complex points in A contained in\r\nan algebraic subgroup of codimension greater or equal to r. If H is a fixed algebraic\r\nsubgroup of A with codimension strictly less than dimX, then a dimension counting\r\nargument shows that X\\H is either empty or contains a curve. As we are allowing H to\r\nvary with fixed codimension, the intersection X \\ A[r] may be quite large if r < dimX.\r\nIn this thesis we are only interested in the case r   dimX.\r\nIf not stated otherwise we will also assume throughout the introduction that all\r\nvarieties are defined over Q, the field of algebraic numbers. One can define a height\r\nfunction on the set of algebraic points of A. Throughout this thesis we work only in\r\nthe algebraic torus Gn\r\nm or an abelian variety. So we can take the Weil height or the\r\nN´eron-Tate height associated to an ample line bundle.\r\nWe will pursue two types of questions. First, for which r does the set X0(Q) \\ A[r]\r\nhave bounded height and how do these bounds depend on X? Second, for which r is the\r\nset X00(Q) \\ A[r] finite? Here X0 and X00 are obtained from removing from X certain\r\nsubvarieties in order to to eliminate trivial counterexamples. For example if X is a\r\nproper algebraic subgroup of Gn\r\nm with positive dimension, then there is no hope for a\r\nboundedness of height or finiteness result for U(Q) \\ (Gn\r\nm)[r] if r   dimX and if U is\r\nZariski open and dense in X. In this case X0 and X00 are both empty.\r\nThe simplest non-trivial example seems to be the curve defined by x + y = 1 in\r\nG2\r\nm. Here we can take X0 and X00 to equal our curve. Algebraic subgroups of G2\r\nm\r\ncan be described by at most two monomial relations x y  = 1 with integer exponents\r\n  and  . For subgroups of dimension 1, one non-trivial relation suffices. If (x, y) is\r\ncontained in such a subgroup then x and y are called multiplicatively dependent. Hence\r\nthe intersection of our curve with the union of all proper algebraic subgroups of G2\r\nm can\r\nbe described by the solutions of\r\n(0.0.1) x (1 − x)  = 1.\r\n\r\nThis is an equation in three unknowns x,  , and  , so one should not expect finitely\r\nmany solutions. Indeed, taking x 6= 1 a root of unity gives infinitely many solutions.\r\nIn [CZ00] Cohen and Zannier showed that if H denotes the absolute non-logarithmic\r\nWeil height then (0.0.1) implies the sharp inequality max{H(x),H(1−x)}   2. In chapter\r\n2 we start off by giving an alternative proof of Cohen and Zannier’s Theorem. We\r\neven show that the possibly larger height H(x, 1−x) is at most 2. In their paper, Cohen\r\nand Zannier also proved that 2 is an isolated point in the range of max{H(x),H(1−x)}.\r\nWe make this result explicit in Theorem 2.2, working instead with H(x, 1 − x). The\r\nproof applies Smyth’s Theorem on lower bounds for heights of non-reciprocal algebraic\r\nnumbers and a Theorem of Mignotte.\r\nAs was already noticed in [CZ00], solutions of (0.0.1) are closely linked to roots of\r\ncertain trinomials whose coefficients are roots of unity. In chapter 3 Theorem 3.2 we\r\nfollow this avenue by factoring such trinomials over cyclotomic fields. Having essentially\r\na minimal polynomial in our hands, we obtain a new proof for the boundedness of\r\nH(x, 1 − x) with x as in (0.0.1). More importantly, in Theorem 3.1 we show that not\r\nonly is 2 isolated in the range of the height function, but also that H(x, 1−x) converges\r\nto an absolute constant if [Q(x) : Q] goes to infinity. The proof determines the value\r\nof this limit: it is the Mahler measure of the two-variable polynomial X + Y − 1. In a\r\ncertain sense this Mahler measure is the height of the curve in our problem.\r\nIn Theorem 3.3 we prove a conjecture of Masser stated in [Mas07]: the number\r\nof solutions of (0.0.1) with [Q(x) : Q]   D is asymptotically equal to c0D3 with c0 =\r\n2.06126 . . . as D ! 1. The constant c0 is defined properly in chapter 3 as a converging\r\nseries. This counting result is a further application of Theorem 3.2.\r\nIn chapter 4 we generalize the method from chapter 2 to bound the height of multiplicatively\r\ndependent solutions of\r\n(0.0.2) x + y =  .\r\nHere   is now any non-zero algebraic number. In [BMZ99] Bombieri, Masser, and\r\nZannier prove a more general result which also implies boundedness of height in this\r\ncase. Their Proposition A leads to an explicit upper bound for the height; the bound\r\nis polynomial in H( ). We are mainly interested in upper bounds for H(x, y) which\r\nhave good dependency in H( ). The value H( ) can be regarded as the height of\r\nthe defining equation (0.0.2). In Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 we get the bound H(x, y)   2H( ) min{H( ), 7 log(3H( ))}. By Theorem 4.3 the exponent of the logarithm cannot\r\nbe less than 1. But in some special cases, e.g. if   is a rational integer, we improve the\r\nupper bound to 2H( ), see Theorem 4.4. In this theorem we also show that if   is a\r\nrational integer then 2H( ) is attained as a height if and only if   is a power of two.\r\nThus if   is a power of two, then our bound is sharp. For such   and if also     2 we\r\nprove in Theorem 4.5 that 2H( ) is isolated in the range of the height.\r\nStarting from chapter 6 we work in an algebraic torus of arbitrary dimension. Algebraic\r\nsubgroups can still be described by a finite set of monomial equations. For example\r\n(x1, . . . , xn) 2 Gn\r\nm(C) is contained in a proper algebraic subgroup if and only if the xi\r\n\r\nsatisfy a non-trivial multiplicative relation. In [BMZ99] Bombieri, Masser, and Zannier\r\nproved that if X is an irreducible curve which is not contained in the translate of a\r\nproper algebraic subgroup, then points on X that lie in a proper algebraic subgroup have\r\nbounded height. Moreover, they showed that this statement is false if X is contained in\r\nthe translate of a proper algebraic subgroup. The authors also showed that there are\r\nonly finitely many points on X that lie in an algebraic subgroup of codimension at least\r\n2. This finiteness result was generalized by the same authors in [BMZ03] to algebraic\r\ncurves defined over the field of complex numbers. Hence for curves it makes sense to\r\ntake X0 = X if X is not contained in the translate of a proper algebraic subgroup and\r\nX0 = ; else wise. But X00 is more subtle: we take X00 = X if X is not contained in a\r\nproper algebraic subgroup and X00 = ; else wise. The point in making this distinction is\r\nthat in [BMZ06a] the authors conjectured that X00 contains only finitely many points\r\nin an algebraic subgroup of codimension at least 2. They proved this conjecture for\r\nn   5. Recently, in [Mau06] Maurin gave a proof for all n.\r\nLet X   Gn\r\nm be an irreducible subvariety, not necessarily a curve.

Our contribution in chapter 6 is\r\nTheorem 6.1 where we give an explicit bound for the height of algebraic points p in X0\r\nthat lie “uniformly close” to an algebraic subgroup of codimension strictly greater than\r\nn − n/ dimX.

The main result of chapter\r\n7 is Theorem 7.1: we show that for B 2 R there exists an   =  (X,B) > 0 with the\r\nfollowing property: there are only finitely many p 2 X0(Q) with h(pa−1)     where a is\r\ncontained in an algebraic subgroup of dimension strictly less than m(dimX, n). In other\r\nwords, there are only finitely many algebraic points on X0 of bounded height which are\r\nuniformly close to an algebraic subgroup of dimension less than m(dimX, n). Just as\r\nwas the case in Theorem 6.1 we actually use a relaxed version of uniformly close in\r\nTheorem 7.1. The somewhat unnatural function m(·, ·) is defined in (7.1.1). At least in\r\nthe case of curves we have n − 2 < m(1, n) and so we can take the subgroups to have\r\nthe best possible dimension n−2. Unfortunately this is the only interesting case where\r\nm(r, n) > n − r − 1.\r\nWith the height upper bound from chapter 6 we can deduce a corollary to Theorem\r\n7.1 which proves finiteness independently of B and where the subgroup dimension is\r\nstrictly less than min{n/ dimX,m(dimX, n)}. Let X be a curve, then this result is\r\noptimal with respect to the subgroup dimension. Let us assume that X is not contained\r\nin the translate of a proper algebraic subgroup, hence X0 = X. Then our corollary says\r\nthat there are only finitely many algebraic points on X that are close to an algebraic\r\nsubgroup of codimension at least 2. Moreover, in Corollary 7.2 we use Dobrowolski’s\r\nTheorem to show that if   in the definition of uniformly close is small enough, then\r\nall points on X close to an algebraic subgroup of codimension at least 2 are actually\r\ncontained in such a subgroup.\r\n\r\nWe now shift our focus from the algebraic torus to abelian varieties: we want to study\r\nthe intersection X0(Q)\\A[r] where A is an abelian variety and X is an irreducible closed\r\nsubvariety of A. The definitions of X0 and X00 make sense in the abelian setting and\r\nare completely analog to the multiplicative case.\r\nLet X be a curve, then in [Via03] Viada proved that X0(Q)\\A[1] has bounded height\r\nif A is a power of an elliptic curve. If the elliptic curve has complex multiplication she\r\nalso proved that X0(Q)\\A[2] is finite. R´emond in [R´em05b] generalized Viada’s height\r\nbound to any abelian variety. In [R´em07] R´emond applied a generalization of Vojta’s\r\ninequality which he proved in [R´em05a] and in Theorem 1.2 showed boundedness of\r\nheight of (X(Q)\\Z(r)\r\nX )\\A[r]. Here X\\Z(r)\r\nX   X is a new deprived subset which depends\r\non r. In fact his result holds for a set larger than A[r] involving also the division closure\r\nof finitely generated group. If A is isogenous to a product of elliptic curves and if X is a\r\nsufficiently general surface which is not contained in the translate of a proper algebraic\r\nsubgroup then X\\Z(r)\r\nX is non-empty and Zariski open in X for r   (dimA + 3)/2.\r\nIn [RV03], R´emond and Viada proved that if X is a curve then X00(Q) \\ A[2] is\r\nfinite if A is a power of an elliptic curve E with complex multiplication. In a recent\r\npreprint, Viada [Via07] announced the finiteness of X00(Q) \\ A[3] for unrestricted E,\r\nthe optimal subgroup codimension 2 is thus just missed.\r\nWe announce the following result called the Bounded Height Theorem: if A = Eg\r\nis a power of an elliptic curve E and X is an irreducible closed subvariety of arbitrary\r\ndimension, then X0(Q) \\ A[dimX] has bounded N´eron-Tate height. Also, using a result\r\nfrom Kirby’s Thesis [Kir06] and ideas from Bombieri, Masser, and Zannier’s [BMZ06b]\r\none can show that X0 is Zariski open and give a criterion on X to decide when X0 is\r\nnon-empty. Using height lower bounds on abelian varieties with complex multiplication\r\ndue to Ratazzi in [Rat07] we can use the Bounded Height Theorem to show that\r\nX0(Q)\\A[dimX+1] is finite if E has complex multiplication. For an elliptic curve without\r\ncomplex multiplication, finiteness of X0(Q)\\A[r] can also be obtained, using for example\r\nR´emond’s Theorem 2.1 from [R´em05b]. But r is in general sub-optimal for such elliptic\r\ncurves.\r\nThe essential difference between the Bounded Height Theorem and Theorem 6.1 is\r\nthat the subgroups are now allowed to have the best-possible codimension dimX for all\r\nX.\r\nIn the future we plan to publish these results.\r\nPink has stated a general conjecture on mixed Shimura varieties, see [Pin05a] and\r\n[Pin05b]. One special implication is his Conjecture 5.1 from [Pin05b]: if A is a semiabelian\r\nvariety defined over C and if X   A is a subvariety also defined over C which is\r\nnot contained in a proper algebraic subgroup of A, then X(C)\\A[dimX+1] is not Zariski\r\ndense in X. Zilber’s stronger Conjecture 2 in [Zil02] implies the same conclusion. With\r\nthe Bounded Height Theorem we can prove this assertion under the following stronger\r\nhypothesis on A and X: A is a power of an elliptic curve E with complex multiplication\r\nand if ' : Eg ! EdimX is a surjective homomorphism of algebraic groups, then the\r\nrestriction '|X : X ! EdimX is dominant.\r\n\r\nThe proof of the Bounded Height Theorem uses the completeness of A (and X)\r\nin an essential way as it relies on intersection theory. Nevertheless, a proof for the\r\nboundedness of height of X0(Q)\\A[dimX] for the non-complete X   A = Gn\r\nm along the\r\nlines of the proof of the Bounded Height Theorem must not be ruled out. For instance\r\none could compactify Gn\r\nm ,! Pn and work in Pn. Still, there seems to be no suitable\r\nTheorem of the Cube for Gn\r\nm. Future research could consist in finding a proof of the\r\nBounded Height Theorem in the multiplicative case or in abelian varieties other than a\r\npower of an elliptic curve.\r\nIn the two appendices we leave the main path of the thesis. Let P be an irreducible\r\npolynomial in two variables with algebraic coefficients. Say x and y are algebraic with\r\nP(x, y) = 0. In appendix A, motivated by Proposition B of [BMZ99], we consider the\r\nproblem of bounding | degX(P)h(x)−degY (P)h(y)| explicitly and with good dependency\r\nin h(x), h(y), and P.\r\nFor simple examples such as P = Xp − Y q with p and q coprime integers, the\r\nabsolute value is zero. But for general and fixed P it may even be unbounded as (x, y)\r\nruns over all algebraic solutions of P. In Theorem A.1 we prove an upper bound which is\r\nof the form c max{1, hp(P)}1/2 max{1, h(x), h(y)}1/2 where the constant c is completely\r\nexplicit and depends only on the partial degrees of P. Here hp(P) is the projective\r\nlogarithmic Weil height of the coefficient vector of P. This type of height inequality is\r\noften referred to as quasi-equivalence of heights.\r\nIn appendix B we demonstrate four known results using the Quasi-equivalence Theorem\r\nfrom appendix A. The first application is the Theorem of Bombieri, Masser, and\r\nZannier, already discussed above, in the case of curves in G2\r\nm. We then prove a version\r\nof Runge’s Theorem on the finiteness of the number of solutions of certain diophantine\r\nequations. Next we show a result of Skolem from 1929: we first generalize the greatest\r\ncommon divisor of pairs of integers to pairs of algebraic numbers. We then show that\r\nif x and y are coprime algebraic numbers and P(x, y) = 0 where P is an irreducible\r\npolynomial in Q[X, Y ] without constant term, then x and y have uniformly bounded\r\nheight. This result has been proved independently by Abouzaid in [Abo06] who used it\r\nto prove a variant of the Quasi-equivalence Theorem. The fourth and final application\r\nis an explicit version of Sprindzhuk’s Theorem: let P have rational coefficients, again\r\nwithout constant term and such that not both partial derivatives of P vanish at (0, 0).\r\nThen for a sufficiently large prime l, the polynomial P(l, Y ) 2 Q[Y ] is irreducible. Since\r\nthe Quasi-equivalence Theorem gives explicit bounds, so do its four applications.\r\nChapters 1 and 5 contain no new results but serve as reference for certain theorems\r\nwhich we apply in the rest of the thesis. Chapter 1 introduces the Weil height and\r\nrelated subjects. It is used throughout the thesis. Chapter 5 contains some results from\r\nalgebraic geometry and gives a definition for the height of a positive dimensional variety.\r\nThese definitions and results will be used in the second part of the thesis, chapters 6\r\nand 7.", null ],

  "title" : "The role of Beta1 integrins in the control of Mammary Epithelial Cell proliferation",
  "description" : "The cell fate of proliferation is used as an end point for many studies, particularly in cancer research.  Primary mammary epithelial cells (MECs) are a common model in breast cancer research and MEC proliferation is limited to a few days which make it very difficult to study longer term.  I describe the establishment of a new culture system to allow the analysis of cultures of primary luminal MECs over many days. Culturing the cells in a 3D microenvironment directly following tissue extraction, isolating the 3D acini using PBS/EDTA and replating onto 2D surface to study proliferation, maintained the 3D in vivo proliferation potential of the cells. Manipulation of the cellular environment, using this novel method, can maintain the proliferative potential of primary MECs. Our data further reveals that the cellular environment has profound effects on the proliferative properties of the primary MECs and is dominant over growth factors. This novel methodology, to increase the proliferation window, will allow the use of MECs over a longer time period and was used to elucidate the mechanism by which β1 integrins regulate the proliferation in MECs.Integrins are required for cell cycle progression in epithelia, but the β-integrin subunits involved and the downstream mechanisms are not known. A CreERTM strategy was used to specifically delete the β1-integrin gene in situ from primary cultures of MECs. This resulted in a block of DNA synthesis. Despite the loss of β1-integrins, no changes in cell shape, focal adhesion integrity or the ability of the cells to migrate were observed. In β1-integrin null cells, β3-integrin was expressed de novo, it associated with core adhesome components, and maintained focal adhesion signalling as determined by the presence of phospho-FAK and phospho-paxillin. β3-integrin adhesions were unable to support Rac activation and nuclear translocation of ERK. This investigation reveals that β1-integrins are uniquely required for cell cycle progression in breast epithelia, but not for their migration. Thus, the control of epithelial cell fate is dependent on the signalling pathways that emanate from specific β-integrin mediated adhesions.Disorganised morphology, in addition to uncontrolled proliferation, is a typical feature of human breast cancer.  Associated with this aberrant morphology is a deregulation of integrin adhesion receptors.  We investigated the role of β1-integrin in the MCF10a breast cancer progression model; a series of increasingly transformed cell lines from a common genetic background.  The cell lines of the MCF10a progression series were grown in a 3D basement membrane culture, in which they formed complex disorganised multi-acinar structures, except the control normal MCF10a MEC cell line, which formed hollow acini.  Analysing β1-integrin expression using flow cytometry, showed similar surface expression levels, however confocal microscopy revealed different β1-integrin localisation in the malignant cell lines compared to the normal ones.  Treating the MCF10a progression panel cell lines with AIIB2, a β1 integrin inhibitory antibody resulted in the morphology of the treated 3D colonies becoming more compact, smaller, and similar to the MCF10a normal cells.  All in all, the results presented in this thesis show the critical importance of integrins in regulating proliferation in MECs, the mechanism by which integrins exert this control and the role that this may have in breast cancer tumourigenesis.",
  "texts" : [ "The role of Beta1 integrins in the control of Mammary Epithelial Cell proliferation", "The cell fate of proliferation is used as an end point for many studies, particularly in cancer research.  Primary mammary epithelial cells (MECs) are a common model in breast cancer research and MEC proliferation is limited to a few days which make it very difficult to study longer term.  I describe the establishment of a new culture system to allow the analysis of cultures of primary luminal MECs over many days. Culturing the cells in a 3D microenvironment directly following tissue extraction, isolating the 3D acini using PBS/EDTA and replating onto 2D surface to study proliferation, maintained the 3D in vivo proliferation potential of the cells. Manipulation of the cellular environment, using this novel method, can maintain the proliferative potential of primary MECs. Our data further reveals that the cellular environment has profound effects on the proliferative properties of the primary MECs and is dominant over growth factors.

  "title" : "Experimental petrology of basalts\r\nand their source rocks",
  "description" : "This volume is concerned with the basaltic effluent\r\nfrom planetary interiors, and this chapter is concerned\r\nwith the extent to which experimental petrology of\r\nbasalts can inform us about the composition and mineralogy\r\nof the source material within the interiors of\r\nplanets. If the compositions of sources can be deduced\r\nusing the experimental petrology of basalts, or in any\r\nother way (Chapter 4), then the relationship between\r\nsource rock and basaltic magma can be investigated by\r\ncomplementary experiments using the proposed source\r\nmaterial. Basaltic volcanism appears to be a characteristic\r\nfeature of most investigated planetary surfaces (Chapters\r\n2 and 5), with basalts being produced either when\r\ninternal temperatures become high enough to cause\r\npartial melting of the planetary rock, or when impacts\r\nby other bodies raise the temperature high enough to\r\ncause partial or complete melting of near-surface rocks.\r\nThe main variables to be considered in these processes\r\nare the pressure and equivalent depth, the temperature,\r\nand the composition and mineralogy of the planetary\r\ninterior and near-surface rocks.\r\nOf these three variables, the value of pressure as a\r\nfunction of depth is the best known. A given pressure is\r\nachieved at depths that vary considerably from one\r\nplanetary body to another as illustrated in Fig. 3.1.1.\r\nTemperature is a variable that changes as a function\r\nof time, and as a function of process (Chapter 9).\r\nConvective movements within a planet, for example,\r\ninfluence both the rate of heat transport to the surface,\r\n0\r\nand the development of regional variations in temperature\r\ndistribution versus depth. The temperature produced\r\nby meteoritic or planetesimal bombardment\r\ndepends upon the mass, velocity, and frequency of\r\nimpacting bodies. Variations reviewed in Chapter 9\r\nindicate the extent of our uncertainty about the temperatures\r\nof planetary interiors, even for our own planet.\r\nFigure 3.1.2 shows three geotherms that have been\r\nproposed for a convecting mantle within the present\r\nEarth (Solomon, 1976). The geotherms drawn for the\r\nlithosphere (shallower than about 100 km) are passed\r\nthrough the zones plotted by Solomon ( 1976) for values\r\nestimated from study of peridotite nodules from the\r\nmantle; these geotherms are similar to those calculated\r\nfor conduction models (e.g., Clark and Ringwood,\r\n1964). Temperatures in a region of upwelling, beneath\r\nocean ridges for example, are higher than temperatures\r\nbeneath normal ocean plates. The temperatures shown\r\nbeneath shield and ocean plates become identical at 200\r\nkm depth (contrast Jordan, 1975).\r\nThe third variable, the composition and mineralogy\r\nof basalt source regions, is what we seek to determine\r\nfrom experimental petrology of erupted basalts.\r\nFor the Earth, however, we already have a fairly well-defined\r\nmodel for the structure and petrology of the\r\nmantle, based on cosmochemistry, geophysics, and\r\npetrology (Chapter 4). The composition corresponds to\r\nthat of a peridotite dominated at low pressures by olivine\r\nand two pyroxene minerals. Figure 3.1.2 outlines the\r\nmain phase relationships for this material up to pressures of 250 kb, corresponding to a depth of 700 km\r\nwithin the Earth. For other planetary bodies dominated\r\nby the components of olivine and pyroxenes, the phase\r\nrelationships would be similar, but the specific depth\r\nscales would differ (Fig. 3.1.1 ).\r\nBasaltic magmas are generated within the melting\r\ninterval (crystals + liquid), when the temperature\r\nbecomes high enough to cross the solidus. According\r\nto the terrestrial geotherms given in Fig. 3.1.2, melting\r\ndoes not occur at all beneath shield and ocean plates,\r\nand therefore some special circumstance is required\r\nto increase the temperature locally to account for the\r\noceanic volcanoes and the continental flood basalts. It\r\nis generally assumed that upward convection of mantle\r\nmaterial raises the temperature at relatively shallow\r\nlevels, as indicated by the geotherm associated with\r\nmantle upwelling beneath ocean ridges in Fig. 3.1.2. In\r\nthis tectonic environment, a geotherm crosses the solidus\r\nat depths of 70 ± 40 km (sections 3.3.7 and 3.3.8).\r\nEach planetary body has characteristics that dis- ,\r\ntinguish it from the others, even if it should turn out that\r\nmost of them have similar major element compositions.\r\nThe different pressure-depth relationships suggest that\r\ntemperature distribution curves are likely to intersect\r\nsolidus curves at different pressures on the different\r\nbodies. The phase relationships shown in Fig. 3.1.2\r\nmay be changed by variations in Fe, Mg, Ca, and Al\r\nproportions, and changed radically by the addition of\r\nvolatile components (sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3). For parts\r\nof the Earth's interior containing traces of CO_2 and\r\nH_2O, there is a wide interval of incipient melting below\r\nthe solidus plotted in Fig. 3.1.2. For the Moon, in\r\ncontrast, the concentration of volatile components\r\nappears to be negligible. The oxygen fugacity of lunar\r\nrocks is much lower than that of terrestrial rocks. Mars\r\nmay be enriched in Fe and S compared with Earth and\r\nMoon (McGetchin and Smyth, 1978). The occurrence\r\nof partial melting and volcanism depends upon the\r\nmaintenance of sufficiently high temperatures and thus\r\nupon the body's thermal history (Chapter 9). Parent\r\nbodies of basaltic achondrite meteorites are believed to\r\nhave solidified at an early stage in the development of\r\nthe solar system, and active volcanism on the Moon\r\nceased relatively early in its history. Mars appears to\r\nhave ceased evolving, and the Earth continues with\r\nactive volcanism caused to a large extent by the mass\r\nmovement associated with plate tectonics. Therefore, in\r\nconsidering the basaltic volcanism of each planetary\r\nbody, we have different characteristics, and different\r\nground rules for interpretation. The spectacular eruptions\r\non Io were not anticipated according to preexisting\r\nground rules. The purpose of this chapter is to outline the\r\nmethods used to determine whether a particular basalt\r\nis likely to contain direct information about its source\r\nregion by application of the methods of experimental\r\npetrology. In addition, the experimental work on terrestrial,\r\nlunar, and meteoritic basalts, as well as likely\r\nsource materials, will be reviewed to show the extent to\r\nwhich the link between the basalts and their source\r\nregions has been established, and to show the extent to\r\nwhich additional processes are responsible for the\r\nchemistry observed in the basalts. We will conclude that\r\nexperimental petrology does provide an internally consistent\r\nframework for understanding basalts as the melting\r\nproducts of ultrabasic mantle assemblages, and that\r\nlaboratory experiments can be used for the exercise of\r\ngoing back from basalt chemistry to source region constitution,\r\nprovided that certain conditions are satisfied.",
  "texts" : [ "Experimental petrology of basalts\r\nand their source rocks", "This volume is concerned with the basaltic effluent\r\nfrom planetary interiors, and this chapter is concerned\r\nwith the extent to which experimental petrology of\r\nbasalts can inform us about the composition and mineralogy\r\nof the source material within the interiors of\r\nplanets. If the compositions of sources can be deduced\r\nusing the experimental petrology of basalts, or in any\r\nother way (Chapter 4), then the relationship between\r\nsource rock and basaltic magma can be investigated by\r\ncomplementary experiments using the proposed source\r\nmaterial. Basaltic volcanism appears to be a characteristic\r\nfeature of most investigated planetary surfaces (Chapters\r\n2 and 5), with basalts being produced either when\r\ninternal temperatures become high enough to cause\r\npartial melting of the planetary rock, or when impacts\r\nby other bodies raise the temperature high enough to\r\ncause partial or complete melting of near-surface rocks.\r\nThe main variables to be considered in these processes\r\nare the pressure and equivalent depth, the temperature,\r\nand the composition and mineralogy of the planetary\r\ninterior and near-surface rocks.\r\nOf these three variables, the value of pressure as a\r\nfunction of depth is the best known. A given pressure is\r\nachieved at depths that vary considerably from one\r\nplanetary body to another as illustrated in Fig. 3.1.1.\r\nTemperature is a variable that changes as a function\r\nof time, and as a function of process (Chapter 9).\r\nConvective movements within a planet, for example,\r\ninfluence both the rate of heat transport to the surface,\r\n0\r\nand the development of regional variations in temperature\r\ndistribution versus depth. The temperature produced\r\nby meteoritic or planetesimal bombardment\r\ndepends upon the mass, velocity, and frequency of\r\nimpacting bodies. Variations reviewed in Chapter 9\r\nindicate the extent of our uncertainty about the temperatures\r\nof planetary interiors, even for our own planet.\r\nFigure 3.1.2 shows three geotherms that have been\r\nproposed for a convecting mantle within the present\r\nEarth (Solomon, 1976). The geotherms drawn for the\r\nlithosphere (shallower than about 100 km) are passed\r\nthrough the zones plotted by Solomon ( 1976) for values\r\nestimated from study of peridotite nodules from the\r\nmantle; these geotherms are similar to those calculated\r\nfor conduction models (e.g., Clark and Ringwood,\r\n1964). Temperatures in a region of upwelling, beneath\r\nocean ridges for example, are higher than temperatures\r\nbeneath normal ocean plates. The temperatures shown\r\nbeneath shield and ocean plates become identical at 200\r\nkm depth (contrast Jordan, 1975).\r\nThe third variable, the composition and mineralogy\r\nof basalt source regions, is what we seek to determine\r\nfrom experimental petrology of erupted basalts.\r\nFor the Earth, however, we already have a fairly well-defined\r\nmodel for the structure and petrology of the\r\nmantle, based on cosmochemistry, geophysics, and\r\npetrology (Chapter 4). The composition corresponds to\r\nthat of a peridotite dominated at low pressures by olivine\r\nand two pyroxene minerals. Figure 3.1.2 outlines the\r\nmain phase relationships for this material up to pressures of 250 kb, corresponding to a depth of 700 km\r\nwithin the Earth. For other planetary bodies dominated\r\nby the components of olivine and pyroxenes, the phase\r\nrelationships would be similar, but the specific depth\r\nscales would differ (Fig. 3.1.1 ).\r\nBasaltic magmas are generated within the melting\r\ninterval (crystals + liquid), when the temperature\r\nbecomes high enough to cross the solidus. According\r\nto the terrestrial geotherms given in Fig. 3.1.2, melting\r\ndoes not occur at all beneath shield and ocean plates,\r\nand therefore some special circumstance is required\r\nto increase the temperature locally to account for the\r\noceanic volcanoes and the continental flood basalts. It\r\nis generally assumed that upward convection of mantle\r\nmaterial raises the temperature at relatively shallow\r\nlevels, as indicated by the geotherm associated with\r\nmantle upwelling beneath ocean ridges in Fig. 3.1.2. In\r\nthis tectonic environment, a geotherm crosses the solidus\r\nat depths of 70 ± 40 km (sections 3.3.7 and 3.3.8).\r\nEach planetary body has characteristics that dis- ,\r\ntinguish it from the others, even if it should turn out that\r\nmost of them have similar major element compositions.\r\nThe different pressure-depth relationships suggest that\r\ntemperature distribution curves are likely to intersect\r\nsolidus curves at different pressures on the different\r\nbodies. The phase relationships shown in Fig. 3.1.2\r\nmay be changed by variations in Fe, Mg, Ca, and Al\r\nproportions, and changed radically by the addition of\r\nvolatile components (sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3).

  "description" : "This study documents the geology, mineralogy, geochronology and geochemistry of the\r\nSepon Mineral District (SMD) gold and copper deposits. The SMD is located in the Sepon Basin\r\nalong the Truong Son Fold Belt on the NE margins of the Indochina Terrane in south-eastern Laos.\r\nThe geology of the SMD is dominated by Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian-aged continental\r\nfluvial and shallow to deep marine sedimentary rocks that were deposited in a half graben basin.\r\nIntrusion of rhyodacite porphyry (RDP) mainly occurred along pre-existing faults during the Early\r\nPermian, constrained by U-Pb dating of zircons to between 2806 and 2977 Ma.\r\nThree main hypogene mineralisation styles are recognised in the SMD, comprising distal\r\nsedimentary-rock hosted gold (SHGD), proximal skarn (Cu+Au) and central porphyry (Cu-Mo).\r\nExploration programs in the SMD conducted by CRA/RioTinto (1993-1999), Oxiana Limited/OZ\r\nMinerals Limited (2000-2008) resulted in the discovery of a mineral district containing resources of\r\n83 Mt @ 1.8 g/t Au for 4.75 million ounces of gold in seven separate but adjacent SHGD, and\r\nsupergene copper at three deposits, namely the Khanong (27 Mt @ 4.3 % Cu), Thengkham North\r\n(11.4 Mt @ 2.7 % Cu) and Thengkham South (9.8 Mt @ 2.3 % Cu) deposits.\r\nGold in the SMD is predominantly hosted by Devonian Discovery Formation calcareous\r\nshale with lesser amounts reported in turn for the underlying Devonian Nalou Formation bioclastic\r\ndolomite, the Silurian-Devonian Kengkeuk Formation calcareous shale and the Ordovician-Silurian\r\nNampa Formation claystone and siltstone sequence. The Nalou Formation bioclastic dolomite and\r\nthe Kengkeuk Formation calcareous shale mainly host the known SMD copper deposits.\r\nHypogene gold and copper ore-types occurring in the SMD deposits are epigenetic and\r\noften occur along steep faults and/or veins cutting all of the Ordovician to Middle Devonian aged\r\ncarbonate and siliciclastic rocks and Early Permian RDP dykes and sills. The principal structural\r\ntrends controlling and hosting gold mineralisation in the SMD SHGD comprise WNW-striking\r\nnormal faults with steep dips and high-angle ENE-striking normal and reverse faults, cutting all of\r\nthe Ordovician to Devonian-aged carbonate and siliciclastic rocks and Early Permian RDP dykes\r\nand sills. Gold ore zone geometries in the SMD include (1) ribbon-like bodies that are strike\r\ncontinuous, moderate to shallow dipping sheets that are not always connected to faults, and fault\r\ncontrolled steep sheet-like bodies.\r\nCommon major sulphide minerals in the SMD gold and copper deposits include, pyrite,\r\narsenic-rich pyrite, chalcopyrite, and minor sphalerite, galena, bornite and stibnite, but no realgar,\r\norpiment or cinnabar have been observed. Alteration types occurring in the SMD gold deposits\r\ninclude (a) variable decarbonatisation of carbonate units, (b) silicification (jasperoid formation)\r\nalong permeable horizons and faults, (c) locally developed argillisation along RDP contacts, and (d)\r\nvariable dolomitsation of carbonate units. Primary sulphide zones hosting copper mineralisation in\r\nskarns proximal to RDP intrusions are associated with sericite alteration along intrusion margins, in\r\naddition to (a) early prograde garnet and pyroxene skarn alteration cut by later retrograde chloriteepidote\r\nalteration of carbonate host units, and (b) hornfels in non-calcareous sedimentary rocks. At least 5 main paragenetic mineral assemblage stages were observed across the SMD; they\r\nare collectively grouped together as SMD Stages 1 to 5 based on the gold stage paragenetic\r\nobservations from this study: (a) the adjacent to distal type SHGD, (b) the proximal Cu (-Au) skarn\r\ndeposits underlying supergene copper, and (c) the porphyry Cu (-Mo) deposits. The pre-main gold\r\nore stages include SMD Stages 1, 2 and 3A. Main gold ore comprises SMD Stages 3B, 3C, 4A and\r\n4B, and SMD Stage 5 is post-main gold deposition.\r\nThe SMD Stage 1 assemblage is interpreted to form early in the diagenesis of the Sepon\r\nBasin (i.e. syn- to post-sedimentation); it does not contain any known gold and mainly comprises\r\nrare disseminations of framboidal pyrite (Pyrite 1) hosted by calcareous shale (CSH) rocks, with\r\nminor ferroan dolomite occurring along cleavage and stylolites in the CSH rocks, which are in turn\r\ncut by small late stage milky white calcite veins.\r\nThe SMD Stage 2 consists of three types of gold-poor diagenetic pyrite, comprising:\r\n(a) semi-massive nodular-shaped pyrite (Pyrite 2A); (b) euhedral spongy-textured pyrite (Pyrite\r\n2B), and (c) euhedral angular pyrite (Pyrite 2C). These pyrite types contain very low levels of gold,\r\ngenerally <0.3 ppm Au in the cores and <0.1 ppm in the rims. Characteristic pink calcite (Calcite 2)\r\nfilled fractures cutting SMD Stage 2 pyrite and also cuts both cleavages and stylolites containing\r\nStage 1 ferroan dolomite. The SMD Stage 2 is interpreted to form post-sedimentation and late in the\r\ndiagenesis of the Sepon Basin.\r\nThe SMD Stage 3 represents the combined main base metal dominant group of\r\nassemblages in the SMD and consists of three sub-stages, namely: (a) the SMD Stage 3A: early\r\ncarbonate-hosted pyrite-galena-sphalerite-dolomite veins (i.e. in the SMD SHGD), followed by (b)\r\nthe SMD Stage 3B: low grade gold-bearing RDP intrusion-hosted early retrograde veins with\r\npyrite-sphalerite-galena-quartz-dolomite (SMD SHGD and Cu skarn deposits), and (c) the SMD\r\nStage 3C: late low grade gold-bearing RDP intrusion-hosted retrograde veins with quartzchalcopyrite+\r\nbornite+molybdenite (SMD Cu skarn and porphyry Cu-Mo deposits). The SMD Stage\r\n3B mineral assemblage contains low grades of gold ranging from 0.13 to <3 ppm Au that mainly\r\noccur in veins containing pyrite and sphalerite, which were observed in all three deposit types,\r\nnamely: (a) central porphyry (in Pyrite 3B), (b) proximal skarn (in Pyrite SKN1 and sphalerite), and\r\n(c) distal SHGD (in Pyrite 3B1 and sphalerite). SMD Stage 3C typically comprises chalcopyrite\r\nwith inclusions containing low grade gold ranging from 0.06 to 0.9 ppm Au in the central porphyry\r\nand proximal skarn settings.\r\nThe SMD Stage 4 is the main high grade gold phase in the SMD. At least two sub-stages\r\nhave been observed, namely: (a) the SMD Stage 4A pyrite comprising high grades of gold\r\nconcentrated along (i) the growth rims of pyrite cores that also occur along fractures cutting SMD\r\nStage 3 sulphides in the SMD SHGD, or (ii) associated with rough-textured pyrite cutting SKN\r\nStage 3C assemblages in the SMD copper deposits, and (b) the SMD Stage 4B Hg-Au telluride\r\nfilling fractures in the SMD Stage 3 and SMD Stage 4A sulphides. Both the SMD Stage 4A pyrite\r\ntypes observed in the SMD SHGD and the SMD proximal copper skarn deposits contained gold\r\nvalues ranging from >1 and up to 293 ppm Au.\r\nThe post-main high grade gold stage assemblages are grouped into SMD Stage 5 and\r\ncomprises at least three vein assemblages, namely: (a) the SMD Stage 5A: quartz-stibnite-dolomite,\r\n(b) the SMD Stage 5B: quartz-dolomite, and (c) the SMD Stage 5C: calcite-quartz-fluorite calcitequartz.\r\nNo gold grades were observed in the SMD Stage 5 sulphides. The timing of the Cu-Mo mineralisation at SMD is constrained by Re-Os dating of Stage\r\n3C molybdenite which is coeval with Stage 3C chalcopyrite to be between 2871 and 2801 Ma at\r\nthe Thengkham South deposit and at Padan Prospect. The absolute timing of the SMD gold\r\nmineralization is not well constrained but the distal nature of the SMD Stage 4A main gold ore to\r\nPyrite SKN1 suggest that the age of the SMD gold mineralization is broadly similar or slightly\r\nyounger than the SMD skarn (Cu+Au) formation.\r\nDetailed textural, paragenetic and LA-ICPMS trace element investigations of sulphides\r\nindicate that within the SMD SHGD, primary gold is not visible, but is associated with pyrite and\r\noccurs in: (1) SMD Stage 2B Pyrite 2B (diagenetic), which contains <0.5 ppm Au in pyrite cores,\r\n(2) SMD Stage 3B Pyrite 3B (in base metal veins), which contains <0.3 to 3 ppm Au as inclusions,\r\n(3) SMD Stage 4A Pyrite 4A, which contains >3 to 200 ppm Au as overgrowths on As-rich rims,\r\nand (4) SMD Stage 4B sulphosalts (in veins), which contain Hg-Au-telluride. The later high grades\r\nof gold in Pyrite 4A could have been derived from the early SMD Stage 2 diagenetic pyrites in the\r\nSMD and/or from the later SMD Stages 3B and 3C pyrite types during syn- to post-emplacement of\r\nthe SMD RDP intrusions.\r\nGold in the SMD copper deposits is not visible, it is within pyrite and occurs in: (1) SMD\r\nStage 3B Pyrite SKN1 (in retrograde veins), which contains <0.7 ppm Au as inclusions, (2) SMD\r\nStage 3C Chalcopyrite 3C (in retrograde veins), which contains <0.9 ppm Au as inclusions, and\r\n(3) SMD Stage 4A Pyrite SKN2 (fractures), which contains >1 to 293 ppm Au in As-rich pyrite.\r\nGold deposited in the SMD Stage 3B and 3C pyrites syn- to post-emplacement of the SMD RDP\r\nintrusions provides potential gold sources for the high grade gold formed in Pyrite SKN2.\r\nBoth the LA-ICPMS and PIXE NMP analytical methods established that the pyrite types in\r\nthe distal SMD SHGD comprise the following trace element signatures: (a) SMD Stage 2B Pyrite\r\n2B (pre-main gold ore): Pb-Ni-Co-As-Ti, (b) SMD Stage 3A Pyrite 3A (pre-main gold ore): As-Cu-\r\nNi-Pb, and (c) SMD Stage 4A Pyrite 4A1 to 4A4 (main gold ore): Au-As-Sb-Pb-Cu-Ni-Ti-Zn-Mn-\r\nAg-Tl. In contrast, pyrite types from the proximal skarn mineral assemblages in the SMD copper\r\ndeposits contain the following trace element signatures: (a) SMD Stage 3B Pyrite SKN1 (pre-main\r\ngold ore): Cu-Zn-Co-Se-Ni-Bi-Mn-TeAu, (b) SMD Stage 3C Chalcopyrite 3C (pre-main gold\r\nore): Cu-Zn-Se-Bi+Au, and (c) SMD Stage 4A Pyrite SKN2 (main gold ore): Au-Cu-As-Bi-Co-Se-\r\nPb-Zn-Ag. The presence of Cu-Zn-Se-Bi in primary copper ore stage Chalcopyrite 3C (SMD Stage\r\n3C) probably implies derivation from magmatic sources during RDP intrusion emplacement.\r\nThe SMD Stage 2B diagenetic pyrite yielded a wide range of 34S values from -11.6 to\r\n+33‰ and these results are comparable to the known ranges of 34S values for sedimentary pyrite\r\ntypes in other Carlin-type SHGD in Nevada, USA and China. In contrast, the SMD Stage 3 group\r\nbase metal sulphides have 34S compositions that are more similar to those derived from deep\r\nmagmatic or metamorphic sources centred at 05‰. Furthermore, the light 34S values for SMD\r\nStage 4A pyrite (Pyrite 4A) ranging from -28.9 to 2.5‰ are comparable to 34S values reported for\r\n(a) late gold ore stage pyrite in the Nevada Carlin-type gold depositsand (b) main gold ore stage\r\npyrite in the Chinese Carlin-type SHGD. However, the post-main gold ore SMD Stage 5 stibnite has\r\n34S values more similar to magmatic systems.\r\nFluid inclusion studies combined with textural cathodoluminescence investigation\r\nindicate that main primary copper ore stage quartz (SMD Stage 3C) yielded minimum homogenisation temperatures ranging from 175 to 260oC. The presence of primary hematite\r\nwith this mineral assemblage suggests oxidising fluid conditions during mineralisation, thereby\r\npossibly enabling copper to be transported at these lower temperatures. The quartz from the\r\nmain primary copper ore (SMD Stage 3C) yielded moderate salinity values ranging from 7.7 to\r\n11.2 wt % NaCl equiv. Bi-variate plots of the SMD 18O and D compositions from the SMD\r\nStages 3B and 3C pre-main gold ore assemblages have ore fluid characteristics similar to\r\nmetamorphic and magmatic waters. Overall, the SMD Stage 3C ore fluids in quartz associated\r\nwith Chalcopyrite 3C are probably derived from magmatic sources considering (a) their close\r\nrelationship with the SMD RDP intrusions, (b) their isothermal mixing characteristics, and\r\n(c) the presence of CO2.\r\nThe main gold ore SMD Stage 4A quartz yielded homogenisation temperature (Th)\r\nvalues ranging from 180 to 290oC; these results are similar to Th values in the distal\r\ndisseminated gold deposit (DDGD) types, but are hotter than those in typical Nevada Carlintype\r\ndeposits. Salinity values from the main gold ore SMD Stage 4A quartz yielded two groups\r\nat 4.3 to 8.6 wt % NaCl equiv. and 12.1 to 13.7 wt % NaCl equiv., indicating the possible\r\npresence of two fluids. Additionally, the SMD Stage 4A main-gold ore fluids in quartz yielded\r\ncalculated 18O values ranging from 9.3 to 13.8 ‰, which are in the range for metamorphic and\r\nmagmatic waters. Furthermore, surface fluid dilution trends confirmed the presence of at least\r\ntwo saline fluids present in fluid inclusions from the SMD Stage 4A quartz associated with main\r\ngold stage Pyrite 4A, indicating the involvement of ore fluids that are similar to (1) evolved\r\nmeteoric fluids for those with low-moderate salinities <9 wt % NaCl equiv., and (2) magmatic\r\nfluids comprising moderate-high salinities >9 wt % NaCl equiv., although involvement of\r\namagmatic (i.e. metamorphic) fluids and/or connate brines cannot be ruled out.\r\nAll of the RDP, galena and pyrite Pb isotope results from the SMD imply a crustal Pb\r\nsource. The pre-main gold ore-stage mineralisation shows evidence for at least two distinct Pb\r\nisotope sources, comprising (a) less radiogenic Pb in SMD Stage 3A galena associated with a\r\nparagenetically early carbonate-hosted style of base metal mineralisation mainly hosted by\r\nDevonian Nalou Formation bioclastic dolomite, and (b) paragenetically later but also more\r\nradiogenic Pb occurring in SMD Stage 3B galena and SMD RDP samples that are hosted by\r\nyounger Early Permian RDP intrusions. However, The main gold ore-stage Pyrites 4A (SMD Stage\r\n4A) contain a wide range of Pb isotopic sources that are interpreted to be derived from both (a)\r\nearly less radiogenic sedimentary Pb sources and (b) later more radiogenic Pb from RDP intrusions.\r\nThe overall geological setting, mineral assemblages and geochemistry of the SMD SHGD\r\nshare several broad characteristics with those in the Nevada (USA) and Dian-Qian-Gui (Southern\r\nChina) Carlin-type gold deposits and also some with the Nevada DDGD-types. In conclusion,\r\ngeochemical data from the SMD gold and copper deposits suggests a genetic model involving fluid\r\nmixing processes, comprising (1) early magmatic and minor associated metamorphic fluids, mainly\r\ncontributing Cu, Au, Pb and S during the formation of the SMD copper skarn and porphyry deposits\r\n(SMD Stage 3C), and (2) later interaction of the early deep magmatic and minor associated\r\nmetamorphic fluids with circulating evolved meteoric fluids, possibly also sourcing S, Pb, Au and\r\nassociated trace elements from sedimentary rocks for the gold deposits (SMD Stage 4A).",
  "texts" : [ "Geological setting, geochemistry and genesis of\r\nthe Sepon gold and copper deposits, Laos", "This study documents the geology, mineralogy, geochronology and geochemistry of the\r\nSepon Mineral District (SMD) gold and copper deposits. The SMD is located in the Sepon Basin\r\nalong the Truong Son Fold Belt on the NE margins of the Indochina Terrane in south-eastern Laos.\r\nThe geology of the SMD is dominated by Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian-aged continental\r\nfluvial and shallow to deep marine sedimentary rocks that were deposited in a half graben basin.\r\nIntrusion of rhyodacite porphyry (RDP) mainly occurred along pre-existing faults during the Early\r\nPermian, constrained by U-Pb dating of zircons to between 2806 and 2977 Ma.\r\nThree main hypogene mineralisation styles are recognised in the SMD, comprising distal\r\nsedimentary-rock hosted gold (SHGD), proximal skarn (Cu+Au) and central porphyry (Cu-Mo).\r\nExploration programs in the SMD conducted by CRA/RioTinto (1993-1999), Oxiana Limited/OZ\r\nMinerals Limited (2000-2008) resulted in the discovery of a mineral district containing resources of\r\n83 Mt @ 1.8 g/t Au for 4.75 million ounces of gold in seven separate but adjacent SHGD, and\r\nsupergene copper at three deposits, namely the Khanong (27 Mt @ 4.3 % Cu), Thengkham North\r\n(11.4 Mt @ 2.7 % Cu) and Thengkham South (9.8 Mt @ 2.3 % Cu) deposits.\r\nGold in the SMD is predominantly hosted by Devonian Discovery Formation calcareous\r\nshale with lesser amounts reported in turn for the underlying Devonian Nalou Formation bioclastic\r\ndolomite, the Silurian-Devonian Kengkeuk Formation calcareous shale and the Ordovician-Silurian\r\nNampa Formation claystone and siltstone sequence. The Nalou Formation bioclastic dolomite and\r\nthe Kengkeuk Formation calcareous shale mainly host the known SMD copper deposits.\r\nHypogene gold and copper ore-types occurring in the SMD deposits are epigenetic and\r\noften occur along steep faults and/or veins cutting all of the Ordovician to Middle Devonian aged\r\ncarbonate and siliciclastic rocks and Early Permian RDP dykes and sills. The principal structural\r\ntrends controlling and hosting gold mineralisation in the SMD SHGD comprise WNW-striking\r\nnormal faults with steep dips and high-angle ENE-striking normal and reverse faults, cutting all of\r\nthe Ordovician to Devonian-aged carbonate and siliciclastic rocks and Early Permian RDP dykes\r\nand sills. Gold ore zone geometries in the SMD include (1) ribbon-like bodies that are strike\r\ncontinuous, moderate to shallow dipping sheets that are not always connected to faults, and fault\r\ncontrolled steep sheet-like bodies.\r\nCommon major sulphide minerals in the SMD gold and copper deposits include, pyrite,\r\narsenic-rich pyrite, chalcopyrite, and minor sphalerite, galena, bornite and stibnite, but no realgar,\r\norpiment or cinnabar have been observed. Alteration types occurring in the SMD gold deposits\r\ninclude (a) variable decarbonatisation of carbonate units, (b) silicification (jasperoid formation)\r\nalong permeable horizons and faults, (c) locally developed argillisation along RDP contacts, and (d)\r\nvariable dolomitsation of carbonate units. Primary sulphide zones hosting copper mineralisation in\r\nskarns proximal to RDP intrusions are associated with sericite alteration along intrusion margins, in\r\naddition to (a) early prograde garnet and pyroxene skarn alteration cut by later retrograde chloriteepidote\r\nalteration of carbonate host units, and (b) hornfels in non-calcareous sedimentary rocks. At least 5 main paragenetic mineral assemblage stages were observed across the SMD; they\r\nare collectively grouped together as SMD Stages 1 to 5 based on the gold stage paragenetic\r\nobservations from this study: (a) the adjacent to distal type SHGD, (b) the proximal Cu (-Au) skarn\r\ndeposits underlying supergene copper, and (c) the porphyry Cu (-Mo) deposits. The pre-main gold\r\nore stages include SMD Stages 1, 2 and 3A. Main gold ore comprises SMD Stages 3B, 3C, 4A and\r\n4B, and SMD Stage 5 is post-main gold deposition.\r\nThe SMD Stage 1 assemblage is interpreted to form early in the diagenesis of the Sepon\r\nBasin (i.e. syn- to post-sedimentation); it does not contain any known gold and mainly comprises\r\nrare disseminations of framboidal pyrite (Pyrite 1) hosted by calcareous shale (CSH) rocks, with\r\nminor ferroan dolomite occurring along cleavage and stylolites in the CSH rocks, which are in turn\r\ncut by small late stage milky white calcite veins.\r\nThe SMD Stage 2 consists of three types of gold-poor diagenetic pyrite, comprising:\r\n(a) semi-massive nodular-shaped pyrite (Pyrite 2A); (b) euhedral spongy-textured pyrite (Pyrite\r\n2B), and (c) euhedral angular pyrite (Pyrite 2C). These pyrite types contain very low levels of gold,\r\ngenerally <0.3 ppm Au in the cores and <0.1 ppm in the rims. Characteristic pink calcite (Calcite 2)\r\nfilled fractures cutting SMD Stage 2 pyrite and also cuts both cleavages and stylolites containing\r\nStage 1 ferroan dolomite. The SMD Stage 2 is interpreted to form post-sedimentation and late in the\r\ndiagenesis of the Sepon Basin.\r\nThe SMD Stage 3 represents the combined main base metal dominant group of\r\nassemblages in the SMD and consists of three sub-stages, namely: (a) the SMD Stage 3A: early\r\ncarbonate-hosted pyrite-galena-sphalerite-dolomite veins (i.e. in the SMD SHGD), followed by (b)\r\nthe SMD Stage 3B: low grade gold-bearing RDP intrusion-hosted early retrograde veins with\r\npyrite-sphalerite-galena-quartz-dolomite (SMD SHGD and Cu skarn deposits), and (c) the SMD\r\nStage 3C: late low grade gold-bearing RDP intrusion-hosted retrograde veins with quartzchalcopyrite+\r\nbornite+molybdenite (SMD Cu skarn and porphyry Cu-Mo deposits). The SMD Stage\r\n3B mineral assemblage contains low grades of gold ranging from 0.13 to <3 ppm Au that mainly\r\noccur in veins containing pyrite and sphalerite, which were observed in all three deposit types,\r\nnamely: (a) central porphyry (in Pyrite 3B), (b) proximal skarn (in Pyrite SKN1 and sphalerite), and\r\n(c) distal SHGD (in Pyrite 3B1 and sphalerite). SMD Stage 3C typically comprises chalcopyrite\r\nwith inclusions containing low grade gold ranging from 0.06 to 0.9 ppm Au in the central porphyry\r\nand proximal skarn settings.\r\nThe SMD Stage 4 is the main high grade gold phase in the SMD. At least two sub-stages\r\nhave been observed, namely: (a) the SMD Stage 4A pyrite comprising high grades of gold\r\nconcentrated along (i) the growth rims of pyrite cores that also occur along fractures cutting SMD\r\nStage 3 sulphides in the SMD SHGD, or (ii) associated with rough-textured pyrite cutting SKN\r\nStage 3C assemblages in the SMD copper deposits, and (b) the SMD Stage 4B Hg-Au telluride\r\nfilling fractures in the SMD Stage 3 and SMD Stage 4A sulphides. Both the SMD Stage 4A pyrite\r\ntypes observed in the SMD SHGD and the SMD proximal copper skarn deposits contained gold\r\nvalues ranging from >1 and up to 293 ppm Au.\r\nThe post-main high grade gold stage assemblages are grouped into SMD Stage 5 and\r\ncomprises at least three vein assemblages, namely: (a) the SMD Stage 5A: quartz-stibnite-dolomite,\r\n(b) the SMD Stage 5B: quartz-dolomite, and (c) the SMD Stage 5C: calcite-quartz-fluorite calcitequartz.\r\nNo gold grades were observed in the SMD Stage 5 sulphides. The timing of the Cu-Mo mineralisation at SMD is constrained by Re-Os dating of Stage\r\n3C molybdenite which is coeval with Stage 3C chalcopyrite to be between 2871 and 2801 Ma at\r\nthe Thengkham South deposit and at Padan Prospect. The absolute timing of the SMD gold\r\nmineralization is not well constrained but the distal nature of the SMD Stage 4A main gold ore to\r\nPyrite SKN1 suggest that the age of the SMD gold mineralization is broadly similar or slightly\r\nyounger than the SMD skarn (Cu+Au) formation.\r\nDetailed textural, paragenetic and LA-ICPMS trace element investigations of sulphides\r\nindicate that within the SMD SHGD, primary gold is not visible, but is associated with pyrite and\r\noccurs in: (1) SMD Stage 2B Pyrite 2B (diagenetic), which contains <0.5 ppm Au in pyrite cores,\r\n(2) SMD Stage 3B Pyrite 3B (in base metal veins), which contains <0.3 to 3 ppm Au as inclusions,\r\n(3) SMD Stage 4A Pyrite 4A, which contains >3 to 200 ppm Au as overgrowths on As-rich rims,\r\nand (4) SMD Stage 4B sulphosalts (in veins), which contain Hg-Au-telluride. The later high grades\r\nof gold in Pyrite 4A could have been derived from the early SMD Stage 2 diagenetic pyrites in the\r\nSMD and/or from the later SMD Stages 3B and 3C pyrite types during syn- to post-emplacement of\r\nthe SMD RDP intrusions.\r\nGold in the SMD copper deposits is not visible, it is within pyrite and occurs in: (1) SMD\r\nStage 3B Pyrite SKN1 (in retrograde veins), which contains <0.7 ppm Au as inclusions, (2) SMD\r\nStage 3C Chalcopyrite 3C (in retrograde veins), which contains <0.9 ppm Au as inclusions, and\r\n(3) SMD Stage 4A Pyrite SKN2 (fractures), which contains >1 to 293 ppm Au in As-rich pyrite.\r\nGold deposited in the SMD Stage 3B and 3C pyrites syn- to post-emplacement of the SMD RDP\r\nintrusions provides potential gold sources for the high grade gold formed in Pyrite SKN2.\r\nBoth the LA-ICPMS and PIXE NMP analytical methods established that the pyrite types in\r\nthe distal SMD SHGD comprise the following trace element signatures: (a) SMD Stage 2B Pyrite\r\n2B (pre-main gold ore): Pb-Ni-Co-As-Ti, (b) SMD Stage 3A Pyrite 3A (pre-main gold ore): As-Cu-\r\nNi-Pb, and (c) SMD Stage 4A Pyrite 4A1 to 4A4 (main gold ore): Au-As-Sb-Pb-Cu-Ni-Ti-Zn-Mn-\r\nAg-Tl. In contrast, pyrite types from the proximal skarn mineral assemblages in the SMD copper\r\ndeposits contain the following trace element signatures: (a) SMD Stage 3B Pyrite SKN1 (pre-main\r\ngold ore): Cu-Zn-Co-Se-Ni-Bi-Mn-TeAu, (b) SMD Stage 3C Chalcopyrite 3C (pre-main gold\r\nore): Cu-Zn-Se-Bi+Au, and (c) SMD Stage 4A Pyrite SKN2 (main gold ore): Au-Cu-As-Bi-Co-Se-\r\nPb-Zn-Ag. The presence of Cu-Zn-Se-Bi in primary copper ore stage Chalcopyrite 3C (SMD Stage\r\n3C) probably implies derivation from magmatic sources during RDP intrusion emplacement.\r\nThe SMD Stage 2B diagenetic pyrite yielded a wide range of 34S values from -11.6 to\r\n+33‰ and these results are comparable to the known ranges of 34S values for sedimentary pyrite\r\ntypes in other Carlin-type SHGD in Nevada, USA and China. In contrast, the SMD Stage 3 group\r\nbase metal sulphides have 34S compositions that are more similar to those derived from deep\r\nmagmatic or metamorphic sources centred at 05‰. Furthermore, the light 34S values for SMD\r\nStage 4A pyrite (Pyrite 4A) ranging from -28.9 to 2.5‰ are comparable to 34S values reported for\r\n(a) late gold ore stage pyrite in the Nevada Carlin-type gold depositsand (b) main gold ore stage\r\npyrite in the Chinese Carlin-type SHGD. However, the post-main gold ore SMD Stage 5 stibnite has\r\n34S values more similar to magmatic systems.\r\nFluid inclusion studies combined with textural cathodoluminescence investigation\r\nindicate that main primary copper ore stage quartz (SMD Stage 3C) yielded minimum homogenisation temperatures ranging from 175 to 260oC. The presence of primary hematite\r\nwith this mineral assemblage suggests oxidising fluid conditions during mineralisation, thereby\r\npossibly enabling copper to be transported at these lower temperatures. The quartz from the\r\nmain primary copper ore (SMD Stage 3C) yielded moderate salinity values ranging from 7.7 to\r\n11.2 wt % NaCl equiv. Bi-variate plots of the SMD 18O and D compositions from the SMD\r\nStages 3B and 3C pre-main gold ore assemblages have ore fluid characteristics similar to\r\nmetamorphic and magmatic waters. Overall, the SMD Stage 3C ore fluids in quartz associated\r\nwith Chalcopyrite 3C are probably derived from magmatic sources considering (a) their close\r\nrelationship with the SMD RDP intrusions, (b) their isothermal mixing characteristics, and\r\n(c) the presence of CO2.\r\nThe main gold ore SMD Stage 4A quartz yielded homogenisation temperature (Th)\r\nvalues ranging from 180 to 290oC; these results are similar to Th values in the distal\r\ndisseminated gold deposit (DDGD) types, but are hotter than those in typical Nevada Carlintype\r\ndeposits. Salinity values from the main gold ore SMD Stage 4A quartz yielded two groups\r\nat 4.3 to 8.6 wt % NaCl equiv. and 12.1 to 13.7 wt % NaCl equiv., indicating the possible\r\npresence of two fluids. Additionally, the SMD Stage 4A main-gold ore fluids in quartz yielded\r\ncalculated 18O values ranging from 9.3 to 13.8 ‰, which are in the range for metamorphic and\r\nmagmatic waters. Furthermore, surface fluid dilution trends confirmed the presence of at least\r\ntwo saline fluids present in fluid inclusions from the SMD Stage 4A quartz associated with main\r\ngold stage Pyrite 4A, indicating the involvement of ore fluids that are similar to (1) evolved\r\nmeteoric fluids for those with low-moderate salinities <9 wt % NaCl equiv., and (2) magmatic\r\nfluids comprising moderate-high salinities >9 wt % NaCl equiv., although involvement of\r\namagmatic (i.e. metamorphic) fluids and/or connate brines cannot be ruled out.\r\nAll of the RDP, galena and pyrite Pb isotope results from the SMD imply a crustal Pb\r\nsource. The pre-main gold ore-stage mineralisation shows evidence for at least two distinct Pb\r\nisotope sources, comprising (a) less radiogenic Pb in SMD Stage 3A galena associated with a\r\nparagenetically early carbonate-hosted style of base metal mineralisation mainly hosted by\r\nDevonian Nalou Formation bioclastic dolomite, and (b) paragenetically later but also more\r\nradiogenic Pb occurring in SMD Stage 3B galena and SMD RDP samples that are hosted by\r\nyounger Early Permian RDP intrusions. However, The main gold ore-stage Pyrites 4A (SMD Stage\r\n4A) contain a wide range of Pb isotopic sources that are interpreted to be derived from both (a)\r\nearly less radiogenic sedimentary Pb sources and (b) later more radiogenic Pb from RDP intrusions.\r\nThe overall geological setting, mineral assemblages and geochemistry of the SMD SHGD\r\nshare several broad characteristics with those in the Nevada (USA) and Dian-Qian-Gui (Southern\r\nChina) Carlin-type gold deposits and also some with the Nevada DDGD-types. In conclusion,\r\ngeochemical data from the SMD gold and copper deposits suggests a genetic model involving fluid\r\nmixing processes, comprising (1) early magmatic and minor associated metamorphic fluids, mainly\r\ncontributing Cu, Au, Pb and S during the formation of the SMD copper skarn and porphyry deposits\r\n(SMD Stage 3C), and (2) later interaction of the early deep magmatic and minor associated\r\nmetamorphic fluids with circulating evolved meteoric fluids, possibly also sourcing S, Pb, Au and\r\nassociated trace elements from sedimentary rocks for the gold deposits (SMD Stage 4A).", null ],

  "title" : "GEOCHEMICAL AND ISOTOPIC CONSTRAINTS ON HIMU MAGMATISM: EVIDENCE FROM MOUNT CAMEROON AND MOUNT ETINDE (CAMEROON, WEST AFRICA)",
  "description" : "Mount Cameroon and Mount Etinde volcanoes are located at the passive continental margin of the West African coast. They are interpreted to represent the transition of volcanism from the oceanic to the continental part of the 1600 km volcanic province known as the Cameroon Volcanic Line (CVL). This study is aimed at constraining the source of the HIMU or µ (where µ = 238U/204Pb) feature in these volcanoes and in evaluating their geochemical and isotopic evolution from prehistoric activities to recent. Mount Cameroon and Mount Etinde volcanoes have been chosen for investigation because unlike the classical HIMU volcanoes, which are located on oceanic crust, these volcanoes cut the Sub-Continental Lithospheric Mantle (SCLM) but still possess the chemical and isotopic signatures that characterize HIMU lavas. It is geodynamically significant that none of the other volcanoes that define the continental part of the (CVL) appears to be HIMU in character. Mount Cameroon and Etinde thus, provide a natural laboratory in which to assess the transition from none-HIMU magmatism on continental crust, to HIMU magmatism on oceanic crust, with the potentials of contributing to the understanding of HIMU magmatism in the entire CVL belt. To arrive at this objective, samples collected from both the modern (1959, 1982, 1999 and 2000) and prehistoric flows of Mount Cameroon, including samples obtained from the flanks of Mount Etinde are being investigated. In this regard, mineral chemistry, major/trace element, including 208Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, 206Pb/204Pb, 87Sr/86Sr and 143Nd/144Nd isotopic data for these samples are being reported. Major element chemistry shows that Mount Cameroon lavas are nepheline-normative with MgO contents ranging from 4-9 wt% and SiO2 from 43-48 wt%, which classify as silica undersaturated, mafic alkaline tephri-basanites. Chondrite normalized Rare Earth Element (REE) arrays show extremely tight abundance ranges with no possibility of distinguishing between the different eruptive episodes. They exhibit enrichment in the light REE (LREE). The absence of Eu anomalies indicates the minimal role of plagioclase fractionation in the evolution of the lavas. Compatible trace elements versus MgO relationships show trends which indicate evolution through the fractional crystallization of olivine, clinopyroxene and Cr-spinel. With the exception of a few Mount Cameroon lavas, which show more primitive compositions (for example Ni &gt; 145 ppm, Cr &gt; 400 ppm and Mg# &gt; 57) suggesting possible equilibrium with lower mantle mineralogy, the remaining lavas show significant degrees of fractionation, shown by Mg# ranging between 45 and 51, Ni=29-87ppm and Cr=28-144 ppm, indicative of lower pressure fractional crystallization. Olivine compositions in Mount Cameroon lavas vary from Fo59-87 with predominant composition between Fo78-87. For Mount Etinde volcano, the majority of samples have Ni = 4-95 ppm and Cr = 0.4-257 ppm and only few samples show trends of typical primitive mantle liquids; Ni = 120-140 ppm and Cr = 258-381 ppm. Olivine compositions range from Fo65-87. However, a presumed parental sample in Etinde has Fo66-87. Canonical trace element ratios ratios for both volcanoes e.g. Nb/U (46-48), Nb/Th (12-14) and chondritic Nb/Ta values (16.9-17.6), rule out the possibility of significant melt/crust interactions. Although the modern and prehistoric flows of Mount Cameroon are geochemically variable, they are isotopically homogeneous, indicative of a common mantle source, which has remained unchanged for &gt; 10 Ma. Geochemical differences in these lavas must therefore represent the effects of variable degrees of partial melting and crystal fractionation. By contrast, isotopic variations and trace element systematics suggest a relatively heterogeneous mantle source and or high degree of fractionation for Etinde lavas leading to the occurrence of basalts and differentiated nephelintes. Pb-Sr-Nd isotope compositions show the following ranges for Mount Cameroon lavas: 206Pb/204Pb=20.19-20.46, 207Pb/204Pb=15.63-15.69, 208Pb/204Pb=40.02-40.30, 87Sr/86Sr=0.70322-0.70335 (-21.37 to -19.47) and 143Nd/144Nd=0.51276-0.51284 (PNd = +2 to +4). Mount Etinde lavas are characterised by 206Pb/204Pb=20.16-20.55, 207Pb/204Pb=15.64-15.68, 208Pb/204Pb=40.04-40.32, 87Sr/86Sr=0.70324-0.70348 (PSr = - 21.04 to -17.63) and 143Nd/144Nd=0.51273-0.5129 (PNd = +1.77 to +5.19). The results show that Etinde lavas not only cover the entire range of Mount Cameroon isotopic compositions but extends towards more radiogenic Pb and Nd compositions (PNd = +1.77 to +5.19). The wide range in PNd in Etinde melts reflects the influence of a heterogeneous source with variation in Sm/Nd or that the lavas entrained DMM (asthenospheric) signature during ascent. The restricted range of PNd in Mt Cameroon lavas suggests that the mantle source is OIB-like, possibly the lower mantle and that these lavas ascended without significant entrainment of DMM material. The overall isotopic compositions indicate that lavas from both volcanoes are derived from the mantle reservoir known as HIMU, suggestive of high time-integrated Pb enrichment resulting from U+Th/Pb fractionation. The HIMU signature for both Mount Cameroon and Etinde has previously been attributed to the influence of the St. Helena plume. The results of this study however suggest that although St. Helena is also HIMU in character, it is geochemically distinct from the Cameroon Line volcanoes. A new model is therefore proposed suggesting that the HIMU feature in both Mounts Cameroon and Etinde lavas is supplied by lower mantle upwellings that have been seismically imaged beneath the Atlantic, extending through the Mount Cameroon region to the East African Rift System.",

Several studies have investigated the fabrication of nanocomposites based on carbon nanotubes and analysed properties, but there is still insufficient data on their structure-property relationships. This thesis has investigated the central importance of stress transfer Raman studies in epoxy composites reinforced with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) and multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to elucidate the reinforcing ability of the CNTs in an epoxy matrix. This project was undertaken to synthesise and characterize MWCNTs and determine the effect of different weight fractions of untreated MWCNTs on the stress transfer efficiency at the MWCNTS / epoxy interface and on the stiffness of the thermomechanical properties of the MWCNTS / epoxy composites. It was undertaken to assess the stress transfer efficiency at the CNT / epoxy interface and at the inter-walls of the CNTs with tensile deformation and with cyclic loading.Optimized conditions of the injection chemical vapour deposition method (CVD), such as long injection times were applied to produce MWCNTs with a high yield, high aspect ratio and well-defined G' Raman peak. The morphology and size of CNTs were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) while their thermal stability was examined by Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Both Raman spectroscopy and mechanical testing (static and dynamic) were utilized in this study. The Raman spectroscopy research consisted of following the G'-band frequency and linewidth as well as the intensity of radial breathing modes (RBMs) during tensile deformation. The stress-induced Raman shifts in the nanocomposites have been shown to be controlled by the number of carbon nanolayers.

Tensile tests and dynamic mechanical testing were used to assess the mechanical properties of the nanocomposites.The most obvious finding to be drawn from the present study is that the reinforcement of the epoxy resin with different loadings of MWCNTs is useful, but the best reinforcement was at low loadings of MWCNTs. One of the more significant findings to emerge from this study is that (k_i) between the inner walls of the DWCNTs and MWCNTs are quite similar (~0.7), which suggest that (k_i)  may be similar for all CVD MWCNTs and DWCNTs.

  "description" : "On Mass Problem in Relativistic Mechanics and Gravitational Physics Anatoli Vankov (dated 12.16.2003, e-mail: anatolivankov@hotmail.com) The proper mass of a test particle in General Relativity Theory (GRT) is a rest mass, so it is considered principally constant, just as in Kinematics of Special Relativity Theory (SRT). One may think that the same is true in SRT Mechanics (Dynamics). We found that a proper mass change occurs under a force action that is, during a transition from one inertial reference frame to another. The proper mass constancy in SRT Mechanics is, in fact, a weak field approximation leading to the Newtonian limit. We show that a variability of the proper mass is a fundamental physical phenomenon. It becomes especially important under strong field conditions, therefore, for understanding of the so-called self-energy divergence. The problem was seemingly overcome with help of the known renormalization procedure in Electrodynamics but not in gravitational field theory. GRT was shown to be nonrenormalizable. Our analysis of the SRT mass-energy concept showed that, after the proper mass variation was taken into account in SRT Mechanics equations, arguments for an exclusion of the gravity phenomenon from the SRT domain fell away. Moreover, this approach resulted in principal elimination of the gravitational divergence problem. Another new result concerned the speed of light. The conclusion was that the speed of light is not a fundamental physical constant: it is a physical quantity determined by a gravitational potential and has a cosmological meaning. In spite of radically different physical interpretation, the alternative approach to the gravitational problem gives an adequate description of  weak-field  gravitational experiments as GRT does: a numerical difference from GRT predictions is not meaningful. However, the difference in predictions progressively rises with field strength and an energy increase.

  "title" : "20.On the Volcanism of the Huzi Volcanic Zone, with Special Reference to the Geology and Petrology of Idu and the Southern Islands.",
  "description" : "When volcanic activity began in the region studied is a matter of conjecture. There is no doubt, however, that volcanoes were already in existence in Eocene times, seeing that the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands are composed almost exclusively of andesitic rocks, both explosive and effusive, with a few intercalated Eocene limestones. If these islands were located on the submarine ridge that underlies the insular volcanoes of the Huzi volcanic zone, it would be more than likely that the Ogasawara volcanics are products of the earliest recognized forerunner of volcanic activity in that zone, but their more or less outlying position seem to militate against this view. However, notwithstanding the lack of positive evidence indicating structural similarity, the writer presents the above view as a possible explanation, because the Ogasawara andesites show the same general characteristics, both microscopical and chemical, as the allied rocks from the Huzi volcanic zone. The first indisputable record of volcanic activity in the Huzi volcanic zone dates to early Miocene. This seems to be the case not only with the Idu region, in the study of which the writer is chiefly concerned, but also with the much larger region of the \"fossa magna\", of which Idu forms but a small part. Through the whole of the period that succeeded it, the same general sequence of volcanic activity has beeu maintained in most parts of the fossa magna with certain local differences. It is therefore highly probable that, although local volcanic activity had already manifested itself in Eocene times in the Ogasawara Islands, more active and more regional activity had started contemporaneously with the tectonic disturbances, the result of all which is the fossa magna, which severed the geologic continuation between southwestern and northeastern Japan. As to whether or not the Ogasawara Islands were subjected to the same disturbances, the writer is unable to say. The lower Miocene volcanism in Idu, which occurred beneath the sea of that time, is represented by a thick series of highly altered volcanics (lavas and pyroclastics), referred to as the Yugasima beds (or the propylite series). This series consists for the most part of basaltic and andesitic rocks, although dacites and liparites are also represented, especially in the upper horizons of the series. The succession of these rocks implies considerable time, during which certain structural deformations might possibly have recurred, resulting in several periods of volcanic accumulation. But its actual duration is a question we have no means of answering at present, the only precise datum being the faunal evidence (Lepidocyclina limestone from Simo-Siroiwra and Miogypsina limestone from Nasimoto), which assigns certain dacitic volcanics lying some distance above the base of the series to lower Miocene. The propylite series is invaded by numerous minor intrusives (dikes, sheets, and necks) of various rock-types―diabase, porphyrite, basalt, andesite, dacite, and liparite (quartz-porphyry). Although these intrusives are evidently later than the propylite series, not all of them were formed contemporaneously. The basic intrusives (including diabase, porphyrite, basalt, and andesite) are mostly older, all being altered in the same way as the propylite series in which they are found, whereas the more acid intrusives are mostly somewhat younger, being probably correlated with the acid volcanics that overlie unconformably the propylite series. The lower Miocene volcanism was followed, probably during upper Miocene, by submarine eruptions of liparites and dacites, with subordinate andesites, all of'which are distributed mostly in south Idu and rather locally in north Idu. As just mentioned, some of the minor intrusives in the propylite series, especially those of acid rocks, might be the feeders of the upper Miocene volcanics. In contrast with the propylite series, these upper Miocene volcanics are either quite fresh or are but little altered. The foregoing phase of volcanism was succeeded, most probably during lower Pliocene, by a subordinate phase of activity characterized by minor intrusions (dikes) and extrusions of andesites. Regarding volcanism during this period, however, we are largely in the dark as only a few rocks in Idu have been identified with that period. In the uppermost Pliocene, eruptions of basalts, dacites, and andesites, occurred only locally in Idu, and these were again exclusively submarine. At the  close  of the Tertiary or the beginning of the Pleistocene, Idu peninsula was subjected like the other regions in the fossa magma to crustal movement, generally in the sense of uplift, and it was not until some time after this movement, which raised so much of the Tertiary sea-floor into land, that Pleistocene volcanism became vigorous. This volcanism was concentrated mainly in the northern part of the peninsula, while in the southern part, Tertiary volcanism was succeeded by that relative quiescence which marked the Pleistocene aud Recent epochs. The first phase of lower Pleistocene volcanism is thus represented by eruptions of basalts, andesites, and dacites, all occurring in the forms of tuff and tuff-breccia that now occupy the bulk of the lacustrine deposits (Ono beds, Simo-Hata beds, and Simo-Tanna beds) accumulated during that period on the erosion reliefs of the Tertiary formations. It was followed at the end of lower Pleistocene and in the upper Pleistocene, when the lower Pleistocene deposits had been more or less deformed, by eruptions of central volcanoes. The volcanoes Tensi, Usami, Taga, Yugawara, Asitaka, Amagi, Hakone, and others in the northwestern part of the Idu peninsula yet unstudied, as also the dacitic masses in the vicinity of Atami, are ^ all products of this phase of activity, with however certain differences in the times when the activities began and in the period for which they lasted. The basaltic- Omuro-yama group represents the last volcanism in the peninsula, which probably occurred some time later when the older volcanoes Tensi, Usami, Taga, etc., were subjected to more or less dislocation and dissection ; while the numerous hot-springs there represent a stage of post-volcanic thermal activity. So far as its visible part is concerned, Huzi may date from a much later age, probably Recent. That one of the earliest lava-flows from the volcano is younger than the older somma of Hakone has been definitely proved by field evidence. All the insular volcanoes of the Seven Idu Islands and the Southern Islands are undoubtedly products of Quaternary volcanism, whatever may be the history of their foundation. Of these, the dissected basaltic volcanoes Utone-sima, To-sima, Mikura-sima, Higasi-yama (Hatizyo-sima), Tori-sima, and Kita lo-sima probably date to Pleistocene. With the exception of Tori-sima111), we have no record of eruption of any of them. The basaltic volcanoes 0-sima, Miyake-sima, Nisi-yama (Hatizyo-sima), and Aoga-sima have been active in Recent times, all displaying lava out-flows in historic times. The liparitic volcanoes Nii-sima and Kodu-sima, according to records, also have had one eruption each. With the exception of the rarer alkaline rocks (potash-liparite and trachyandesite), the rocks that erupted in the course of the volcanism just outlined above have all several characteristics in common, mineralogical as well as chemical, with however certain differences due to local peculiarities. Whether chemically or mineralogically, there seems to be no systematic difference between the Tertiary and Quaternary series, excepting that the former usually has a higher water-content than the latter. A petropraphic similarity in the Ogasawara rocks to allied rocks from Idu is quite apparent. Of the various rock-types represented, the basalts and basaltic andesites are most predominant besides being regional in distribution, while the others are rather local. These regional rock-types are usually characterized by phenocrysts of calcic plagioclase (anorthite to calcic labradorite) and pyroxenes (augite or hypersthene or both), with or without olivine, in a groundmass containing less calcic plagioclase (bytownite to sodic labradorite), pigeonite, magnetite, and one or more of silica minerals (cristobalite, tridymite, and quartz). It is notable that most of the young lavas from Miyake-sima, Hatizyo-sima, Aoga-sima, etc., are poor in phenocrysts or almost aphyric, while the old lavas from these volcanoes are sometimes strongly porphyritic with large phenocrysts of anorthite. Like the latter, most of the lavas from the Pleistocene basaltic volcanoes (Kita lo-sima, Tori-sima, Mikura-sima, etc.), as also the basalts in the Tertiary series, are strongly porphyritic, sometimes with large phenocrysts of anorthite, the less porphyritic or almost-aphyric rocks being rarely met with. The variation diagram of the aphyric and aphanitic rocks (magma variation diagram) from both the Tertiary series and the Quaternary volcanoes shows smooth curves for all oxides, showing the probable variations in the magmatic liquids from which most of the volcanic rocks of the present region seem to have been derived. The variation diagram of type-averages of the Tertiary porphyritic rocks is identical with the same diagram of the Quaternary porphyritic rocks. The two are again similar to the variation diagram of the well-differentiated rocks of one volcano, namely, Amagi, with the result that either of these two diagrams will represent the chemical variation for rocks of the entire region. The variation on the whole follows that of type-averages of the Japanese volcanic rocks, thus showing the common characteristics that distinguish them from corresponding type-averages of the world's igneous rocks: namely, in containing higher lime, lower alkalies, and larger ratios of iron-oxides to magnesia. But, as compared. with type-averages of the Japanese volcanic rocks, the corresponding type-averages of the present region are usually a little higher in soda but lower in potash. So also do the latter as compared with the rocks from the two other volcanic zones in Japan, namely, the medial volcanic zone of NE. Japan and the Ryukyu volcanic zone. The rocks of the region studied, except a few alkaline rocks, may be treated as a connected suite, all belonging to what Peacock calls the \"calcic series\", with high alkali-lime index, 62・5 for the Tertiary series and 65・7 for the Quaternary series. If the entire suite has originated from a common magma, we would have to admit that acid rocks such as liparites were derived by processes of differentiation from a basaltic magma. During the whole period since the Tertiary, however, volcanism in the present region has been alternately basaltic (or andesitic) and liparitic (or dacitic). This recurrence of similar rock-types points to one of two explanations : (1) either a body of acid magna that had separated out during early Tertiary or before it had remained throughout succeeding ages as an available source of the acid rocks that erupted during several distinct epochs, or (2) that differentiation to an advanced stage had proceeded repeatedly along definite lines at wide intervals of time. Although, of these two alternatives, the former is the more simple, the latter process also must have operated at certain local centres in the region, seeing that well-differentiated rocks intimately related, structurally as well as petrologically, occur in certain central volcanoes such as Amagi. Although the rocks of the so-called Huzi volcanic zone may be treated on the whole as a connected magmatic suite, we find certain differences among them due to local peculiarities, mineralogical as well as chemical. Thus the Huzi rocks differ from the allied rocks of Idu and the Southern Islands in that the former are distinctly higher in alkalies, especially potash, and lower in lime than the latter. So also do the rocks from the volcanoes Kayaga-take and liduna-yama compared with the allied rocks of Idu and the Southern Islands. Although these two volcanoes lie farther north of Huzi, they belong in a wide sense to the Huzi volcanic zone. From these facts in view, the writer believes that the Huzi volcanic zone may be divided petrologically into two subzones, namely, the northern inland zone referred to as the Huzi Volcanic Zone proper, and the southern oceanic zone referred to as the O-sima Volcanic Zone. The Huzi volcanic zone proper includes the inland volcanoes Huzi, Kayaga-take, liduna-yama Kurohime-yama, and many others (Myoko-zan, Yatuga-take volcano group, etc.) yet unstudied, all of which are linearly arranged in a NNW.-SSE. direction on the fossa magna, while the 0-sima volcanic zone includes, in addition to the volcanoes of the Idu peninsula, the insular and submarine volcanoes of the Pacific―the Seven Idu Islands and the Southern Islands. To generalize, although the rocks of the so-called Huzi volcanic zone, with the exception of a feiv alkaline rocks, belong on the whole to a calcic series, the rocks from its northern inland part―the Huzi volcanic zone proper―are higher in alkalies and loiver in lime than those from the southern oceanic part―the O-sima volcanic zone. Whether or not the chemical differences of these two sub-zones are in any way connected with some differences in the geotectonic structure and in the nature of rocks of their foundation is a question we have no means of answering at present. The O-sima volcanic zone just proposed has two kinds of alkaline rocks, namely, potash-liparite (Manzo-yama and Kodu-sima) and trachyandesite (Io-sima). As to the genesis of the potash-liparite, a possible explanation was offered in an earlier paper112). As to the genesis of the trachyandesite, little can be said with certainty at present except that its local distribution in the Volcano Islands group and the occcurrence in it of porphyritic olivine and augite, both of which are similar in microscopic characters to the respective minerals in the basalts from the same group, make it possible that it is genetically related to these basalts. In this connection the distribution of the sites of volcanic vents in the Volcano Islands group calls for notice. Although the general trend of this group is from NNW. to SSE.―that is, the trend of the so-called Huzi volcanic zone―, lo-sima, besides being elongated in outline from NE. to SW., has numerous solfataras which are aligned on fissures running in the same direction. The trachyandesitic submarine volcano, \"Sin-to Volcano\", also lies on a line running NE.-SW. through the basaltic volcano, Minami lo-sima. Similar relation holds between the basaltic and liparitic volcanoes of the Seven Idu Islands11'0. Therefore, if the sites of volcanic vents were fixed by dislocation or lines of weakness in the earth's crust, these two trends―the NNW.-SSE. trend of the basaltic (or andesitic) volcanoes and the NE.-SW. trend of the liparitic (or dacitic) and trachyandesitic volcanoes―may be a surface manifestation of the underground structure of the region, the former representing a principal fracture (Daly's \"abyssal fissure\")114) connected with deep-seated reservoirs of a regional basaltic magma, and the latter a subsidiary fracture connected with shallow-seated reservoirs of local differentiates, either liparitic or trachyandesitic, from the basaltic magma. In conclusion, a few remarks should be added here regarding the alteration through secondary changes of the Tertiary volcanics in Idu, although on this point the writer has not yet been able to gather much information. As already noted, the only rocks that are altered to any important extent are these of the propylite series and the minor intrusives in that series. The common secondary minerals in them are chlorite, calcite, sericite, epidote, limonite, haematite, pyrite, zeolite, albite, and quartz, with amorphous silica, two or more of these minerals always occurring together. The alteration, however, has not advanced to the same degree and in the same way throughout the series. In some parts of the series, most of the rocks are almost unchanged, although, as a rule, incipient alteration of the constituent minerals is found only to a very slight extent, while in many others the alteration is considerable, resulting in virtual disappearance of the original structure of the rock, whether viewed microscopically or in the field. We often find that complete recrystallization has occurred, showing a mosaic of quartz and feldspar, with occasional flakes of sericite and chlorite. Since the alteration of the propylite series has advanced farther not only at and near the contacts with minor intrusives in the series, but also in the intrusives themselves than at distances away from the contacts, it could only have been caused by local and chemical effects, that, is to say, by chemical reactions between the original rocks of the series and some hydrothermal solutions115'that possibly generated in a post-magmatic stage subsequent to the minor intrusions rather than by regional and dynamic agencies. The metamorphic changes justifying the name, propylite, were probably caused by a sodiferous hydrothermal solution, possibly related to the basic intrusives (diabase, porphyrite, basalt, and andesite). The product of this intense mineralization which is so economically important and which has been worked in several parts of the propylite series in the region, was generated probably by a hydrothermal solution rich in silica generally related to the acid intrusives (dacite and liparite or quartz-porphyry). K. Sugi divided the metamorphism of the Misaka series of the Nakagawa district adjoining the northern part of Hakone, which is intruded by a large quartz-diorite mass, and which is a lower Miocene series correlated with the propylite series of Idu, into two stages: dynamic metamorphism caused by a mountain-building movement generated within a geosynclinal area before the intrusion of the quartz-diorite and contact metamorphism at the time of that intrusion116). The writer is of the opinion that the dynamic metamorphism, if it did occur, must have been due merely to local stresses that generated outside the boundary of the quartz-diorite mass at the beginning of the intrusion of that mass, seeing that the metamorphism is quite local in the Misaka series both at and near the contacts with the intrusive, and that such metamorphism is never met with in the propylite series of Idu, which belongs to the same geotectonic unit as the Misaka series.",
  "texts" : [ "20.On the Volcanism of the Huzi Volcanic Zone, with Special Reference to the Geology and Petrology of Idu and the Southern Islands.", "When volcanic activity began in the region studied is a matter of conjecture. There is no doubt, however, that volcanoes were already in existence in Eocene times, seeing that the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands are composed almost exclusively of andesitic rocks, both explosive and effusive, with a few intercalated Eocene limestones. If these islands were located on the submarine ridge that underlies the insular volcanoes of the Huzi volcanic zone, it would be more than likely that the Ogasawara volcanics are products of the earliest recognized forerunner of volcanic activity in that zone, but their more or less outlying position seem to militate against this view. However, notwithstanding the lack of positive evidence indicating structural similarity, the writer presents the above view as a possible explanation, because the Ogasawara andesites show the same general characteristics, both microscopical and chemical, as the allied rocks from the Huzi volcanic zone. The first indisputable record of volcanic activity in the Huzi volcanic zone dates to early Miocene. This seems to be the case not only with the Idu region, in the study of which the writer is chiefly concerned, but also with the much larger region of the \"fossa magna\", of which Idu forms but a small part. Through the whole of the period that succeeded it, the same general sequence of volcanic activity has beeu maintained in most parts of the fossa magna with certain local differences. It is therefore highly probable that, although local volcanic activity had already manifested itself in Eocene times in the Ogasawara Islands, more active and more regional activity had started contemporaneously with the tectonic disturbances, the result of all which is the fossa magna, which severed the geologic continuation between southwestern and northeastern Japan. As to whether or not the Ogasawara Islands were subjected to the same disturbances, the writer is unable to say. The lower Miocene volcanism in Idu, which occurred beneath the sea of that time, is represented by a thick series of highly altered volcanics (lavas and pyroclastics), referred to as the Yugasima beds (or the propylite series). This series consists for the most part of basaltic and andesitic rocks, although dacites and liparites are also represented, especially in the upper horizons of the series. The succession of these rocks implies considerable time, during which certain structural deformations might possibly have recurred, resulting in several periods of volcanic accumulation. But its actual duration is a question we have no means of answering at present, the only precise datum being the faunal evidence (Lepidocyclina limestone from Simo-Siroiwra and Miogypsina limestone from Nasimoto), which assigns certain dacitic volcanics lying some distance above the base of the series to lower Miocene. The propylite series is invaded by numerous minor intrusives (dikes, sheets, and necks) of various rock-types―diabase, porphyrite, basalt, andesite, dacite, and liparite (quartz-porphyry). Although these intrusives are evidently later than the propylite series, not all of them were formed contemporaneously. The basic intrusives (including diabase, porphyrite, basalt, and andesite) are mostly older, all being altered in the same way as the propylite series in which they are found, whereas the more acid intrusives are mostly somewhat younger, being probably correlated with the acid volcanics that overlie unconformably the propylite series. The lower Miocene volcanism was followed, probably during upper Miocene, by submarine eruptions of liparites and dacites, with subordinate andesites, all of'which are distributed mostly in south Idu and rather locally in north Idu. As just mentioned, some of the minor intrusives in the propylite series, especially those of acid rocks, might be the feeders of the upper Miocene volcanics. In contrast with the propylite series, these upper Miocene volcanics are either quite fresh or are but little altered. The foregoing phase of volcanism was succeeded, most probably during lower Pliocene, by a subordinate phase of activity characterized by minor intrusions (dikes) and extrusions of andesites. Regarding volcanism during this period, however, we are largely in the dark as only a few rocks in Idu have been identified with that period. In the uppermost Pliocene, eruptions of basalts, dacites, and andesites, occurred only locally in Idu, and these were again exclusively submarine. At the  close  of the Tertiary or the beginning of the Pleistocene, Idu peninsula was subjected like the other regions in the fossa magma to crustal movement, generally in the sense of uplift, and it was not until some time after this movement, which raised so much of the Tertiary sea-floor into land, that Pleistocene volcanism became vigorous. This volcanism was concentrated mainly in the northern part of the peninsula, while in the southern part, Tertiary volcanism was succeeded by that relative quiescence which marked the Pleistocene aud Recent epochs. The first phase of lower Pleistocene volcanism is thus represented by eruptions of basalts, andesites, and dacites, all occurring in the forms of tuff and tuff-breccia that now occupy the bulk of the lacustrine deposits (Ono beds, Simo-Hata beds, and Simo-Tanna beds) accumulated during that period on the erosion reliefs of the Tertiary formations. It was followed at the end of lower Pleistocene and in the upper Pleistocene, when the lower Pleistocene deposits had been more or less deformed, by eruptions of central volcanoes. The volcanoes Tensi, Usami, Taga, Yugawara, Asitaka, Amagi, Hakone, and others in the northwestern part of the Idu peninsula yet unstudied, as also the dacitic masses in the vicinity of Atami, are ^ all products of this phase of activity, with however certain differences in the times when the activities began and in the period for which they lasted. The basaltic- Omuro-yama group represents the last volcanism in the peninsula, which probably occurred some time later when the older volcanoes Tensi, Usami, Taga, etc., were subjected to more or less dislocation and dissection ; while the numerous hot-springs there represent a stage of post-volcanic thermal activity. So far as its visible part is concerned, Huzi may date from a much later age, probably Recent. That one of the earliest lava-flows from the volcano is younger than the older somma of Hakone has been definitely proved by field evidence. All the insular volcanoes of the Seven Idu Islands and the Southern Islands are undoubtedly products of Quaternary volcanism, whatever may be the history of their foundation. Of these, the dissected basaltic volcanoes Utone-sima, To-sima, Mikura-sima, Higasi-yama (Hatizyo-sima), Tori-sima, and Kita lo-sima probably date to Pleistocene. With the exception of Tori-sima111), we have no record of eruption of any of them. The basaltic volcanoes 0-sima, Miyake-sima, Nisi-yama (Hatizyo-sima), and Aoga-sima have been active in Recent times, all displaying lava out-flows in historic times. The liparitic volcanoes Nii-sima and Kodu-sima, according to records, also have had one eruption each. With the exception of the rarer alkaline rocks (potash-liparite and trachyandesite), the rocks that erupted in the course of the volcanism just outlined above have all several characteristics in common, mineralogical as well as chemical, with however certain differences due to local peculiarities. Whether chemically or mineralogically, there seems to be no systematic difference between the Tertiary and Quaternary series, excepting that the former usually has a higher water-content than the latter. A petropraphic similarity in the Ogasawara rocks to allied rocks from Idu is quite apparent. Of the various rock-types represented, the basalts and basaltic andesites are most predominant besides being regional in distribution, while the others are rather local. These regional rock-types are usually characterized by phenocrysts of calcic plagioclase (anorthite to calcic labradorite) and pyroxenes (augite or hypersthene or both), with or without olivine, in a groundmass containing less calcic plagioclase (bytownite to sodic labradorite), pigeonite, magnetite, and one or more of silica minerals (cristobalite, tridymite, and quartz). It is notable that most of the young lavas from Miyake-sima, Hatizyo-sima, Aoga-sima, etc., are poor in phenocrysts or almost aphyric, while the old lavas from these volcanoes are sometimes strongly porphyritic with large phenocrysts of anorthite. Like the latter, most of the lavas from the Pleistocene basaltic volcanoes (Kita lo-sima, Tori-sima, Mikura-sima, etc.), as also the basalts in the Tertiary series, are strongly porphyritic, sometimes with large phenocrysts of anorthite, the less porphyritic or almost-aphyric rocks being rarely met with. The variation diagram of the aphyric and aphanitic rocks (magma variation diagram) from both the Tertiary series and the Quaternary volcanoes shows smooth curves for all oxides, showing the probable variations in the magmatic liquids from which most of the volcanic rocks of the present region seem to have been derived. The variation diagram of type-averages of the Tertiary porphyritic rocks is identical with the same diagram of the Quaternary porphyritic rocks. The two are again similar to the variation diagram of the well-differentiated rocks of one volcano, namely, Amagi, with the result that either of these two diagrams will represent the chemical variation for rocks of the entire region. The variation on the whole follows that of type-averages of the Japanese volcanic rocks, thus showing the common characteristics that distinguish them from corresponding type-averages of the world's igneous rocks: namely, in containing higher lime, lower alkalies, and larger ratios of iron-oxides to magnesia. But, as compared. with type-averages of the Japanese volcanic rocks, the corresponding type-averages of the present region are usually a little higher in soda but lower in potash. So also do the latter as compared with the rocks from the two other volcanic zones in Japan, namely, the medial volcanic zone of NE. Japan and the Ryukyu volcanic zone. The rocks of the region studied, except a few alkaline rocks, may be treated as a connected suite, all belonging to what Peacock calls the \"calcic series\", with high alkali-lime index, 62・5 for the Tertiary series and 65・7 for the Quaternary series. If the entire suite has originated from a common magma, we would have to admit that acid rocks such as liparites were derived by processes of differentiation from a basaltic magma. During the whole period since the Tertiary, however, volcanism in the present region has been alternately basaltic (or andesitic) and liparitic (or dacitic). This recurrence of similar rock-types points to one of two explanations : (1) either a body of acid magna that had separated out during early Tertiary or before it had remained throughout succeeding ages as an available source of the acid rocks that erupted during several distinct epochs, or (2) that differentiation to an advanced stage had proceeded repeatedly along definite lines at wide intervals of time.

Thus the Huzi rocks differ from the allied rocks of Idu and the Southern Islands in that the former are distinctly higher in alkalies, especially potash, and lower in lime than the latter. So also do the rocks from the volcanoes Kayaga-take and liduna-yama compared with the allied rocks of Idu and the Southern Islands. Although these two volcanoes lie farther north of Huzi, they belong in a wide sense to the Huzi volcanic zone. From these facts in view, the writer believes that the Huzi volcanic zone may be divided petrologically into two subzones, namely, the northern inland zone referred to as the Huzi Volcanic Zone proper, and the southern oceanic zone referred to as the O-sima Volcanic Zone. The Huzi volcanic zone proper includes the inland volcanoes Huzi, Kayaga-take, liduna-yama Kurohime-yama, and many others (Myoko-zan, Yatuga-take volcano group, etc.) yet unstudied, all of which are linearly arranged in a NNW.-SSE. direction on the fossa magna, while the 0-sima volcanic zone includes, in addition to the volcanoes of the Idu peninsula, the insular and submarine volcanoes of the Pacific―the Seven Idu Islands and the Southern Islands. To generalize, although the rocks of the so-called Huzi volcanic zone, with the exception of a feiv alkaline rocks, belong on the whole to a calcic series, the rocks from its northern inland part―the Huzi volcanic zone proper―are higher in alkalies and loiver in lime than those from the southern oceanic part―the O-sima volcanic zone.

As to the genesis of the potash-liparite, a possible explanation was offered in an earlier paper112). As to the genesis of the trachyandesite, little can be said with certainty at present except that its local distribution in the Volcano Islands group and the occcurrence in it of porphyritic olivine and augite, both of which are similar in microscopic characters to the respective minerals in the basalts from the same group, make it possible that it is genetically related to these basalts.

The trachyandesitic submarine volcano, \"Sin-to Volcano\", also lies on a line running NE.-SW. through the basaltic volcano, Minami lo-sima. Similar relation holds between the basaltic and liparitic volcanoes of the Seven Idu Islands11'0. Therefore, if the sites of volcanic vents were fixed by dislocation or lines of weakness in the earth's crust, these two trends―the NNW.-SSE. trend of the basaltic (or andesitic) volcanoes and the NE.-SW. trend of the liparitic (or dacitic) and trachyandesitic volcanoes―may be a surface manifestation of the underground structure of the region, the former representing a principal fracture (Daly's \"abyssal fissure\")114) connected with deep-seated reservoirs of a regional basaltic magma, and the latter a subsidiary fracture connected with shallow-seated reservoirs of local differentiates, either liparitic or trachyandesitic, from the basaltic magma.

  "title" : "Ground deformation monitoring of a potential landslide at La Palma, Canary Islands",
  "description" : "The southern part of the island of La Palms comprises a north-south-oriented volcano known as the Cumbre Vieja. The steep gradient and high aspect ratio of the volcano, coupled with the prospect of future episodes of magma intrusion, highlight the potential for large-scale lateral collapse of the volcano, as recorded earlier in the history of La Palma and elsewhere in the Canary Islands. Historic eruptions of the Cumbre Vieja have occurred high up on the western flank of the volcano and along a single rift zone along the crest of the volcano. The geometry Of the recent activity and faulting which occurred during an eruption in 1949 indicates that a discontinuity may be present beneath the western flank of the volcano, along which a future collapse may occur. To identify any displacement of the western flank overlying the discontinuity, a ground deformation network has recently been established on the volcano. The initial network spanned the fault system that developed on the upper flanks of the Cumbre Vieja during the 1949 eruption. This small network was measured in 1994, 1996 and 1997 using infrared Electronic Distance Measurement. In;1997, the network was enlarged and re-occupied, using the Global Positioning System, to incorporate the west flank and the southern pan of the island. Although the results show that apparent displacements recorded during this period are within the error-margins of the techniques employed, the apparent movement vectors do suggest a coherent westward displacement of stations to the west of the 1949 fault system. Additional occupations of the network over the next few years will, however, be required to determine the reality or otherwise of this apparent coherent movement, and thus to decide whether or not the western flank of the Cumbre Vieja is currently sliding seaward. If not, it can be inferred that the volcano is stable during inter-eruptive periods. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved",

  "title" : "Modeling of Gravity Changes on Merapi Volcano",
  "description" : "Merapi volcano, located in Central Java, is one of the most active volcanoes in Indonesia. 2 million people are living in its immediate neighborhood. Therefore Merapi was selected within the International Decade of Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR) of UNESCO as one of 15 so called high risk volcanoes in the world. National and International research groups from Indonesia, France, Netherlands, Japan, USA and Germany are working on Merapi. Different methods are applied on Merapi to study the volcanic processes and to improve the possibilities to predict future eruptions. In this thesis the importance of gravity changes in space and time for the analysis of volcanic processes is analyzed and further developed. First the basic theory of Earth's gravity field and gravity anomalies is described. For the interpretation of gravity anomalies several programs have been developed using the MATLAB software package. The programs are used for the interpretation of gravity changes in time which have been observed five times between summer 1997 and summer 2000 in a repetition network around Merapi volcano. This network consists of 23 stations. During all campaigns four LaCoste&Romberg gravimeters model G and D have been used. Height changes at the observation sites are controlled by GPS-observations which have been carried out in parallel with the gravity measurements. The observed gravity and height changes are small. They reveal that Merapi volcano is just now an open system where no large stresses can build up. Nevertheless possible models are developed to explain the observed changes. Based on four geometric models of magma chamber and conduit within the volcano?s edifice as found in the literature the migration of magma in the conduit is investigated. The conduit system thereby is modeled by a cylinder, the magma chamber by a sphere. It is shown, that gravity changes map the migration of the magma, if gravity changes at stations at the crater rim are considered. Gravity changes at stations far away from the volcano conduit (2 ? 25 km) can be explained by changes within the geohydrothermal system. For this purpose particular ground water layers as determined by other geophysical methods (resistivity observations, magnetotelluric measurements and LOTEM) are modeled as concentric cylinders around the conduit of Merapi volcano. The resulting density changes in the cylinders explain with sufficient accuracy the observed gravity changes. Precise repeated gravity observations in combination with other geophysical methods allow therefore the detailed analysis of subsurface mass migration within a volcano.",

  "description" : "For many years physicists have been engaged on research around the globe in fields such as the unification of gravita- tion and electromagnetism, and an explanation for dark matter and dark energy, etc., but so far to little avail. One is left with the impression that something might be fundamentally wrong with the premises underlying the doctrine of physics applicable today, which is preventing a solution of these problems from being found. As a possible cause, the author proposes that the gravitation of the photons is not so negligible that it can be completely ignored (although this assumption does not accord with the current state of physics). Departing therefore from the accepted doctrine, he assumes that gravitation might possess a hitherto unknown important influence on electromagnetism. This paper then examines the consequences of this assumption on physics. A precise analysis will lead to the insight that the gravitation of a photon is as dynamic as the photon itself, and therefore must be taken into account with all associated physical considerations. The hitherto accepted case of a static gravitation of photons, on the other hand, can be totally neglected, as it does not exist for photons. Of key importance is the statement that the gravitation of photons is produced by gravitational quanta, and thus appears in quantised form. It is therefore necessary to rethink the physics of photons. This leads to a number of other interesting insights, as will be borne out in the further course of this paper. In the event that the assumption of the influence of gravitation on electromagnetism turns out to be correct, then this would represent a major step in unravelling the still largely unknown nature of gravitation and its significance in the natural events of the microcosmos; furtheron it would be an important contribution regarding a “New Physics” and a “New Cosmology”",

As no generally accepted scientific explanation of the\ncreation and essence of dark matter exists to date, it is to be anticipated\nthat the nonbaryonic dynamic gravitation of photons is of general interest to\nphysicists as well as cosmologists and may serve to initiate a general debate\namong them. Furthermore, this paper will also show that there exists a close\nmutual relationship between electrodynamics <> dynamic gravitation\n<> static gravitation <> electrostatics <> electrodynamics\n(refer to paragraph 4). Due to the fact that the insights into the relationship\nbetween photons and their dynamic gravitation have not been described by any\nother author to date, there exists only a few references that I can cite in\nsupport of my paper.</span> \n</p", null ],

  "description" : "Surface tension (S) is due to the inward force experienced by particles at the surface and usually gravitation does not play an important role in this force. But in compact stars the gravitational force on the particles is very large and S is found to depend not only on the interactions in the strange quark matter, but also on the structure of the star, i.e. on its mass and radius.

Such stars, if they exist, may also go a long way towards explaining away the antibaryon deficit of the universe. For that to happen S must be high enough to allow for survival of quark/antiquark stars born in early stages of the formation of the universe. High value of S may also assist explanation of delayed gamma-ray burst after a supernova explosion, as conversion from normal matter to strange matter takes place.

  "description" : "I review some possible processes by which planets and brown dwarfs can influence the evolution of their parent evolved stars. As sun-like stars evolve on the red giant branch (RGB) and then on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), they will interact with their close planets (if exist). The interaction starts with tidal interaction: this will lead the planets to deposit most of their angular momentum to the envelope of the giant, and then spiral-in to the envelope. (Too many papers dealing with close planets [less than about 3-6 AU] around evolved stars neglect tidal interaction, hence their results are questionable.) They may spin-up their parent stars by up to several orders of magnitude. The interaction of substellar objects with evolved star may enhance the mass loss rate, mainly in the equatorial plane. Possible outcomes are: (i) Planetary systems interacting with their parent AGB star may lead to the formation of moderate elliptical planetary nebulae. (ii) RGB stars which lose more mass turn to bluer horizontal branch (HB) stars. Therefore, planets may explain the formation of blue HB stars.

  "description" : "The currently accepted model for subduction zone magmatism involves metasomatism of the mantle wedge by slab-derived components and then subsequent partial melting of this source. However, there is no consensus on whether the slab-derived component is transferred as a hydrous fluid, a silicate melt, or both. Whether these fluids or melts are derived from the altered oceanic crust, the subducted sediment, or both is also debated. Constraining the nature of the subduction component has important implications for solid-fluid-melt partitioning and slab dehydration depths, particularly elemental budgets and recycling of elements into the deep mantle. Vanuatu is an intra-oceanic subduction zone in the SW Pacific where recent scientific cruises have mapped and dredged submarine lavas that extend the sample coverage of the Vanuatu arc. Major and trace elements and radiogenic isotopes are used to identify the source and transfer mechanism of slab-derived components in the\n  Vanuatu subduction zone. Mixing calculations estimate the mantle wedge, sediment and fluid contributions to Vanuatu arc and backarc lavas. New geochemical results are integrated with the large database of published results for Vanuatu, to investigate the along- and across-arc variation in the slab component and mantle domains. Lavas from the Vanuatu backarc have Indian-like Pb isotope ratios, similar to the Indian-type mantle signatures of central arc volcanoes, but distinct from adjacent southern arc volcanoes with Pacific-like Pb isotope ratios. The Pb isotopic anomaly (∆8/4) in the Vanuatu subduction zone decreases from the central arc segment to the southern backarc, implying trench-parallel flow of Indian-type mantle to the south. The spatial distribution of mantle domains implies that mantle flow patterns in southern Vanuatu are dominated by southward trench-parallel flow, rather than pure corner flow induced by viscous drag along the upper surface of the subducting plate.\n  This southward flow appears to be related to pressure gradients developed during asymmetric rollback of the Australian plate. Despite these unusual mantle dynamics in southern Vanuatu, a subduction component is detectable in the across-arc and backarc lavas. In the southern Vanuatu backarc, the average amount of sediment addition decreases from ~1.2% in the north trough to ~0.3% in the central trough. The average amount of altered oceanic crust fluid addition also decreases from ~0.3% in the northern trough to ~0.1% in the central trough. The southern backarc trough lavas are not enriched in large ion lithophile elements and have light rare earth element depletions, suggesting that these lavas do not have a significant contribution from slab-derived components. In the across-arc volcanoes, the average amount of sediment addition decreases from ~2% in the volcanic front to ~0.5% in the easternmost across-arc volcano. The average amount of altered oceanic crust fluid addition also\n  decreases from ~0.9% in the volcanic front to ~0.3% in the easternmost across-arc volcano. For the backarc and across-arc lavas, sediment and fluid contributions progressively decrease with distance from the trench. Fluid-mobile/fluid-immobile trace element ratios, such as Ba/Yb and Ba/La ratios also decrease with distance from the trench and support progressive distillation of the subducting slab. Enrichment of fluid mobile elements in the southern across-arc volcanoes reflects the addition of hydrous fluids to slab depths of at least 200 km. These constraints on slab dehydration signify that not all fluid mobile elements are recycled at shallow depths. The degree of melting in the across-arc volcanoes progressively decreases with depth to the slab, demonstrating that the degree of melting is not solely controlled by the melt column height. Smaller degree melts from southern Vanuatu have a smaller contribution from slab-derived components. These constraints argue for fluid-fluxed\n  melting, where the extent of melting progressively decreases as the amount of slab-derived fluid decreases.

Here we perform a detailed calculation aimed at quantifying the signatures of photon-axion conversion in the spectra, light curves, and polarization of neutron stars (NSs).

The latter is computed from magnetized atmosphere models that include the effect of photon polarization mode conversion due to vacuum polarization.  The resulting spectral models, inclusive of the general-relativistic effects of gravitational redshift and light deflection, allow us to make realistic predictions for the effects of photon to axion conversion on observed NS spectra, light curves, and polarization signals. We identify unique signatures of the conversion, such as an increase of the effective area of a hot spot as it rotates away from the observer line of sight. For a star emitting from the entire surface, the conversion produces apparent radii that are either larger or smaller (depending on axion mass and coupling strength) than the limits set by NS equations of state. For an emission region that is observed phase-on, photon-axion conversion results in an inversion of the plane of polarization with respect to the no-conversion case.

Assays using transfectants expressing a variety of HLA-Cw6 mutants identified the transmembrane sequence and, in particular, cysteine at position 309 as necessary for inhibition of 68% (25/37) of NK cell lines and 23% (33/145) of NK clones tested. Moreover, these NK clones inhibited by target cell expression of HLA-Cw6 and dependent upon the transmembrane sequence were found not to express or to only dimly express NK inhibitory receptors (NKIR1) that are EB6/HP3E4-positive. Furthermore, assays using monoclonal antibody blocking suggest that an NK receptor other than NKIR1 or CD94 is responsible for recognition dependent upon the transmembrane sequence of HLA-Cw6.", null ],
