  "description" : "Indirect methods to detect extrasolar planets have been successful in identifying a number of stars with companion planets. No direct detection of an extrasolar planet has yet been reported. Spectroscopy in the thermal infrared region provides a potentially powerful approach to detection and characterization of planets and planetary systems. We can use knowledge of our own solar system, its planets and their atmospheres to model spectral characteristics of planets around other stars. Spectra derived from modeling our own solar system seen from an extrasolar perspective can be used to constrain detection strategies, identification of planetary class (terrestrial vs. gaseous) and retrieval of chemical, thermal and dynamical information. Emission from planets in our solar system peaks in the thermal infrared region, approximately 10 - 30 microns, substantially displaced from the maximum of the much brighter solar emission in the visible near 0.5 microns. This fact provides a relatively good contrast ratio to discriminate between stellar (solar) and planetary emission and optimize the delectability of planetary spectra. Important molecular constituents in planetary atmospheres have rotational-vibrational spectra in the thermal infrared region. Spectra from these molecules have been well characterized in the laboratory and studied in the atmospheres of solar system planets from ground-based and space platforms. The best example of such measurements are the studies with Fourier transform spectrometers, the Infrared Interferometer Spectrometers (IRIS), from spacecraft: Earth observed from NIMBUS 8, Mars observed from Mariner 9, and the outer planets observed from Voyager spacecraft. An Earth-like planet is characterized by atmospheric spectra of ozone, carbon dioxide, and water. Terrestrial planets have oxidizing atmospheres which are easily distinguished from reducing atmospheres of gaseous giant planets which lack oxygen-bearing species and are characterized by spectra containing hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane. Spectroscopic information on extrasolar planets thus can permit their classification. Spectra and spectral lines contain information on the temperature structure of the atmosphere. Line and band spectra can be used to identify the molecular constituents and retrieve species abundances, thereby classifying and characterizing the planet. At high enough spectral resolution characteristic planetary atmospheric dynamics and unique phenomena such as failure of local thermodynamic equilibrium can be identified. Dynamically induced effects such as planetary rotation and orbital velocity shift and change the shape of spectral features and must be modeled in detailed spectral studies. We will use our knowledge of the compositional, thermal and dynamical characteristics of planetary atmospheres in our own solar system to model spectra observed remotely on similar planets in extrasolar planetary systems. We will use a detailed radiative transfer and beam integration program developed for the modeling and interpretation of thermal infrared spectra measured from nearby planet planets to generate models of an extra-solar \"Earth\" and \"Jupiter\". From these models we will show how key spectral features distinguish between terrestrial and gaseous planets, what information can be obtained with different spectral resolution, what spectral features can be used to search for conditions for biogenic activity, and how dynamics and distance modify the observed spectra. We also will look at unique planetary phenomena such as atmospheric lasing and discuss their utility as probes for detection and identification of planets. Results of such studies will provide information to constrain design for instrumentation needed to directly detect extrasolar planets.",

Third, the contrast between the selected and non-selected actions was enhanced via improved differentiation of outputs from the BG. Fourth, transient increases in the salience of a non-selected action were prevented from interrupting the ongoing action, unless the transient was of sufficient magnitude. Finally, the selection of the ongoing action persisted when a new closely matched salience action became active. The first result was facilitated by the thalamocortical loop; the rest were dependent on the presence of the TRN.

  "title" : "Reconstructed grounded theory: beyond comparison?",
  "description" : "This paper examines the modifications made to constructed grounded theory for application within an ethnographic study of group work processes in a virtual learning environment. The paper details how the complex professional relationship of educational practitioner research, and the associated ethical issues, together with the variety of data analysed influenced the approach taken. The paper explores how the adaptations to constructed grounded theory process were applied and how this approach can be construed as grounded in grounded theory. <p></p> \r\n\r\nThe paper is explicit about the application and adaptation of grounded theory to meet the needs of the research and the epistemology of the researcher.  Many studies purporting to use grounded theory are less explicit, this paper is intended to contribute to the discussion and development of a flexible approach to grounded theory, fit for purpose within the restraints of a practitioner based virtual educational ethnographic study.<p></p>  \r\n\r\nThe relationship of the practitioner researcher (an Associate Lecturer) and the participants (the students) created a dichotomy between the neutrality and social distance of the researcher and the ethical implications for the Associate Lecturer.  Whilst the participants were not vulnerable adults, many of the participants were novice learners returning to study and therefore a duty of care was required.

  "texts" : [ "Reconstructed grounded theory: beyond comparison?", "This paper examines the modifications made to constructed grounded theory for application within an ethnographic study of group work processes in a virtual learning environment. The paper details how the complex professional relationship of educational practitioner research, and the associated ethical issues, together with the variety of data analysed influenced the approach taken. The paper explores how the adaptations to constructed grounded theory process were applied and how this approach can be construed as grounded in grounded theory. <p></p> \r\n\r\nThe paper is explicit about the application and adaptation of grounded theory to meet the needs of the research and the epistemology of the researcher.  Many studies purporting to use grounded theory are less explicit, this paper is intended to contribute to the discussion and development of a flexible approach to grounded theory, fit for purpose within the restraints of a practitioner based virtual educational ethnographic study.<p></p>  \r\n\r\nThe relationship of the practitioner researcher (an Associate Lecturer) and the participants (the students) created a dichotomy between the neutrality and social distance of the researcher and the ethical implications for the Associate Lecturer.  Whilst the participants were not vulnerable adults, many of the participants were novice learners returning to study and therefore a duty of care was required.

The information obtained was that borne by the light that was transmitted from the distant celestial object through the atmosphere to the observing instrument on the ground. In recent years the light waves have been supplemented by radio waves as carriers of information from the stars and planets.

The history of advances in astronomical knowledge and technique includes the records of Chinese, Babylonians, Greeks, Arabians, and of nearly every nation of the modern world.

In addition, there is mounting evidence that metabolic coupling occurs in aggressive tumors, between epithelial cancer cells and the stromal compartment, and between well-oxygenated and hypoxic compartments. We recently showed that oxidative stress in the tumor stroma, due to aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction, is important for cancer cell mutagenesis and tumor progression.

These findings explain why it is effective to treat tumors with either inducers or inhibitors of autophagy, as both would disrupt this energetic coupling.

Ammonia production in cancer cells, in turn, could then help maintain autophagy in the tumor stromal compartment. In this vicious cycle, the initial glutamine provided to cancer cells would be produced by autophagy in the tumor stroma. Thus, we believe that parasitic epithelial-stromal metabolic coupling has important implications for cancer diagnosis and therapy, for example, in designing novel metabolic imaging techniques and establishing new targeted therapies.

  "title" : "PERIODIC DISTURBANCE REJECTION OF NONLINEAR SYSTEMS",
  "description" : "Disturbance rejection is an important topic in control design since disturbances are inevitable in practical systems. To realise this target for nonlinear systems, this thesis brings in an assumption about the existence of a controlled invariant mani- fold and a Desired Feedforward Control (DFC) which is contained in the input to compensate the influence of disturbances. According to the approximation property of Neural Networks (NN) that any periodic signals defined in a compact set can be approximated by NN, the NN-based disturbance approximator is applied to approximate the DFC. Algorithmically, two important types of NN approximators that are Multi-layer Neural Networks (MNN) and Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNN) are presented in detail.In this thesis, a variety of nonlinear systems in standard canonical form are looked into. These forms are the output feedback form, the extended output feedback form, the decentralised output feedback form and the partial state feedback form. For these systems, four types of uncertainties are mainly considered. The first one is the disturbance that can be eliminated by the DFC. Secondly, the parameter uncertainty is taken into account. To get rid of this uncertainty, the adaptive control technique is employed for the estimation of unknown parameters, e.g. the NN gain matrix. The third one is the nonlinear uncertainty. For the case that nonlinear uncertainties are polynomials, it has a bound consisting of an unknown constant and a function of the regulated error such that this uncertainty can be also treated as the parameter uncertainty. Delay is the last type of uncertainty. Particularly, the delay is supposed to appear in output only. This uncertainty can be eliminated together with the nonlinear uncertainty. To establish the closed- loop stability, a Lyapunov-Krasovskii function is invoked. In addition, due to the requirement of the system structure or the stability analysis, some general control techniques are also involved such like the backstepping control and the high gain control.Throughout the results are illustrated by simulations.",

Here, we present computational classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the behavior of U(VI) in contact with different calcite surfaces.

Immobilization of biomolecules leads to the formation of biomimetic substrates, improving cell response. We introduced RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) sequences on poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) film surfaces using thiol chemistry to enhance Schwann cell (SC) response. XPS elemental analysis indicated an estimate of 2-3% peptide functionalization on the PCL surface, comparable with carbodiimide chemistry. Contact angle was not remarkably reduced; hence, cell response was only affected by chemical cues on the film surface. Adhesion and proliferation of Schwann cells were enhanced after PCL modification. Particularly, RGD immobilization increased cell attachment up to 40% after 6 h of culture. It was demonstrated that SC morphology changed from round to very elongated shape when surface modification was carried out, with an increase in the length of cellular processes up to 50% after 5 days of culture. Finally RGD immobilization triggered the formation of focal adhesion related to higher cell spreading. In summary, this study provides a method for immobilization of biomolecules on PCL films to be used in peripheral nerve repair, as demonstrated by the enhanced response of Schwann cells.",

  "title" : "The innate immune rheostat: influence on lung inflammatory disease and secondary bacterial pneumonia.",
  "description" : "The activity of innate immunity is not simply dictated by the presence of an antigen but also by the balance between negative regulatory and immune potentiator pathways. Even in the absence of antigen, innate immunity can 'inflame' if negative regulators are absent. This resting state is adaptable and dictated by environmental influences, host genetics and past infection history.

The suppression of boron thermal diffusion above the critical fluorine dose correlates with the appearance of a shallow fluorine peak on the (SIMS) profile in the vicinity of the boron marker layer. This shallow fluorine peak is present in samples with and without boron marker layers, and hence it is not due to a chemical interaction between the boron and the fluorine.

  "title" : "Record of seamount production and off-axis evolution in the western North Atlantic Ocean, 25°25′–27°10′N",
  "description" : "Using multibeam bathymetry, we identified 86 axial and 1290 off-axis seamounts (near-circular volcanoes with heights ≥70 m) in an area of 75,000 km2 on the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR), 25°25′N to 27°10′N, extending ∼400 km from the inner rift valley floor to ∼29 Ma crust. Our study shows that seamounts are a common morphological feature of the North Atlantic seafloor. Seamount-producing volcanism occurs primarily on the inner rift valley floor, and few, if any, seamounts are formed on the rift valley walls or the ridge flank. The high abundance of off-axis seamounts is consistent with 1–3 km wide sections of oceanic crust being transferred intact from the axial valley to the ridge flank on crust >4 Ma. Significant changes in seamount abundances, sizes, and shapes are attributed to the effects of faulting between ∼0.6 and 2 m.y. off axis in the lower rift valley walls. Few seamounts are completely destroyed by (inward facing) faults, and population abundances are similar to those on axis. However, faulting reduces the characteristic height of the seamount population significantly. In the upper portions of the rift valley, on 2–4 Ma crust, crustal aging processes (sedimentation and mass wasting), together with additional outward facing faults, destroy and degrade a significant number of seamounts. Beyond the crest of the rift mountains (>4 Ma crust) faulting is no longer active, and changes in the off-axis seamount population reflect crustal aging processes as well as temporal changes in seamount production that occurred at the ridge axis. Estimates of population density for off-axis seamounts show a positive correlation to crustal thickness inferred from analysis of gravity data, suggesting that increased seamount production accompanies increased magma input at the ridge axis. We find no systematic variations in seamount population density along isochron within individual ridge segments. Possible explanations are that along-axis production of seamounts is uniform or that seamount production is enhanced in some regions (e.g., segment centers), but many seamounts do not meet our counting criteria because they are masked by younger volcanic eruptions and low-relief flows.Author Posting. © American Geophysical Union, 2000.

  "texts" : [ "Record of seamount production and off-axis evolution in the western North Atlantic Ocean, 25°25′–27°10′N", "Using multibeam bathymetry, we identified 86 axial and 1290 off-axis seamounts (near-circular volcanoes with heights ≥70 m) in an area of 75,000 km2 on the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR), 25°25′N to 27°10′N, extending ∼400 km from the inner rift valley floor to ∼29 Ma crust. Our study shows that seamounts are a common morphological feature of the North Atlantic seafloor. Seamount-producing volcanism occurs primarily on the inner rift valley floor, and few, if any, seamounts are formed on the rift valley walls or the ridge flank. The high abundance of off-axis seamounts is consistent with 1–3 km wide sections of oceanic crust being transferred intact from the axial valley to the ridge flank on crust >4 Ma. Significant changes in seamount abundances, sizes, and shapes are attributed to the effects of faulting between ∼0.6 and 2 m.y. off axis in the lower rift valley walls. Few seamounts are completely destroyed by (inward facing) faults, and population abundances are similar to those on axis. However, faulting reduces the characteristic height of the seamount population significantly. In the upper portions of the rift valley, on 2–4 Ma crust, crustal aging processes (sedimentation and mass wasting), together with additional outward facing faults, destroy and degrade a significant number of seamounts. Beyond the crest of the rift mountains (>4 Ma crust) faulting is no longer active, and changes in the off-axis seamount population reflect crustal aging processes as well as temporal changes in seamount production that occurred at the ridge axis. Estimates of population density for off-axis seamounts show a positive correlation to crustal thickness inferred from analysis of gravity data, suggesting that increased seamount production accompanies increased magma input at the ridge axis. We find no systematic variations in seamount population density along isochron within individual ridge segments. Possible explanations are that along-axis production of seamounts is uniform or that seamount production is enhanced in some regions (e.g., segment centers), but many seamounts do not meet our counting criteria because they are masked by younger volcanic eruptions and low-relief flows.Author Posting. © American Geophysical Union, 2000.

  "description" : "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a frequent cause of severe lung disease in young children. Primed T cells are required for virus clearance, but are causally implicated in the enhanced pathology seen following RSV infection of some infants and experimental animals vaccinated against the virus.

The production of IFN-gamma, IL-2, -4, -5 and -10 cytokine mRNA by RT-PCR and intracellular cytokines by flow cytometry following RSV challenge of vaccinated mice were therefore compared. Lung eosinophilia was associated with enhanced local recruitment of CD4+ cells in G sensitized mice, while CD8+ cells dominated in mice vaccinated with the viral fusion protein (F) or second matrix protein (M2). Lung eosinophilia was also associated with a localized reduction in IFN-gamma and increased IL-4 and IL-5 mRNA transcription as well as elevated RSV specific IgG1 antibody production. Th2 cytokine protein production by T cells showed no apparent change. Although IFN-gamma production diminished in eosinophilic mice, it remained the major cytokine found in lung T cells.

  "description" : "Friction joining techniques, such as Friction Stir Spot Welding (FSSW) and high power Ultrasonic Welding (USW), could offer a solution for joining dissimilar materials combinations, such as aluminium (Al) to magnesium (Mg), where high intermetallic reaction rates make the use of conventional joining techniques problematic. Ultrasonic welds have been produced between 1 mm gauge Al 6111-T4 and Mg AZ31-H24 sheets, and the interfacial reaction has been studied as a function of welding time. For this welding system, the mechanical properties of the joints were optimised when a double reed welding system was employed to join materials that had been prepared using 800 grit SiC paper under a clamping force of 1.9 kN, and when the materials were oriented with the rolling direction parallel to the vibration direction. Welds produced between Al and Mg achieved similar peak lap shear strengths to those produced between Mg and Mg at welding times of 0.4 s, but the failure energy of the Al-Mg welds was less than half that of the parent material. In addition, the Al-Mg welds always failed at the interface between the sheets, rather than the desirable, and more energy intensive, pullout mechanism. The inferior mechanical properties were attributed to the rapid formation of a brittle intermetallic layer that initially formed as islands of the γ-Al12Mg17 phase. These islands rapidly spread and became continuous within 0.3 s of welding time, at which point a second sublayer of the β-Al3Mg2 phase began to form on the Al side of the intermetallic reaction layer. The combined layers reached a total thickness of 20 µm within 0.9 s of welding time, with the β-Al3Mg2 sublayer becoming the thicker of the two by this point. At longer welding times, interface liquation was observed at temperatures below the recognised lowest temperature eutectic reaction in the Al-Mg binary phase diagram. This was the result of the alloying elements present in the system and there was no depression in the melting point as a result of the high strain rate associated with this process, as has been proposed elsewhere. The rate of growth of the intermetallic layer during welding was higher than in static heat treatments, which was most likely due to the deformation causing microcracking in the brittle intermetallic layer, allowing short circuit diffusion to occur, and enhancing the growth rate by a factor of approximately 2. Finally, attempts were made to limit the rate of intermetallic compound (IMC) formation by applying coatings to the Mg sheet. The effect of the coatings was to reduce the overall IMC layer thickness by 50 %.",

The potential use of carbon nanotube-polymer composites for field emission based displays is also discussed. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.</p>", null ],

  "description" : "Bacteriohopanepolyols (BHPs) and glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) have potential as soil-tracing biomarkers for the extensive shelves of the Arctic Ocean. In this work these biomarkers were analysed in surface sediments along a well characterised sub-Arctic transect in the northernmost Baltic Sea from the Kalix River to the central Bothnian Bay to assess their environmental behaviour and potential for tracing the contribution of soil in this type of system. There was a high BHP diversity and enhanced total BHP concentration in the estuarine sediments, whereas a much less diverse pattern could be observed in the open bay with lower total BHP concentration. In addition, both soil marker BHPs (adenosylhopanes) and branched GDGTs were substantially more abundant in the estuarine than the open bay sediments. The R soil ′ index, based on the Rsoil index minus the contribution from the methylated soil marker BHPs, is suggested as a new approach for tracing soil derived organic matter (OM) in the (sub)-Arctic region. The index decreased along the transect in an off-river direction, correlating strongly with both the branched and isoprenoid tetraether (BIT) index and the stable carbon isotopic composition of the sedimentary organic carbon.

  "title" : "Experimental studies of anomalous radon activity in the Tlamacas Mountain, Popocatepetl Volcano area, México: new tools to study lithosphere-atmosphere coupling for forecasting volcanic and seismic events",
  "description" : "&lt;p&gt;This study presents and discusses the results of soil radon monitoring at three different volcano sites and one reference site, from December 2007 to January 2009. This relates to the activity of the Popocatepetl Volcano and a radon survey and gamma-ray spectrometry in the area between Paso de Cortes and Tlamacas Mountain, and in the adjacent regions. The results are applied to the aspects of atmosphere electricity and lithosphere-atmosphere coupling in relation to the forecasting of volcano and earthquake activity. The monitoring of radon release reveals a decrease in radon concentration (down to total suppression) with approaching moderate volcanic eruptions. The behavior of the radon activity at the Tlamacas site is more apparent, compared to other observational sites. The average level of radon release observed at the Tlamacas site is much higher, with some characteristic variations. Both the radon survey and gamma-ray spectrometry indicate intensive diffusion radon emission localized in the area of Tlamacas Mountain. The average radon concentration in the area of Tlamacas is about 10-20-fold greater than the background volcano values. The new concept of lithosphere-atmosphere coupling is presented: intensive radon release in high elevated areas shortens and modifies the Earth-to-thunderclouds electric circuit, which provokes microdischarges into the air close to the ground, attracting lightning discharges. This concept attempts to explain in a new way the noise-like geomagnetic emissions registered before major earthquakes, and it promotes interest for the study of thunderstorm activity in seismo-active zones, as a promising instrument for earthquake forecasting.&lt;/p&gt",

  "title" : "Using multivariate calibration to evaluate hominin brain/body size relationships",
  "description" : "Modern humans are highly encephalized, having relatively large brains despite our already large bodies. The current assumption is that brains and bodies have both increased in size during the course of human evolution but the rate, timing, and evolutionary relationship of the two are still unclear.

  "description" : "Gaussian linear information arises in many real-world models of the natural and social sciences. The Gaussian distribution has turned out to appropriately represent uncertainty in many linear models. The main goal of this thesis is to describe and to compare different algebras of Gaussian linear information: Corresponding elements and operations in the various algebras are revealed and the respective computational advantages are highlighted. In order to make large models computationally tractable, they have to be decomposed into independent factors by exploiting sparsity. For such factorisations, valuation algebras provide a general, abstract framework for local computations. A valuation algebra is a two-sorted algebra with three operations: valuations (which may be seen as pieces of information) refer to a domain of interest; valuations can be marginalised (focussed) to a domain of interest, and they may be combined (aggregated). Generic message-passing schemes can be used to answer projection problems. Many problems in applications can be reduced to a projection problem: diagnostic estimation, prediction, filtering, smoothing. For instance, Gaussian densities form a valuation algebra: marginalisation is integration, and combination is multiplication (plus renormalisation). Gaussian densities may be represented by Gaussian potentials or moment matrices, using either the concentration or the variance-covariance matrix, respectively. Here, marginalisation and combination are matrix operations. A conditional Gaussian density is the family of Gaussian densities obtained on the head variables by fixing a value for the tail variables. A conditional Gaussian density corresponds to a Gaussian density on the head variables plus a linear regression on the tail variables. Conditional Gaussian densities can be analysed in three ways: geometric, algebraic and analytic. General Gaussian linear systems lead to Gaussian hints by assumption-based inference. Gaussian hints have focal sets which are parallel linear manifolds of the same dimension in the parameter space. Combination corresponds to intersection of focal sets and marginalisation to projection of focal sets. Gaussian potentials correspond to Gaussian hints whose focal sets are all singletons. Gaussian potentials can be extended to a valuation algebra of quotients which are represented by pairs of Gaussian potentials. Conditional Gaussian densities can be represented in the so-called separative extension of Gaussian potentials. Since a conditional Gaussian density is a quotient function of two Gaussian densities, the concentration matrix in the exponent of the denominator can be subtracted from the concentration matrix in the exponent of the numerator. This leads to a new representation of symmetric Gaussian potentials whose pseudo-concentration matrix is only symmetric but not necessarily positive definite. The main result of these considerations is that different conditional Gaussian densities turn out to be linked to the same Gaussian hints (up to equivalence) if and only if the conditional Gaussian densities are equal up to a constant factor. In other words, Gaussian likelihood functions bear the full information contained in Gaussian hints. This explains why assumption-based reasoning on (over-)determined Gaussian linear systems reproduces the estimation results based on the maximum-likelihood principle. Variables may be linear combinations of other variables. This imposes linear restrictions on the parameter space. In the spirit of assumption-based reasoning, algorithms for inference, the combination and marginalisation are derived for symmetric Gaussian potentials with deterministic equations. Finally, it is shown how Gaussian linear systems can be expressed in the language Abel. Queries on a complex Gaussian linear system can be answered in the Abel system.

  "title" : "Modeling of Gravity Changes on Merapi Volcano",
  "description" : "Merapi volcano, located in Central Java, is one of the most active volcanoes in Indonesia. 2 million people are living in its immediate neighborhood. Therefore Merapi was selected within the International Decade of Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR) of UNESCO as one of 15 so called high risk volcanoes in the world. National and International research groups from Indonesia, France, Netherlands, Japan, USA and Germany are working on Merapi. Different methods are applied on Merapi to study the volcanic processes and to improve the possibilities to predict future eruptions. In this thesis the importance of gravity changes in space and time for the analysis of volcanic processes is analyzed and further developed. First the basic theory of Earth's gravity field and gravity anomalies is described. For the interpretation of gravity anomalies several programs have been developed using the MATLAB software package. The programs are used for the interpretation of gravity changes in time which have been observed five times between summer 1997 and summer 2000 in a repetition network around Merapi volcano. This network consists of 23 stations. During all campaigns four LaCoste&Romberg gravimeters model G and D have been used. Height changes at the observation sites are controlled by GPS-observations which have been carried out in parallel with the gravity measurements. The observed gravity and height changes are small. They reveal that Merapi volcano is just now an open system where no large stresses can build up. Nevertheless possible models are developed to explain the observed changes. Based on four geometric models of magma chamber and conduit within the volcano?s edifice as found in the literature the migration of magma in the conduit is investigated. The conduit system thereby is modeled by a cylinder, the magma chamber by a sphere. It is shown, that gravity changes map the migration of the magma, if gravity changes at stations at the crater rim are considered. Gravity changes at stations far away from the volcano conduit (2 ? 25 km) can be explained by changes within the geohydrothermal system. For this purpose particular ground water layers as determined by other geophysical methods (resistivity observations, magnetotelluric measurements and LOTEM) are modeled as concentric cylinders around the conduit of Merapi volcano.

  "description" : "The Igwisi Hills volcanoes (IHV), Tanzania, are unique and important in preserving extra-crater lavas and pyroclastic edifices.

  "title" : "Characterising the Innate and Adaptive Immune Response to Intestinal Helminth infection",
  "description" : "Abstract Gastrointestinal parasites are one of the most prevalent infections known to infect mammals, estimated to affect over one billion people globally. It is well established that the generation of a type two response, characterised by CD4+ T cell secretion of interleukin (IL)-13, IL-4 and IL-9 will expel most gastrointestinal helminths. Expulsion is mediated by a variety of effector mechanisms including altered mucin production, intestinal mast cell activation, increased epithelial cell turnover and increased muscle contraction. Protective immunity can be generated over time; however, infections can persist to chronicity following the modulation of a protective type two response, such as the generation of a type one response. This response, characterised by IFN-γ and IL 12 secretion, can lead to long lived infections, placing huge morbidity upon infected individuals. The mechanisms leading to the generation of a type one or type two response are not fully understood and are of paramount importance if a vaccine to helminth parasites is to be developed. In addition, the dysregulation of these responses is thought to be the cause of allergy and autoimmunity and understanding the regulation of type two responses will also add to our understanding of these diseases.Numerous labs have recently reported roles for new innate cells, such as nuocytes, as sources of IL 13, a cytokine critical to worm expulsion.  In addition, data from this lab has demonstrated that NK cell derived IL-13 is the cause of pathology during infection with Trichinella spiralis. It has also been shown that NK cells provide a supplementary source of IL-13 in Trichuris muris infected IL-4-/- mice. This thesis has used 2 strains of mice; the E4bp4-/- mouse and the Il13eGFP reporter mouse, in order to dissect the role of innate cells in the immune response to the related helminth parasites T. muris and T. spiralis. The transcription factor E4BP4 has been shown to control CD4+ T cell IL-5 and 13 secretion and the development of NK cells. Data presented in this thesis shows that following a low dose infection, which usually persists to chronicity in WT mice, E4bp4-/- mice were able to expel the parasite following the generation of an elevated type two response. This effect was abrogated following CD4+ T cell depletion, indicative of an essential role for these cells in this response. It was also shown that E4BP4 ablation was sufficient to delay expulsion of a high dose of T. muris, indicative of a key role for E4BP4 in regulating type two responses to T. muris. Contrary to the hypothesis, it was demonstrated that NK cells did not play a major role in protective immunity to T. muris.In addition, the data presented here shows, for the first time, the induction of nuocytes in the MLN following both T. muris and T. spiralis infection. Nuocytes made an early contribution to IL-13 secretion following T. spiralis infection; whereas low levels of Il13eGFP+ cells were observed only at day 18-21 post T. muris infection, with nuocytes making a less significant contribution to IL-13 levels. The levels of different cell lineages in the MLN post infection and their contribution to IL-13 expression was also mapped in detail.Finally, an analysis of the haematopoietic response in the bone marrow following T. muris infection was undertaken. The percentage and number of early progenitor Lineage-Sca-1+c-kit+ (LSK) cells in the bone marrow increased at day 21 post T. muris infection. LSK levels returned to normal after this time, indicative of an inflammation dependent response. Interestingly, E4bp4 ablation abrogated this effect, in line with the hypothesised role of IFN-γ in this expansion. Taken together, this data has added to our knowledge of the orchestration of immune responses to two intestinal helminth parasites; T. muris and T. spiralis.",
  "texts" : [ "Characterising the Innate and Adaptive Immune Response to Intestinal Helminth infection", "Abstract Gastrointestinal parasites are one of the most prevalent infections known to infect mammals, estimated to affect over one billion people globally. It is well established that the generation of a type two response, characterised by CD4+ T cell secretion of interleukin (IL)-13, IL-4 and IL-9 will expel most gastrointestinal helminths. Expulsion is mediated by a variety of effector mechanisms including altered mucin production, intestinal mast cell activation, increased epithelial cell turnover and increased muscle contraction. Protective immunity can be generated over time; however, infections can persist to chronicity following the modulation of a protective type two response, such as the generation of a type one response.

  "description" : "To elucidate the network that maintains high fidelity genome replication, we have introduced two conditional mutant alleles of DNA2, an essential DNA replication gene, into each of the approximately 4,700 viable yeast deletion mutants and determined the fitness of the double mutants. Fifty-six DNA2-interacting genes were identified. Clustering analysis of genomic synthetic lethality profiles of each of 43 of the DNA2-interacting genes defines a network (consisting of 322 genes and 876 interactions) whose topology provides clues as to how replication proteins coordinate regulation and repair to protect genome integrity. The results also shed new light on the functions of the query gene DNA2, which, despite many years of study, remain controversial, especially its proposed role in Okazaki fragment processing and the nature of its in vivo substrates. Because of the multifunctional nature of virtually all proteins at the replication fork, the meaning of any single genetic interaction is inherently ambiguous. The multiplexing nature of the current studies, however, combined with follow-up supporting experiments, reveals most if not all of the unique pathways requiring Dna2p. These include not only Okazaki fragment processing and DNA repair but also chromatin dynamics.",

L de¯ning a binary algebraic\noperation on L : let fe1; e2; : : : ; eng be a basis of the algebra L: Then the table\nof multiplication of L is represented by point (°k\nij) of this a±ne space as follows:\n¸(ei; ej) =\nXn\nk=1\n°k\nijek:\nHere °k\nij are called structural constants of L: The linear reductive group GLn(K)\nacts on Algn(K) by (g ¤ ¸)(x; y) = g(¸(g¡1(x); g¡1(y)))(\\transport of struc-\nture\"). Two algebra structures ¸1 and ¸2 on V are isomorphic if and only if\nthey belong to the same orbit under this action.Recall that an algebra L over a ¯eld K is called a Leibniz algebra if its binary\noperation satis¯es the following Leibniz identity:\n[x; [y; z]] = [[x; y]; z] ¡ [[x; z]; y];\nLeibniz algebras were introduced by J.-L.Loday. (For this reason, they have\nalso been called \\Loday algebras\"). A skew-symmetric Leibniz algebra is a Lie\nalgebra. In this case the Leibniz identity is just the Jacobi identity.\nThis research is devoted to the classi¯cation problem of Leibn in low dimen-\nsional cases. There are two sources to get such a classi¯cation. The ¯rst of\nthem is naturally graded non Lie ¯liform Leibniz algebras and another one\nis naturally graded ¯liform Lie algebras. Here we consider Leibniz algebras\nappearing from the naturally graded non Lie ¯liform Leibniz algebras.\nIt is known that this class of algebras can be split into two subclasses. How-\never, isomorphisms within each class have not been investigated yet.

V form a vector space Hom(V ­\nV; V ) of dimensional n3, which can be considered together with its natural\nstructure of an a±ne algebraic variety over K and denoted by Algn(K) »= Kn3 .\nAn n-dimensional algebra L over K can be considered as an element ¸(L) of\nAlgn(K) via the bilinear mapping ¸ : L ­ L !

In this case the Leibniz identity is just the Jacobi identity.\nThis research is devoted to the classi¯cation problem of Leibn in low dimen-\nsional cases. There are two sources to get such a classi¯cation. The ¯rst of\nthem is naturally graded non Lie ¯liform Leibniz algebras and another one\nis naturally graded ¯liform Lie algebras.

GFI1 and GFI1B are able to trigger, in the absence of RUNX1, the down-regulation of endothelial markers and the formation of round cells, a morphologic change characteristic of EHT. Conversely, blood progenitors in Gfi1- and Gfi1b-deficient embryos maintain the expression of endothelial genes.

  "title" : "Experimental petrology of basalts\r\nand their source rocks",
  "description" : "This volume is concerned with the basaltic effluent\r\nfrom planetary interiors, and this chapter is concerned\r\nwith the extent to which experimental petrology of\r\nbasalts can inform us about the composition and mineralogy\r\nof the source material within the interiors of\r\nplanets. If the compositions of sources can be deduced\r\nusing the experimental petrology of basalts, or in any\r\nother way (Chapter 4), then the relationship between\r\nsource rock and basaltic magma can be investigated by\r\ncomplementary experiments using the proposed source\r\nmaterial. Basaltic volcanism appears to be a characteristic\r\nfeature of most investigated planetary surfaces (Chapters\r\n2 and 5), with basalts being produced either when\r\ninternal temperatures become high enough to cause\r\npartial melting of the planetary rock, or when impacts\r\nby other bodies raise the temperature high enough to\r\ncause partial or complete melting of near-surface rocks.\r\nThe main variables to be considered in these processes\r\nare the pressure and equivalent depth, the temperature,\r\nand the composition and mineralogy of the planetary\r\ninterior and near-surface rocks.\r\nOf these three variables, the value of pressure as a\r\nfunction of depth is the best known. A given pressure is\r\nachieved at depths that vary considerably from one\r\nplanetary body to another as illustrated in Fig. 3.1.1.\r\nTemperature is a variable that changes as a function\r\nof time, and as a function of process (Chapter 9).\r\nConvective movements within a planet, for example,\r\ninfluence both the rate of heat transport to the surface,\r\n0\r\nand the development of regional variations in temperature\r\ndistribution versus depth. The temperature produced\r\nby meteoritic or planetesimal bombardment\r\ndepends upon the mass, velocity, and frequency of\r\nimpacting bodies. Variations reviewed in Chapter 9\r\nindicate the extent of our uncertainty about the temperatures\r\nof planetary interiors, even for our own planet.\r\nFigure 3.1.2 shows three geotherms that have been\r\nproposed for a convecting mantle within the present\r\nEarth (Solomon, 1976). The geotherms drawn for the\r\nlithosphere (shallower than about 100 km) are passed\r\nthrough the zones plotted by Solomon ( 1976) for values\r\nestimated from study of peridotite nodules from the\r\nmantle; these geotherms are similar to those calculated\r\nfor conduction models (e.g., Clark and Ringwood,\r\n1964). Temperatures in a region of upwelling, beneath\r\nocean ridges for example, are higher than temperatures\r\nbeneath normal ocean plates. The temperatures shown\r\nbeneath shield and ocean plates become identical at 200\r\nkm depth (contrast Jordan, 1975).\r\nThe third variable, the composition and mineralogy\r\nof basalt source regions, is what we seek to determine\r\nfrom experimental petrology of erupted basalts.\r\nFor the Earth, however, we already have a fairly well-defined\r\nmodel for the structure and petrology of the\r\nmantle, based on cosmochemistry, geophysics, and\r\npetrology (Chapter 4). The composition corresponds to\r\nthat of a peridotite dominated at low pressures by olivine\r\nand two pyroxene minerals. Figure 3.1.2 outlines the\r\nmain phase relationships for this material up to pressures of 250 kb, corresponding to a depth of 700 km\r\nwithin the Earth. For other planetary bodies dominated\r\nby the components of olivine and pyroxenes, the phase\r\nrelationships would be similar, but the specific depth\r\nscales would differ (Fig. 3.1.1 ).\r\nBasaltic magmas are generated within the melting\r\ninterval (crystals + liquid), when the temperature\r\nbecomes high enough to cross the solidus. According\r\nto the terrestrial geotherms given in Fig. 3.1.2, melting\r\ndoes not occur at all beneath shield and ocean plates,\r\nand therefore some special circumstance is required\r\nto increase the temperature locally to account for the\r\noceanic volcanoes and the continental flood basalts. It\r\nis generally assumed that upward convection of mantle\r\nmaterial raises the temperature at relatively shallow\r\nlevels, as indicated by the geotherm associated with\r\nmantle upwelling beneath ocean ridges in Fig. 3.1.2. In\r\nthis tectonic environment, a geotherm crosses the solidus\r\nat depths of 70 ± 40 km (sections 3.3.7 and 3.3.8).\r\nEach planetary body has characteristics that dis- ,\r\ntinguish it from the others, even if it should turn out that\r\nmost of them have similar major element compositions.\r\nThe different pressure-depth relationships suggest that\r\ntemperature distribution curves are likely to intersect\r\nsolidus curves at different pressures on the different\r\nbodies. The phase relationships shown in Fig. 3.1.2\r\nmay be changed by variations in Fe, Mg, Ca, and Al\r\nproportions, and changed radically by the addition of\r\nvolatile components (sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3). For parts\r\nof the Earth's interior containing traces of CO_2 and\r\nH_2O, there is a wide interval of incipient melting below\r\nthe solidus plotted in Fig. 3.1.2. For the Moon, in\r\ncontrast, the concentration of volatile components\r\nappears to be negligible. The oxygen fugacity of lunar\r\nrocks is much lower than that of terrestrial rocks. Mars\r\nmay be enriched in Fe and S compared with Earth and\r\nMoon (McGetchin and Smyth, 1978). The occurrence\r\nof partial melting and volcanism depends upon the\r\nmaintenance of sufficiently high temperatures and thus\r\nupon the body's thermal history (Chapter 9). Parent\r\nbodies of basaltic achondrite meteorites are believed to\r\nhave solidified at an early stage in the development of\r\nthe solar system, and active volcanism on the Moon\r\nceased relatively early in its history. Mars appears to\r\nhave ceased evolving, and the Earth continues with\r\nactive volcanism caused to a large extent by the mass\r\nmovement associated with plate tectonics. Therefore, in\r\nconsidering the basaltic volcanism of each planetary\r\nbody, we have different characteristics, and different\r\nground rules for interpretation. The spectacular eruptions\r\non Io were not anticipated according to preexisting\r\nground rules. The purpose of this chapter is to outline the\r\nmethods used to determine whether a particular basalt\r\nis likely to contain direct information about its source\r\nregion by application of the methods of experimental\r\npetrology. In addition, the experimental work on terrestrial,\r\nlunar, and meteoritic basalts, as well as likely\r\nsource materials, will be reviewed to show the extent to\r\nwhich the link between the basalts and their source\r\nregions has been established, and to show the extent to\r\nwhich additional processes are responsible for the\r\nchemistry observed in the basalts. We will conclude that\r\nexperimental petrology does provide an internally consistent\r\nframework for understanding basalts as the melting\r\nproducts of ultrabasic mantle assemblages, and that\r\nlaboratory experiments can be used for the exercise of\r\ngoing back from basalt chemistry to source region constitution,\r\nprovided that certain conditions are satisfied.",

  "title" : "Systems biology and cancer, [Editorial]",
  "description" : "The systems approach to complex biological problems has rapidly gained ground during the first decade of this century. There are several reasons for this development. An important one is that while the achievement of sequencing the complete human genome, and those of other species, has been of great benefit to fundamental science, for example in comparative genomics and evolutionary biology, it has not led to the expected quick and simple solutions to multifactorial diseases (2010). On the contrary, cancer, cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic and nervous diseases have all been resistant to reductionist analysis. In the case of cancer the hope that by identifying what are called oncogenes we would not only understand cancer but be led naturally to its cure has not been fulfilled ([Sonnenschein and Soto, 1999] and [Sonnenschein and Soto, 2011]). In all areas of medical science, despite the identification of hundreds more potential targets by genome sequencing, the pharmaceutical industry has been faced with a decline in the production of new successful drugs. The more we find out about the fundamental elements of biology, the DNA, RNAs, proteins, metabolites, membrane systems, organelles, the more puzzling the picture becomes. Even central biological concepts, like that of a gene, have changed and have even become difficult to define (Beurton et al., 2008 In: P.J. Beurton, R. Falk and H.-J. Rheinberger, Editors, The Concept of the Gene in Development and Evolution: Historical and Epistemological Perspectives, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge (2008).Beurton et al., 2008).\r\n\r\nReassessment of the fundamental concepts of biological science is therefore necessary. This is happening in all fields, including genetics (Beurton et al., 2008), evolution ([Pigliucci and Müller, 2010], [Gissis and Jablonka, 2011] and [Shapiro, 2011]), cancer (Soto et al., 2008), development and the relationships between genomes and phenotypes ([Noble, 2011b] and [Noble, 2011a]). What once were heresies seem to be creeping back into mainstream biology.\r\n\r\nOne of the driving forces of this development is the use of mathematical modelling in systems biology. This has brought a rigorous quantitative approach to what otherwise would be largely untestable theories. Mathematical models provide a framework in which to interpret the vast amount of experimental data generated on a daily basis and to suggest subsequent experiments necessary to test theories. The traditional verbal reasoning approach is not appropriate in many cases due to the complexity of biology (Gatenby and Maini, 2003) which renders intuition insufficient as results are often counter-intuitive, a characteristic outcome of scientific research that goes as far back as Copernicus’ proposal of an heliocentric planetary system. This vast complexity requires a mathematical approach.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this focussed issue of the journal is that the field of cancer is ripe for the systems biology approach. As editors we have collected an eclectic mix of articles. This is not a ‘one view fits all’ approach. It is rather one to ‘let a hundred flowers bloom’. At this stage in our understanding we cannot be sure where the next big insights are going to come from.\r\n\r\nSince the 18th century biologists and philosophers tried to define the place of biology1 in science and in particular its relationship with physics. A two hundred year debate followed, with biologists adopting “physicalist” or “vitalistic” stands. Was life to be explained in a totally materialistic way by the laws of physics? Or were there additional “forces” present in the living matter but absent in the inert one? Curiously, as vitalism dwindled among biologists in the 20th century, physicists like Schrödinger (1944) and Elsasser (1987) were the ones that tried to understand biological order and were prepared to find new laws that applied only to living matter.2 No new laws resulted from this search, but from the emerging field of information theories, biologists adopted information as the metaphor for the study of biological organization.3 This, however, has not produced the desired effects either, probably because the attempts to formalize this approach failed, which in turn suggests that it was conceptually wrong. Can biology achieve formalization through mathematics, a feat that physics has accomplished so successfully?\r\n\r\nThe article by Giuseppe Longo and Mael Montevil (2011) (mathematicians), analyzes the principles of intelligibility in physics, which is based on symmetries, and posit that the role of symmetries in biology is different: in their words “the permanent change of symmetries …per se modifies the analysis of the internal and external processes of life, both in ontogenesis and evolution”. They propose to consider the roles played by local and global symmetry changes, along extended critical transitions. According to them, the mathematization of this state of extended criticality may provide the adequate frame to understand biological complexity. Paul-Antoine Miquel (2011) (a philosopher), reflects on the philosophical aspects of the theoretical analysis by Longo and Montevil and concludes that “the philosophical key point for us is that they (Longo and Montevil) interpret this mathematical space in which anti-entropy is realized in biological criticality as an extension of the classical physical theoretical frameworks.” These two contributions aim at improving our understanding on why the principles governing living organisms are different from those defining the physicality of inanimate objects and provide a conceptual frame of reference and a point of departure for constructing a mathematics for biology.\r\n\r\nStuart Baker (a bio-statistician) and Barnett Kramer (a cancer epidemiologist) (2011) evaluate the potential contributions of different approaches to Systems Biology when applied to uncover buried messages in the genesis of cancer which may set new trends in research and in ways to benefit patients. They anticipate both promises and perils in applying systems biology to cancer. The great promise of systems biology comes from the idea that studying a system can provide information not available by separately studying the workings of each part. However, they perceive a divide between systems biology based on the principles of biology or biophysics, systems biology related to statistics, bioinformatics, and reverse engineering, and systems biology involving clinical predictions, sometimes without full appreciation of other viewpoints. The peril comes when the rules leading to a complex system vary over many components and the sample sizes are limited for identifying the rules and making predictions. Baker et al. have introduced the concept of “paradigm instability” when referring to current state of affairs through which the field of cancer research is traversing. Thus, they focus on a number of paradoxes that exist in this field and cautiously point at ways that might increase knowledge about the disease and also benefit patients.\r\n\r\nSimon Rosenfeld (2011) (a mathematical physicist) makes a critical analysis of the assumptions and concepts used in the emerging field of network biology, particularly those on the actual physics and chemistry happening inside cells. He posits that, in biology there is dual causality, that is, in addition to the constraints imposed by the laws of nature, there is the evolutionary history of the organism: “…inherent dynamical instability represents the natural laws and physico-chemical principles whereas biological robustness is the result of evolutionary history in which this dynamical instability has been effectively used for gaining evolutionary advantages and survival.” He subscribes to the notion that “Mathematics represents a systematic and orderly way of describing and organizing knowledge. In the majority of scientific disciplines, mathematical reasoning has proven to be an unparalleled and indispensable tool for understanding complex dynamics.” He forcefully argues for adopting a Systems Biology approach to resolve complex biological problems while complying with a comprehensive evolutionary perspective.\r\n\r\nPlankar et al. (2011) challenge the genetically determined paradigm of cancer from another angle to characterise cancer as the result of impaired coherence leading to progressive destabilisation of molecular and gene regulatory networks. As they write in their conclusion “It is becoming clear that even with potentially unlimited insight into the dynamics of genetic changes, cancer could not be sufficiently explained, and neither could it be explained in terms of separate linear molecular pathways alone. During the last decade, scientific attention has turned dramatically towards the metabolic, bioenergetic, developmental, and systems biology aspects of cancer, reflecting a gradual paradigm shift towards its non-genetic origin.”\r\n\r\nEnderling and Hahnfeldt (2011) analyse the dynamics of a growing solid tumour composed of cancer stem cells and cancer non-stem cells using a simple hybrid cellular automaton (CA) model. They illustrate the counter-intuitive finding that increasing the rate of apoptosis, while obviously reducing tumour size in the short-term, actually enhances growth in the long-term. They show that tumours can remain dormant for a long time but stimulation of apoptosis can cause the tumour cell population to aggressively invade. Their work suggests that the widely regarded “evading cell death” as a hallmark of cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000) needs to be revisited.\r\n\r\nKim et al. (2011) begin by reviewing the interactions between a tumour and its microenvironment, highlighting how this plays an important role in the transition from benign or pre-malignant tumour to invasive cancer. They then describe a continuum model for the mechanics of a growing tumour in three spatial dimensions, and use it to investigate the effects on tumour growth of agarose gel inhomogeneities and other microenvironmental factors. This framework is extended to explore ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in which the stroma is modelled as a continuum but the cells of the tumour are modelled discretely. The mechanical model is coupled to the biochemistry via a system of reaction–diffusion equations which describe the dynamics of key signalling factors. This multiscale model is solved numerically and effects of perturbing the system mechanically or biochemically are illustrated. This approach allows us to begin to understand the outcome of the nonlinear interactions of some of the fundamental processes involved in tumour growth, with the potential to then consider methods to control growth and spread.\r\n\r\nGerlee and Anderson (2011) focus on mechanisms present in organisms that allow it, or parts of it, to maintain a given shape or architecture (structural homeostasis). They consider a hybrid CA model for a two-dimensional mono-layer of cells which may, for example, approximate the epithelial lining of an organ. In their model, each cell has an intracellular network which integrates the cues a cell receives from its microenvironment (for example nutrients or growth factors, whose dynamics are modelled by reaction-diffusion equations) and other cells and determines the response of the cell, in terms of its behaviour or phenotype. The problem is then reduced to finding a set of network parameters (or genotype) which maximises a fitness function such that structural homeostatis is attained. Perturbations of the system, such as wounding or mutation, are investigated.\r\n\r\nVera et al. (2011) present an in-depth review which focuses on JAK-STAT (Janus kinase – signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway in the context of cancer. This pathway plays a fundamental role in growth control, cell differentiation and maintenance of tissue homeostasis, and its dysregulation plays an important role in tumourigenesis. They review the biology of the pathway and then survey systems biology approaches that have helped elucidate the dynamics of the pathway under physiological and diseased states.\r\n\r\nScianna et al., (2011) address the multiple levels of organisation involved in vascularisation, an important step enabling tumour growth and the formation of metastases. Their work forms an innovative multiscale hybrid framework within which to test potential anti-angiogenic strategies in treating cancer.\r\n\r\nInsuk Lee (2011) presents a holistic model of genes as a collaborative society. To the standard approaches involving protein–protein interaction networks (PPIN) and transcriptional regulatory networks (TRN) he adds the probabilistic functional gene network (PFGN) to show how robustness can arise despite noisy genomics data. Mapping epistatic interactions between genes is identified as the key way to understanding the genetic organisation of complex traits. Amongst the applications of this approach he considers epistatic interactions between hub cancer genes such as p53.\r\n\r\nKeith Baverstock (2011) uses models of cell regulation to address the important question of whether regulatory networks are hard wired into the genome or whether they are better represented as open systems involving an attractor interacting with the environment. In the latter case, environmental stress can trigger inherited transitions in the phenotype without necessarily involving DNA sequence changes. The second type of model works best. As he says “the power of the model lies in its ability to make evident how it is that a rigid and highly conserved coding sequence in DNA, the genotype, can give rise to phenotypic plasticity and responsiveness to environment” and that it helps to understand “the origins of non-genetic somatic and inherited disease, arising from switches to variant attractors representing phenotypes with abnormal characteristics.” The relevance to diseases like cancer is obvious.\r\n\r\nTaken as a whole, this set of articles not only challenges some of the current paradigms, but also lays the groundwork for alternative approaches and in many cases takes those approaches further towards the goal of understanding cancer as a systems-level process.",
  "texts" : [ "Systems biology and cancer, [Editorial]", "The systems approach to complex biological problems has rapidly gained ground during the first decade of this century. There are several reasons for this development. An important one is that while the achievement of sequencing the complete human genome, and those of other species, has been of great benefit to fundamental science, for example in comparative genomics and evolutionary biology, it has not led to the expected quick and simple solutions to multifactorial diseases (2010). On the contrary, cancer, cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic and nervous diseases have all been resistant to reductionist analysis. In the case of cancer the hope that by identifying what are called oncogenes we would not only understand cancer but be led naturally to its cure has not been fulfilled ([Sonnenschein and Soto, 1999] and [Sonnenschein and Soto, 2011]). In all areas of medical science, despite the identification of hundreds more potential targets by genome sequencing, the pharmaceutical industry has been faced with a decline in the production of new successful drugs. The more we find out about the fundamental elements of biology, the DNA, RNAs, proteins, metabolites, membrane systems, organelles, the more puzzling the picture becomes. Even central biological concepts, like that of a gene, have changed and have even become difficult to define (Beurton et al., 2008 In: P.J. Beurton, R. Falk and H.-J. Rheinberger, Editors, The Concept of the Gene in Development and Evolution: Historical and Epistemological Perspectives, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge (2008).Beurton et al., 2008).\r\n\r\nReassessment of the fundamental concepts of biological science is therefore necessary. This is happening in all fields, including genetics (Beurton et al., 2008), evolution ([Pigliucci and Müller, 2010], [Gissis and Jablonka, 2011] and [Shapiro, 2011]), cancer (Soto et al., 2008), development and the relationships between genomes and phenotypes ([Noble, 2011b] and [Noble, 2011a]). What once were heresies seem to be creeping back into mainstream biology.\r\n\r\nOne of the driving forces of this development is the use of mathematical modelling in systems biology. This has brought a rigorous quantitative approach to what otherwise would be largely untestable theories. Mathematical models provide a framework in which to interpret the vast amount of experimental data generated on a daily basis and to suggest subsequent experiments necessary to test theories. The traditional verbal reasoning approach is not appropriate in many cases due to the complexity of biology (Gatenby and Maini, 2003) which renders intuition insufficient as results are often counter-intuitive, a characteristic outcome of scientific research that goes as far back as Copernicus’ proposal of an heliocentric planetary system. This vast complexity requires a mathematical approach.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this focussed issue of the journal is that the field of cancer is ripe for the systems biology approach. As editors we have collected an eclectic mix of articles. This is not a ‘one view fits all’ approach. It is rather one to ‘let a hundred flowers bloom’. At this stage in our understanding we cannot be sure where the next big insights are going to come from.\r\n\r\nSince the 18th century biologists and philosophers tried to define the place of biology1 in science and in particular its relationship with physics. A two hundred year debate followed, with biologists adopting “physicalist” or “vitalistic” stands. Was life to be explained in a totally materialistic way by the laws of physics? Or were there additional “forces” present in the living matter but absent in the inert one? Curiously, as vitalism dwindled among biologists in the 20th century, physicists like Schrödinger (1944) and Elsasser (1987) were the ones that tried to understand biological order and were prepared to find new laws that applied only to living matter.2 No new laws resulted from this search, but from the emerging field of information theories, biologists adopted information as the metaphor for the study of biological organization.3 This, however, has not produced the desired effects either, probably because the attempts to formalize this approach failed, which in turn suggests that it was conceptually wrong. Can biology achieve formalization through mathematics, a feat that physics has accomplished so successfully?\r\n\r\nThe article by Giuseppe Longo and Mael Montevil (2011) (mathematicians), analyzes the principles of intelligibility in physics, which is based on symmetries, and posit that the role of symmetries in biology is different: in their words “the permanent change of symmetries …per se modifies the analysis of the internal and external processes of life, both in ontogenesis and evolution”. They propose to consider the roles played by local and global symmetry changes, along extended critical transitions. According to them, the mathematization of this state of extended criticality may provide the adequate frame to understand biological complexity. Paul-Antoine Miquel (2011) (a philosopher), reflects on the philosophical aspects of the theoretical analysis by Longo and Montevil and concludes that “the philosophical key point for us is that they (Longo and Montevil) interpret this mathematical space in which anti-entropy is realized in biological criticality as an extension of the classical physical theoretical frameworks.” These two contributions aim at improving our understanding on why the principles governing living organisms are different from those defining the physicality of inanimate objects and provide a conceptual frame of reference and a point of departure for constructing a mathematics for biology.\r\n\r\nStuart Baker (a bio-statistician) and Barnett Kramer (a cancer epidemiologist) (2011) evaluate the potential contributions of different approaches to Systems Biology when applied to uncover buried messages in the genesis of cancer which may set new trends in research and in ways to benefit patients.

  "title" : "GEOCHEMICAL AND ISOTOPIC CONSTRAINTS ON HIMU MAGMATISM: EVIDENCE FROM MOUNT CAMEROON AND MOUNT ETINDE (CAMEROON, WEST AFRICA)",
  "description" : "Mount Cameroon and Mount Etinde volcanoes are located at the passive continental margin of the West African coast. They are interpreted to represent the transition of volcanism from the oceanic to the continental part of the 1600 km volcanic province known as the Cameroon Volcanic Line (CVL). This study is aimed at constraining the source of the HIMU or µ (where µ = 238U/204Pb) feature in these volcanoes and in evaluating their geochemical and isotopic evolution from prehistoric activities to recent. Mount Cameroon and Mount Etinde volcanoes have been chosen for investigation because unlike the classical HIMU volcanoes, which are located on oceanic crust, these volcanoes cut the Sub-Continental Lithospheric Mantle (SCLM) but still possess the chemical and isotopic signatures that characterize HIMU lavas. It is geodynamically significant that none of the other volcanoes that define the continental part of the (CVL) appears to be HIMU in character. Mount Cameroon and Etinde thus, provide a natural laboratory in which to assess the transition from none-HIMU magmatism on continental crust, to HIMU magmatism on oceanic crust, with the potentials of contributing to the understanding of HIMU magmatism in the entire CVL belt. To arrive at this objective, samples collected from both the modern (1959, 1982, 1999 and 2000) and prehistoric flows of Mount Cameroon, including samples obtained from the flanks of Mount Etinde are being investigated. In this regard, mineral chemistry, major/trace element, including 208Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, 206Pb/204Pb, 87Sr/86Sr and 143Nd/144Nd isotopic data for these samples are being reported. Major element chemistry shows that Mount Cameroon lavas are nepheline-normative with MgO contents ranging from 4-9 wt% and SiO2 from 43-48 wt%, which classify as silica undersaturated, mafic alkaline tephri-basanites. Chondrite normalized Rare Earth Element (REE) arrays show extremely tight abundance ranges with no possibility of distinguishing between the different eruptive episodes. They exhibit enrichment in the light REE (LREE). The absence of Eu anomalies indicates the minimal role of plagioclase fractionation in the evolution of the lavas. Compatible trace elements versus MgO relationships show trends which indicate evolution through the fractional crystallization of olivine, clinopyroxene and Cr-spinel. With the exception of a few Mount Cameroon lavas, which show more primitive compositions (for example Ni &gt; 145 ppm, Cr &gt; 400 ppm and Mg# &gt; 57) suggesting possible equilibrium with lower mantle mineralogy, the remaining lavas show significant degrees of fractionation, shown by Mg# ranging between 45 and 51, Ni=29-87ppm and Cr=28-144 ppm, indicative of lower pressure fractional crystallization. Olivine compositions in Mount Cameroon lavas vary from Fo59-87 with predominant composition between Fo78-87. For Mount Etinde volcano, the majority of samples have Ni = 4-95 ppm and Cr = 0.4-257 ppm and only few samples show trends of typical primitive mantle liquids; Ni = 120-140 ppm and Cr = 258-381 ppm. Olivine compositions range from Fo65-87. However, a presumed parental sample in Etinde has Fo66-87. Canonical trace element ratios ratios for both volcanoes e.g. Nb/U (46-48), Nb/Th (12-14) and chondritic Nb/Ta values (16.9-17.6), rule out the possibility of significant melt/crust interactions. Although the modern and prehistoric flows of Mount Cameroon are geochemically variable, they are isotopically homogeneous, indicative of a common mantle source, which has remained unchanged for &gt; 10 Ma. Geochemical differences in these lavas must therefore represent the effects of variable degrees of partial melting and crystal fractionation. By contrast, isotopic variations and trace element systematics suggest a relatively heterogeneous mantle source and or high degree of fractionation for Etinde lavas leading to the occurrence of basalts and differentiated nephelintes. Pb-Sr-Nd isotope compositions show the following ranges for Mount Cameroon lavas: 206Pb/204Pb=20.19-20.46, 207Pb/204Pb=15.63-15.69, 208Pb/204Pb=40.02-40.30, 87Sr/86Sr=0.70322-0.70335 (-21.37 to -19.47) and 143Nd/144Nd=0.51276-0.51284 (PNd = +2 to +4). Mount Etinde lavas are characterised by 206Pb/204Pb=20.16-20.55, 207Pb/204Pb=15.64-15.68, 208Pb/204Pb=40.04-40.32, 87Sr/86Sr=0.70324-0.70348 (PSr = - 21.04 to -17.63) and 143Nd/144Nd=0.51273-0.5129 (PNd = +1.77 to +5.19). The results show that Etinde lavas not only cover the entire range of Mount Cameroon isotopic compositions but extends towards more radiogenic Pb and Nd compositions (PNd = +1.77 to +5.19). The wide range in PNd in Etinde melts reflects the influence of a heterogeneous source with variation in Sm/Nd or that the lavas entrained DMM (asthenospheric) signature during ascent. The restricted range of PNd in Mt Cameroon lavas suggests that the mantle source is OIB-like, possibly the lower mantle and that these lavas ascended without significant entrainment of DMM material. The overall isotopic compositions indicate that lavas from both volcanoes are derived from the mantle reservoir known as HIMU, suggestive of high time-integrated Pb enrichment resulting from U+Th/Pb fractionation. The HIMU signature for both Mount Cameroon and Etinde has previously been attributed to the influence of the St. Helena plume. The results of this study however suggest that although St. Helena is also HIMU in character, it is geochemically distinct from the Cameroon Line volcanoes. A new model is therefore proposed suggesting that the HIMU feature in both Mounts Cameroon and Etinde lavas is supplied by lower mantle upwellings that have been seismically imaged beneath the Atlantic, extending through the Mount Cameroon region to the East African Rift System.",

Mount Etinde lavas are characterised by 206Pb/204Pb=20.16-20.55, 207Pb/204Pb=15.64-15.68, 208Pb/204Pb=40.04-40.32, 87Sr/86Sr=0.70324-0.70348 (PSr = - 21.04 to -17.63) and 143Nd/144Nd=0.51273-0.5129 (PNd = +1.77 to +5.19). The results show that Etinde lavas not only cover the entire range of Mount Cameroon isotopic compositions but extends towards more radiogenic Pb and Nd compositions (PNd = +1.77 to +5.19). The wide range in PNd in Etinde melts reflects the influence of a heterogeneous source with variation in Sm/Nd or that the lavas entrained DMM (asthenospheric) signature during ascent. The restricted range of PNd in Mt Cameroon lavas suggests that the mantle source is OIB-like, possibly the lower mantle and that these lavas ascended without significant entrainment of DMM material. The overall isotopic compositions indicate that lavas from both volcanoes are derived from the mantle reservoir known as HIMU, suggestive of high time-integrated Pb enrichment resulting from U+Th/Pb fractionation. The HIMU signature for both Mount Cameroon and Etinde has previously been attributed to the influence of the St. Helena plume. The results of this study however suggest that although St. Helena is also HIMU in character, it is geochemically distinct from the Cameroon Line volcanoes. A new model is therefore proposed suggesting that the HIMU feature in both Mounts Cameroon and Etinde lavas is supplied by lower mantle upwellings that have been seismically imaged beneath the Atlantic, extending through the Mount Cameroon region to the East African Rift System.", null ],

Subtractive proteomics was used to distinguish contaminants from true vacuolar proteins by comparing the relative abundances of proteins in pure and crude preparations. A robust statistical analysis combining enrichment ranking with the double boundary iterative group analysis revealed that 148 proteins were significantly enriched in the pure vacuolar preparations.

Although the majority of contaminating proteins from other organelles were depleted from the pure vacuolar membranes, some proteins annotated to reside in other cellular locations were enriched along with the vacuolar proteins.

  "title" : "20.On the Volcanism of the Huzi Volcanic Zone, with Special Reference to the Geology and Petrology of Idu and the Southern Islands.",
  "description" : "When volcanic activity began in the region studied is a matter of conjecture. There is no doubt, however, that volcanoes were already in existence in Eocene times, seeing that the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands are composed almost exclusively of andesitic rocks, both explosive and effusive, with a few intercalated Eocene limestones. If these islands were located on the submarine ridge that underlies the insular volcanoes of the Huzi volcanic zone, it would be more than likely that the Ogasawara volcanics are products of the earliest recognized forerunner of volcanic activity in that zone, but their more or less outlying position seem to militate against this view. However, notwithstanding the lack of positive evidence indicating structural similarity, the writer presents the above view as a possible explanation, because the Ogasawara andesites show the same general characteristics, both microscopical and chemical, as the allied rocks from the Huzi volcanic zone. The first indisputable record of volcanic activity in the Huzi volcanic zone dates to early Miocene. This seems to be the case not only with the Idu region, in the study of which the writer is chiefly concerned, but also with the much larger region of the \"fossa magna\", of which Idu forms but a small part. Through the whole of the period that succeeded it, the same general sequence of volcanic activity has beeu maintained in most parts of the fossa magna with certain local differences. It is therefore highly probable that, although local volcanic activity had already manifested itself in Eocene times in the Ogasawara Islands, more active and more regional activity had started contemporaneously with the tectonic disturbances, the result of all which is the fossa magna, which severed the geologic continuation between southwestern and northeastern Japan. As to whether or not the Ogasawara Islands were subjected to the same disturbances, the writer is unable to say. The lower Miocene volcanism in Idu, which occurred beneath the sea of that time, is represented by a thick series of highly altered volcanics (lavas and pyroclastics), referred to as the Yugasima beds (or the propylite series). This series consists for the most part of basaltic and andesitic rocks, although dacites and liparites are also represented, especially in the upper horizons of the series. The succession of these rocks implies considerable time, during which certain structural deformations might possibly have recurred, resulting in several periods of volcanic accumulation. But its actual duration is a question we have no means of answering at present, the only precise datum being the faunal evidence (Lepidocyclina limestone from Simo-Siroiwra and Miogypsina limestone from Nasimoto), which assigns certain dacitic volcanics lying some distance above the base of the series to lower Miocene. The propylite series is invaded by numerous minor intrusives (dikes, sheets, and necks) of various rock-types―diabase, porphyrite, basalt, andesite, dacite, and liparite (quartz-porphyry). Although these intrusives are evidently later than the propylite series, not all of them were formed contemporaneously. The basic intrusives (including diabase, porphyrite, basalt, and andesite) are mostly older, all being altered in the same way as the propylite series in which they are found, whereas the more acid intrusives are mostly somewhat younger, being probably correlated with the acid volcanics that overlie unconformably the propylite series. The lower Miocene volcanism was followed, probably during upper Miocene, by submarine eruptions of liparites and dacites, with subordinate andesites, all of'which are distributed mostly in south Idu and rather locally in north Idu. As just mentioned, some of the minor intrusives in the propylite series, especially those of acid rocks, might be the feeders of the upper Miocene volcanics. In contrast with the propylite series, these upper Miocene volcanics are either quite fresh or are but little altered. The foregoing phase of volcanism was succeeded, most probably during lower Pliocene, by a subordinate phase of activity characterized by minor intrusions (dikes) and extrusions of andesites. Regarding volcanism during this period, however, we are largely in the dark as only a few rocks in Idu have been identified with that period. In the uppermost Pliocene, eruptions of basalts, dacites, and andesites, occurred only locally in Idu, and these were again exclusively submarine. At the  close  of the Tertiary or the beginning of the Pleistocene, Idu peninsula was subjected like the other regions in the fossa magma to crustal movement, generally in the sense of uplift, and it was not until some time after this movement, which raised so much of the Tertiary sea-floor into land, that Pleistocene volcanism became vigorous. This volcanism was concentrated mainly in the northern part of the peninsula, while in the southern part, Tertiary volcanism was succeeded by that relative quiescence which marked the Pleistocene aud Recent epochs. The first phase of lower Pleistocene volcanism is thus represented by eruptions of basalts, andesites, and dacites, all occurring in the forms of tuff and tuff-breccia that now occupy the bulk of the lacustrine deposits (Ono beds, Simo-Hata beds, and Simo-Tanna beds) accumulated during that period on the erosion reliefs of the Tertiary formations. It was followed at the end of lower Pleistocene and in the upper Pleistocene, when the lower Pleistocene deposits had been more or less deformed, by eruptions of central volcanoes. The volcanoes Tensi, Usami, Taga, Yugawara, Asitaka, Amagi, Hakone, and others in the northwestern part of the Idu peninsula yet unstudied, as also the dacitic masses in the vicinity of Atami, are ^ all products of this phase of activity, with however certain differences in the times when the activities began and in the period for which they lasted. The basaltic- Omuro-yama group represents the last volcanism in the peninsula, which probably occurred some time later when the older volcanoes Tensi, Usami, Taga, etc., were subjected to more or less dislocation and dissection ; while the numerous hot-springs there represent a stage of post-volcanic thermal activity. So far as its visible part is concerned, Huzi may date from a much later age, probably Recent. That one of the earliest lava-flows from the volcano is younger than the older somma of Hakone has been definitely proved by field evidence. All the insular volcanoes of the Seven Idu Islands and the Southern Islands are undoubtedly products of Quaternary volcanism, whatever may be the history of their foundation. Of these, the dissected basaltic volcanoes Utone-sima, To-sima, Mikura-sima, Higasi-yama (Hatizyo-sima), Tori-sima, and Kita lo-sima probably date to Pleistocene. With the exception of Tori-sima111), we have no record of eruption of any of them. The basaltic volcanoes 0-sima, Miyake-sima, Nisi-yama (Hatizyo-sima), and Aoga-sima have been active in Recent times, all displaying lava out-flows in historic times. The liparitic volcanoes Nii-sima and Kodu-sima, according to records, also have had one eruption each. With the exception of the rarer alkaline rocks (potash-liparite and trachyandesite), the rocks that erupted in the course of the volcanism just outlined above have all several characteristics in common, mineralogical as well as chemical, with however certain differences due to local peculiarities. Whether chemically or mineralogically, there seems to be no systematic difference between the Tertiary and Quaternary series, excepting that the former usually has a higher water-content than the latter. A petropraphic similarity in the Ogasawara rocks to allied rocks from Idu is quite apparent. Of the various rock-types represented, the basalts and basaltic andesites are most predominant besides being regional in distribution, while the others are rather local. These regional rock-types are usually characterized by phenocrysts of calcic plagioclase (anorthite to calcic labradorite) and pyroxenes (augite or hypersthene or both), with or without olivine, in a groundmass containing less calcic plagioclase (bytownite to sodic labradorite), pigeonite, magnetite, and one or more of silica minerals (cristobalite, tridymite, and quartz). It is notable that most of the young lavas from Miyake-sima, Hatizyo-sima, Aoga-sima, etc., are poor in phenocrysts or almost aphyric, while the old lavas from these volcanoes are sometimes strongly porphyritic with large phenocrysts of anorthite. Like the latter, most of the lavas from the Pleistocene basaltic volcanoes (Kita lo-sima, Tori-sima, Mikura-sima, etc.), as also the basalts in the Tertiary series, are strongly porphyritic, sometimes with large phenocrysts of anorthite, the less porphyritic or almost-aphyric rocks being rarely met with. The variation diagram of the aphyric and aphanitic rocks (magma variation diagram) from both the Tertiary series and the Quaternary volcanoes shows smooth curves for all oxides, showing the probable variations in the magmatic liquids from which most of the volcanic rocks of the present region seem to have been derived. The variation diagram of type-averages of the Tertiary porphyritic rocks is identical with the same diagram of the Quaternary porphyritic rocks. The two are again similar to the variation diagram of the well-differentiated rocks of one volcano, namely, Amagi, with the result that either of these two diagrams will represent the chemical variation for rocks of the entire region. The variation on the whole follows that of type-averages of the Japanese volcanic rocks, thus showing the common characteristics that distinguish them from corresponding type-averages of the world's igneous rocks: namely, in containing higher lime, lower alkalies, and larger ratios of iron-oxides to magnesia. But, as compared. with type-averages of the Japanese volcanic rocks, the corresponding type-averages of the present region are usually a little higher in soda but lower in potash. So also do the latter as compared with the rocks from the two other volcanic zones in Japan, namely, the medial volcanic zone of NE. Japan and the Ryukyu volcanic zone. The rocks of the region studied, except a few alkaline rocks, may be treated as a connected suite, all belonging to what Peacock calls the \"calcic series\", with high alkali-lime index, 62・5 for the Tertiary series and 65・7 for the Quaternary series. If the entire suite has originated from a common magma, we would have to admit that acid rocks such as liparites were derived by processes of differentiation from a basaltic magma. During the whole period since the Tertiary, however, volcanism in the present region has been alternately basaltic (or andesitic) and liparitic (or dacitic). This recurrence of similar rock-types points to one of two explanations : (1) either a body of acid magna that had separated out during early Tertiary or before it had remained throughout succeeding ages as an available source of the acid rocks that erupted during several distinct epochs, or (2) that differentiation to an advanced stage had proceeded repeatedly along definite lines at wide intervals of time. Although, of these two alternatives, the former is the more simple, the latter process also must have operated at certain local centres in the region, seeing that well-differentiated rocks intimately related, structurally as well as petrologically, occur in certain central volcanoes such as Amagi. Although the rocks of the so-called Huzi volcanic zone may be treated on the whole as a connected magmatic suite, we find certain differences among them due to local peculiarities, mineralogical as well as chemical. Thus the Huzi rocks differ from the allied rocks of Idu and the Southern Islands in that the former are distinctly higher in alkalies, especially potash, and lower in lime than the latter. So also do the rocks from the volcanoes Kayaga-take and liduna-yama compared with the allied rocks of Idu and the Southern Islands. Although these two volcanoes lie farther north of Huzi, they belong in a wide sense to the Huzi volcanic zone. From these facts in view, the writer believes that the Huzi volcanic zone may be divided petrologically into two subzones, namely, the northern inland zone referred to as the Huzi Volcanic Zone proper, and the southern oceanic zone referred to as the O-sima Volcanic Zone. The Huzi volcanic zone proper includes the inland volcanoes Huzi, Kayaga-take, liduna-yama Kurohime-yama, and many others (Myoko-zan, Yatuga-take volcano group, etc.) yet unstudied, all of which are linearly arranged in a NNW.-SSE. direction on the fossa magna, while the 0-sima volcanic zone includes, in addition to the volcanoes of the Idu peninsula, the insular and submarine volcanoes of the Pacific―the Seven Idu Islands and the Southern Islands. To generalize, although the rocks of the so-called Huzi volcanic zone, with the exception of a feiv alkaline rocks, belong on the whole to a calcic series, the rocks from its northern inland part―the Huzi volcanic zone proper―are higher in alkalies and loiver in lime than those from the southern oceanic part―the O-sima volcanic zone. Whether or not the chemical differences of these two sub-zones are in any way connected with some differences in the geotectonic structure and in the nature of rocks of their foundation is a question we have no means of answering at present. The O-sima volcanic zone just proposed has two kinds of alkaline rocks, namely, potash-liparite (Manzo-yama and Kodu-sima) and trachyandesite (Io-sima). As to the genesis of the potash-liparite, a possible explanation was offered in an earlier paper112). As to the genesis of the trachyandesite, little can be said with certainty at present except that its local distribution in the Volcano Islands group and the occcurrence in it of porphyritic olivine and augite, both of which are similar in microscopic characters to the respective minerals in the basalts from the same group, make it possible that it is genetically related to these basalts. In this connection the distribution of the sites of volcanic vents in the Volcano Islands group calls for notice. Although the general trend of this group is from NNW. to SSE.―that is, the trend of the so-called Huzi volcanic zone―, lo-sima, besides being elongated in outline from NE. to SW., has numerous solfataras which are aligned on fissures running in the same direction. The trachyandesitic submarine volcano, \"Sin-to Volcano\", also lies on a line running NE.-SW. through the basaltic volcano, Minami lo-sima. Similar relation holds between the basaltic and liparitic volcanoes of the Seven Idu Islands11'0. Therefore, if the sites of volcanic vents were fixed by dislocation or lines of weakness in the earth's crust, these two trends―the NNW.-SSE. trend of the basaltic (or andesitic) volcanoes and the NE.-SW. trend of the liparitic (or dacitic) and trachyandesitic volcanoes―may be a surface manifestation of the underground structure of the region, the former representing a principal fracture (Daly's \"abyssal fissure\")114) connected with deep-seated reservoirs of a regional basaltic magma, and the latter a subsidiary fracture connected with shallow-seated reservoirs of local differentiates, either liparitic or trachyandesitic, from the basaltic magma. In conclusion, a few remarks should be added here regarding the alteration through secondary changes of the Tertiary volcanics in Idu, although on this point the writer has not yet been able to gather much information. As already noted, the only rocks that are altered to any important extent are these of the propylite series and the minor intrusives in that series. The common secondary minerals in them are chlorite, calcite, sericite, epidote, limonite, haematite, pyrite, zeolite, albite, and quartz, with amorphous silica, two or more of these minerals always occurring together. The alteration, however, has not advanced to the same degree and in the same way throughout the series. In some parts of the series, most of the rocks are almost unchanged, although, as a rule, incipient alteration of the constituent minerals is found only to a very slight extent, while in many others the alteration is considerable, resulting in virtual disappearance of the original structure of the rock, whether viewed microscopically or in the field. We often find that complete recrystallization has occurred, showing a mosaic of quartz and feldspar, with occasional flakes of sericite and chlorite. Since the alteration of the propylite series has advanced farther not only at and near the contacts with minor intrusives in the series, but also in the intrusives themselves than at distances away from the contacts, it could only have been caused by local and chemical effects, that, is to say, by chemical reactions between the original rocks of the series and some hydrothermal solutions115'that possibly generated in a post-magmatic stage subsequent to the minor intrusions rather than by regional and dynamic agencies. The metamorphic changes justifying the name, propylite, were probably caused by a sodiferous hydrothermal solution, possibly related to the basic intrusives (diabase, porphyrite, basalt, and andesite). The product of this intense mineralization which is so economically important and which has been worked in several parts of the propylite series in the region, was generated probably by a hydrothermal solution rich in silica generally related to the acid intrusives (dacite and liparite or quartz-porphyry). K. Sugi divided the metamorphism of the Misaka series of the Nakagawa district adjoining the northern part of Hakone, which is intruded by a large quartz-diorite mass, and which is a lower Miocene series correlated with the propylite series of Idu, into two stages: dynamic metamorphism caused by a mountain-building movement generated within a geosynclinal area before the intrusion of the quartz-diorite and contact metamorphism at the time of that intrusion116). The writer is of the opinion that the dynamic metamorphism, if it did occur, must have been due merely to local stresses that generated outside the boundary of the quartz-diorite mass at the beginning of the intrusion of that mass, seeing that the metamorphism is quite local in the Misaka series both at and near the contacts with the intrusive, and that such metamorphism is never met with in the propylite series of Idu, which belongs to the same geotectonic unit as the Misaka series.",
  "texts" : [ "20.On the Volcanism of the Huzi Volcanic Zone, with Special Reference to the Geology and Petrology of Idu and the Southern Islands.", "When volcanic activity began in the region studied is a matter of conjecture. There is no doubt, however, that volcanoes were already in existence in Eocene times, seeing that the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands are composed almost exclusively of andesitic rocks, both explosive and effusive, with a few intercalated Eocene limestones. If these islands were located on the submarine ridge that underlies the insular volcanoes of the Huzi volcanic zone, it would be more than likely that the Ogasawara volcanics are products of the earliest recognized forerunner of volcanic activity in that zone, but their more or less outlying position seem to militate against this view. However, notwithstanding the lack of positive evidence indicating structural similarity, the writer presents the above view as a possible explanation, because the Ogasawara andesites show the same general characteristics, both microscopical and chemical, as the allied rocks from the Huzi volcanic zone. The first indisputable record of volcanic activity in the Huzi volcanic zone dates to early Miocene. This seems to be the case not only with the Idu region, in the study of which the writer is chiefly concerned, but also with the much larger region of the \"fossa magna\", of which Idu forms but a small part. Through the whole of the period that succeeded it, the same general sequence of volcanic activity has beeu maintained in most parts of the fossa magna with certain local differences. It is therefore highly probable that, although local volcanic activity had already manifested itself in Eocene times in the Ogasawara Islands, more active and more regional activity had started contemporaneously with the tectonic disturbances, the result of all which is the fossa magna, which severed the geologic continuation between southwestern and northeastern Japan. As to whether or not the Ogasawara Islands were subjected to the same disturbances, the writer is unable to say. The lower Miocene volcanism in Idu, which occurred beneath the sea of that time, is represented by a thick series of highly altered volcanics (lavas and pyroclastics), referred to as the Yugasima beds (or the propylite series). This series consists for the most part of basaltic and andesitic rocks, although dacites and liparites are also represented, especially in the upper horizons of the series. The succession of these rocks implies considerable time, during which certain structural deformations might possibly have recurred, resulting in several periods of volcanic accumulation. But its actual duration is a question we have no means of answering at present, the only precise datum being the faunal evidence (Lepidocyclina limestone from Simo-Siroiwra and Miogypsina limestone from Nasimoto), which assigns certain dacitic volcanics lying some distance above the base of the series to lower Miocene. The propylite series is invaded by numerous minor intrusives (dikes, sheets, and necks) of various rock-types―diabase, porphyrite, basalt, andesite, dacite, and liparite (quartz-porphyry). Although these intrusives are evidently later than the propylite series, not all of them were formed contemporaneously. The basic intrusives (including diabase, porphyrite, basalt, and andesite) are mostly older, all being altered in the same way as the propylite series in which they are found, whereas the more acid intrusives are mostly somewhat younger, being probably correlated with the acid volcanics that overlie unconformably the propylite series. The lower Miocene volcanism was followed, probably during upper Miocene, by submarine eruptions of liparites and dacites, with subordinate andesites, all of'which are distributed mostly in south Idu and rather locally in north Idu. As just mentioned, some of the minor intrusives in the propylite series, especially those of acid rocks, might be the feeders of the upper Miocene volcanics. In contrast with the propylite series, these upper Miocene volcanics are either quite fresh or are but little altered. The foregoing phase of volcanism was succeeded, most probably during lower Pliocene, by a subordinate phase of activity characterized by minor intrusions (dikes) and extrusions of andesites. Regarding volcanism during this period, however, we are largely in the dark as only a few rocks in Idu have been identified with that period. In the uppermost Pliocene, eruptions of basalts, dacites, and andesites, occurred only locally in Idu, and these were again exclusively submarine. At the  close  of the Tertiary or the beginning of the Pleistocene, Idu peninsula was subjected like the other regions in the fossa magma to crustal movement, generally in the sense of uplift, and it was not until some time after this movement, which raised so much of the Tertiary sea-floor into land, that Pleistocene volcanism became vigorous. This volcanism was concentrated mainly in the northern part of the peninsula, while in the southern part, Tertiary volcanism was succeeded by that relative quiescence which marked the Pleistocene aud Recent epochs. The first phase of lower Pleistocene volcanism is thus represented by eruptions of basalts, andesites, and dacites, all occurring in the forms of tuff and tuff-breccia that now occupy the bulk of the lacustrine deposits (Ono beds, Simo-Hata beds, and Simo-Tanna beds) accumulated during that period on the erosion reliefs of the Tertiary formations. It was followed at the end of lower Pleistocene and in the upper Pleistocene, when the lower Pleistocene deposits had been more or less deformed, by eruptions of central volcanoes. The volcanoes Tensi, Usami, Taga, Yugawara, Asitaka, Amagi, Hakone, and others in the northwestern part of the Idu peninsula yet unstudied, as also the dacitic masses in the vicinity of Atami, are ^ all products of this phase of activity, with however certain differences in the times when the activities began and in the period for which they lasted. The basaltic- Omuro-yama group represents the last volcanism in the peninsula, which probably occurred some time later when the older volcanoes Tensi, Usami, Taga, etc., were subjected to more or less dislocation and dissection ; while the numerous hot-springs there represent a stage of post-volcanic thermal activity. So far as its visible part is concerned, Huzi may date from a much later age, probably Recent. That one of the earliest lava-flows from the volcano is younger than the older somma of Hakone has been definitely proved by field evidence. All the insular volcanoes of the Seven Idu Islands and the Southern Islands are undoubtedly products of Quaternary volcanism, whatever may be the history of their foundation. Of these, the dissected basaltic volcanoes Utone-sima, To-sima, Mikura-sima, Higasi-yama (Hatizyo-sima), Tori-sima, and Kita lo-sima probably date to Pleistocene. With the exception of Tori-sima111), we have no record of eruption of any of them. The basaltic volcanoes 0-sima, Miyake-sima, Nisi-yama (Hatizyo-sima), and Aoga-sima have been active in Recent times, all displaying lava out-flows in historic times. The liparitic volcanoes Nii-sima and Kodu-sima, according to records, also have had one eruption each. With the exception of the rarer alkaline rocks (potash-liparite and trachyandesite), the rocks that erupted in the course of the volcanism just outlined above have all several characteristics in common, mineralogical as well as chemical, with however certain differences due to local peculiarities. Whether chemically or mineralogically, there seems to be no systematic difference between the Tertiary and Quaternary series, excepting that the former usually has a higher water-content than the latter. A petropraphic similarity in the Ogasawara rocks to allied rocks from Idu is quite apparent. Of the various rock-types represented, the basalts and basaltic andesites are most predominant besides being regional in distribution, while the others are rather local. These regional rock-types are usually characterized by phenocrysts of calcic plagioclase (anorthite to calcic labradorite) and pyroxenes (augite or hypersthene or both), with or without olivine, in a groundmass containing less calcic plagioclase (bytownite to sodic labradorite), pigeonite, magnetite, and one or more of silica minerals (cristobalite, tridymite, and quartz). It is notable that most of the young lavas from Miyake-sima, Hatizyo-sima, Aoga-sima, etc., are poor in phenocrysts or almost aphyric, while the old lavas from these volcanoes are sometimes strongly porphyritic with large phenocrysts of anorthite. Like the latter, most of the lavas from the Pleistocene basaltic volcanoes (Kita lo-sima, Tori-sima, Mikura-sima, etc.), as also the basalts in the Tertiary series, are strongly porphyritic, sometimes with large phenocrysts of anorthite, the less porphyritic or almost-aphyric rocks being rarely met with. The variation diagram of the aphyric and aphanitic rocks (magma variation diagram) from both the Tertiary series and the Quaternary volcanoes shows smooth curves for all oxides, showing the probable variations in the magmatic liquids from which most of the volcanic rocks of the present region seem to have been derived. The variation diagram of type-averages of the Tertiary porphyritic rocks is identical with the same diagram of the Quaternary porphyritic rocks. The two are again similar to the variation diagram of the well-differentiated rocks of one volcano, namely, Amagi, with the result that either of these two diagrams will represent the chemical variation for rocks of the entire region. The variation on the whole follows that of type-averages of the Japanese volcanic rocks, thus showing the common characteristics that distinguish them from corresponding type-averages of the world's igneous rocks: namely, in containing higher lime, lower alkalies, and larger ratios of iron-oxides to magnesia.

  "title" : "Ground deformation monitoring of a potential landslide at La Palma, Canary Islands",
  "description" : "The southern part of the island of La Palms comprises a north-south-oriented volcano known as the Cumbre Vieja. The steep gradient and high aspect ratio of the volcano, coupled with the prospect of future episodes of magma intrusion, highlight the potential for large-scale lateral collapse of the volcano, as recorded earlier in the history of La Palma and elsewhere in the Canary Islands. Historic eruptions of the Cumbre Vieja have occurred high up on the western flank of the volcano and along a single rift zone along the crest of the volcano. The geometry Of the recent activity and faulting which occurred during an eruption in 1949 indicates that a discontinuity may be present beneath the western flank of the volcano, along which a future collapse may occur. To identify any displacement of the western flank overlying the discontinuity, a ground deformation network has recently been established on the volcano. The initial network spanned the fault system that developed on the upper flanks of the Cumbre Vieja during the 1949 eruption. This small network was measured in 1994, 1996 and 1997 using infrared Electronic Distance Measurement. In;1997, the network was enlarged and re-occupied, using the Global Positioning System, to incorporate the west flank and the southern pan of the island. Although the results show that apparent displacements recorded during this period are within the error-margins of the techniques employed, the apparent movement vectors do suggest a coherent westward displacement of stations to the west of the 1949 fault system. Additional occupations of the network over the next few years will, however, be required to determine the reality or otherwise of this apparent coherent movement, and thus to decide whether or not the western flank of the Cumbre Vieja is currently sliding seaward. If not, it can be inferred that the volcano is stable during inter-eruptive periods. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved",

We summarize the above results as follows:\\\\proclaim Theorem.For any von Neumann algebra~$M$ and for any complex numbers $a$~and~$b$with a nonnegative real partthe multiplication map $\\\\L_a(M)\\\\otimes_M\\\\L_b(M)\\\\to\\\\L_{a+b}(M)$and the left multiplication map $\\\\L_a(M)\\\\to\\\\Hom_M(\\\\L_b(M),\\\\L_{a+b}(M))$are isometric isomorphisms of (quasi-)Banach $M$-$M$-bimodules.Here $\\\\otimes_M$ denotes the algebraic tensor product (without any kind of completion)and $\\\\Hom_M$ denotes the algebraic inner hom (without any kind of continuity restriction).The second main result of this dissertation is concerned with extension of the aboveresults to {\\\\it $\\\\L_p$-modules}, which were defined by Junge and Sherman in~2005.An $\\\\L_p(M)$-module over a von Neumann algebra~$M$ is an algebraic $M$-moduleequipped with an inner product with values in $\\\\L_{2p}(M)$.A typical example is given by the space $\\\\L_p(M)$ itself with the inner product $(x,y)=x^*y$.The phenomena of automatic completeness and continuity extend to $\\\\L_p$-modules.In particular, if $X$ is an $\\\\L_p(M)$-module, then $X\\\\otimes_M\\\\L_q(M)$is an $\\\\L_q(M)$-module.Similarly, if $Y$ is an $\\\\L_{p+q}(M)$-module, then $\\\\Hom_M(\\\\L_q(M),Y)$ is an $\\\\L_p(M)$-module.Of particular importance are the cases $p=0$ and $p=1/2$.$\\\\L_0(M)$-modules are also known as Hilbert W*-modules.The category of $\\\\L_{1/2}(M)$-modules is equivalent to the category of representationsof~$M$ on Hilbert spaces and the equivalence preserves the underlying algebraic $M$-module.We can summarize these results as follows:\\\\proclaim Theorem.For any von Neumann algebra~$M$ and for any nonnegative real numbers $d$~and~$e$the category of right $\\\\L_d(M)$-modules is equivalentto the category of right $\\\\L_{d+e}(M)$-modules.The equivalences are implemented by the algebraic tensor productand the algebraic inner hom with~$\\\\L_e(M)$.In particular, all categories of right $\\\\L_d(M)$-modules are equivalentto each other and to the category of representations of~$M$ on Hilbert spaces.This theorem can also be extended to bimodules.An $M$-$\\\\L_d(N)$-bimodule is a right $\\\\L_d(N)$-module~$X$equipped with a morphism of von Neumann algebras $M\\\\to\\\\End(X)$.Here $\\\\End(X)$ denotes the space of all continuous $N$-linear endomorphisms of~$X$.An $\\\\L_d(M)$-$N$-bimodule is defined similarly.In particular, the category of $M$-$\\\\L_{1/2}(N)$-bimodules is equivalentto the category of commuting representations (birepresentations) of $M$~and~$N$ on Hilbert spaces.The latter category is also equivalent to the category of $\\\\L_{1/2}(M)$-$N$-bimodules.These equivalences preserve the underlying algebraic $M$-$N$-bimodules,in particular, every $M$-$\\\\L_{1/2}(N)$-bimodule is also an $\\\\L_{1/2}(M)$-$N$-bimodule.\\\\proclaim Theorem.The categories of $\\\\L_d(M)$-$N$-bimodules, $M$-$\\\\L_d(N)$-bimodules,and commuting representations of $M$~and~$N$ on Hilbert spacesare all equivalent to each other.The equivalences for different values of~$d$ are implemented as usualby the algebraic tensor product and the algebraic inner hom with the relevant space~$\\\\L_e(M)$.The equivalence between $\\\\L_d(M)$-$N$-bimodules and $M$-$\\\\L_d(N)$-bimodulesis implemented by passing from an $\\\\L_d(M)$-$N$-bimoduleto an $\\\\L_{1/2}(M)$-$N$-bimodule, then reinterpreting the latter moduleas an $M$-$N$-birepresentation,then passing to an $M$-$\\\\L_{1/2}(N)$-bimodule, and finally passing to an $M$-$\\\\L_d(N)$-bimodule.(A weaker form of this result relating $\\\\L_0$-bimodulesand birepresentations was proved earlier by Baillet, Denizeau, and Havet,who used the completed tensor product and the continuous inner hom.)Note that passing from $\\\\L_d(M)$-$N$-bimodule to $M$-$\\\\L_d(N)$-bimodule can completelychange the underlying algebraic bimodule structure.For example, take $d=0$, $M=\\\\C$ (the field of complex numbers)and $N=B(H)$ for some Hilbert space~$H$.Then $B(H)$ is a $\\\\C$-$\\\\L_0(B(H))$-bimodule.The corresponding $\\\\L_0(\\\\C)$-$B(H)$-bimodule is $\\\\L_{1/2}(B(H))$(the space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators on~$H$), which is completely different from~$B(H)$.The above equivalences allow us to pass freely between different categories,choosing whatever category is the most convenient for the current problem.For example, Connes fusion can be most easily defined for $M$-$\\\\L_0(N)$-bimodules,where it is simply the completed tensor product.In fact, the easiest way to define the ``classical'' Connes fusion(Connes fusion of birepresentations) is to pass from birepresentations of $M$~and~$N$to $M$-$\\\\L_{1/2}(N)$-modules, then to $M$-$\\\\L_0(N)$-modules,then compute the completed tensor product, and then pass back to birepresentations.One of the reasons for studying $\\\\L_d$-bimodules is that they form a targetcategory for $2|1$-dimensional Euclidean field theories,which conjecturally describe the cohomology theory known as TMF (topological modular forms).More precisely, a Euclidean field theory is a 2-functor from a certain2-category of $2|1$-dimensional Euclidean bordisms to some algebraic 2-category,which in this case should consist of algebras, bimodules, and intertwiners of some sort.Thus we are naturally forced to organizevon Neumann algebras, right $\\\\L_d$-bimodules, and their morphismsinto some sort of a 2-category (more precisely, a framed double category):\\\\proclaim Theorem.There is a framed double category whose category of objects is the categoryof von Neumann algebras and their isomorphismsand the category of morphisms is the category of right $\\\\L_d$-bimodules (for all values of~$d$)and their morphisms.The composition of morphisms is given by the Connes fusion (i.e., the completed tensor product)of bimodules.However, one important aspect of Euclidean field theories is still missingfrom our description.Namely, Euclidean field theories are {\\\\it symmetric monoidal\\\\/} functors,where the symmetric monoidal structure on bordisms is given by the disjoint unionand on the target category it should come from some kind of tensor product.Thus we are naturally led into the question of constructing a suitable symmetric monoidalstructure on the double category of von Neumann algebras and bimodules.This involves constructing a tensor product of von Neumann algebrasand an {\\\\it external\\\\/} tensor product of bimodules (which should not be confusedwith the {\\\\it internal\\\\/} tensor product of bimodules, i.e., the Connes fusion).In terms of pure algebra, the external tensor product takes an $M$-$N$-bimodule~$X$ anda $P$-$Q$-bimodule~$Y$ and spits out an $M\\\\otimes P$-$N\\\\otimes Q$-bimodule~$X\\\\sqtimes Y$.(The internal tensor product takes an $L$-$M$-bimodule~$X$ and an $M$-$N$-bimodule~$Y$and spits out an $L$-$N$-bimodule~$X\\\\otimes_MY$.)Na\\\\\"\\\\i vely, one might expect that the usual spatial tensor product of von Neumann algebrascombined with the spatial external tensor product of bimodules should suffice.Unfortunately, the resulting symmetric monoidal structure is not flexible enough.In particular, we often need to move actions around, i.e.,we want to be able to pass from an $L\\\\otimes M$-$N$-bimodule to an $L$-$M^\\\\op\\\\otimes N$-bimoduleand vice versa.(Here for simplicity we suppress $\\\\L_d$ from our notation.)This is not possible with the spatial monoidal structure.For example, the algebra $M$ itself is an $M$-$M$-bimodule,but it almost never is a $\\\\C$-$M^\\\\op\\\\otimes M$-bimodule.Thus we are forced to look for a different monoidal structure.It turns out that the relevant tensor producton the level of algebras was defined by Guichardet in~1966.We call it the {\\\\it categorical tensor product},because it has good categorical universal properties.We construct a new external tensor product of bimodules,whose properties can be summarized as follows:\\\\proclaim Theorem.The symmetric monoidal category of von Neumann algebras and their isomorphismsequipped with the categorical tensor producttogether with the symmetric monoidal category of $\\\\L_0$-bimodules and their morphismsequipped with the categorical external tensor productform a symmetric monoidal framed double category.This symmetric monoidal structure has good properties,in particular, we can move actions around.In fact, every von Neumann algebra is {\\\\it

We summarize the above results as follows:\\\\proclaim Theorem.For any von Neumann algebra~$M$ and for any complex numbers $a$~and~$b$with a nonnegative real partthe multiplication map $\\\\L_a(M)\\\\otimes_M\\\\L_b(M)\\\\to\\\\L_{a+b}(M)$and the left multiplication map $\\\\L_a(M)\\\\to\\\\Hom_M(\\\\L_b(M),\\\\L_{a+b}(M))$are isometric isomorphisms of (quasi-)Banach $M$-$M$-bimodules.Here $\\\\otimes_M$ denotes the algebraic tensor product (without any kind of completion)and $\\\\Hom_M$ denotes the algebraic inner hom (without any kind of continuity restriction).The second main result of this dissertation is concerned with extension of the aboveresults to {\\\\it $\\\\L_p$-modules}, which were defined by Junge and Sherman in~2005.An $\\\\L_p(M)$-module over a von Neumann algebra~$M$ is an algebraic $M$-moduleequipped with an inner product with values in $\\\\L_{2p}(M)$.A typical example is given by the space $\\\\L_p(M)$ itself with the inner product $(x,y)=x^*y$.The phenomena of automatic completeness and continuity extend to $\\\\L_p$-modules.In particular, if $X$ is an $\\\\L_p(M)$-module, then $X\\\\otimes_M\\\\L_q(M)$is an $\\\\L_q(M)$-module.Similarly, if $Y$ is an $\\\\L_{p+q}(M)$-module, then $\\\\Hom_M(\\\\L_q(M),Y)$ is an $\\\\L_p(M)$-module.Of particular importance are the cases $p=0$ and $p=1/2$.$\\\\L_0(M)$-modules are also known as Hilbert W*-modules.The category of $\\\\L_{1/2}(M)$-modules is equivalent to the category of representationsof~$M$ on Hilbert spaces and the equivalence preserves the underlying algebraic $M$-module.We can summarize these results as follows:\\\\proclaim Theorem.For any von Neumann algebra~$M$ and for any nonnegative real numbers $d$~and~$e$the category of right $\\\\L_d(M)$-modules is equivalentto the category of right $\\\\L_{d+e}(M)$-modules.The equivalences are implemented by the algebraic tensor productand the algebraic inner hom with~$\\\\L_e(M)$.In particular, all categories of right $\\\\L_d(M)$-modules are equivalentto each other and to the category of representations of~$M$ on Hilbert spaces.This theorem can also be extended to bimodules.An $M$-$\\\\L_d(N)$-bimodule is a right $\\\\L_d(N)$-module~$X$equipped with a morphism of von Neumann algebras $M\\\\to\\\\End(X)$.Here $\\\\End(X)$ denotes the space of all continuous $N$-linear endomorphisms of~$X$.An $\\\\L_d(M)$-$N$-bimodule is defined similarly.In particular, the category of $M$-$\\\\L_{1/2}(N)$-bimodules is equivalentto the category of commuting representations (birepresentations) of $M$~and~$N$ on Hilbert spaces.The latter category is also equivalent to the category of $\\\\L_{1/2}(M)$-$N$-bimodules.These equivalences preserve the underlying algebraic $M$-$N$-bimodules,in particular, every $M$-$\\\\L_{1/2}(N)$-bimodule is also an $\\\\L_{1/2}(M)$-$N$-bimodule.\\\\proclaim Theorem.The categories of $\\\\L_d(M)$-$N$-bimodules, $M$-$\\\\L_d(N)$-bimodules,and commuting representations of $M$~and~$N$ on Hilbert spacesare all equivalent to each other.The equivalences for different values of~$d$ are implemented as usualby the algebraic tensor product and the algebraic inner hom with the relevant space~$\\\\L_e(M)$.The equivalence between $\\\\L_d(M)$-$N$-bimodules and $M$-$\\\\L_d(N)$-bimodulesis implemented by passing from an $\\\\L_d(M)$-$N$-bimoduleto an $\\\\L_{1/2}(M)$-$N$-bimodule, then reinterpreting the latter moduleas an $M$-$N$-birepresentation,then passing to an $M$-$\\\\L_{1/2}(N)$-bimodule, and finally passing to an $M$-$\\\\L_d(N)$-bimodule.(A weaker form of this result relating $\\\\L_0$-bimodulesand birepresentations was proved earlier by Baillet, Denizeau, and Havet,who used the completed tensor product and the continuous inner hom.)Note that passing from $\\\\L_d(M)$-$N$-bimodule to $M$-$\\\\L_d(N)$-bimodule can completelychange the underlying algebraic bimodule structure.For example, take $d=0$, $M=\\\\C$ (the field of complex numbers)and $N=B(H)$ for some Hilbert space~$H$.Then $B(H)$ is a $\\\\C$-$\\\\L_0(B(H))$-bimodule.The corresponding $\\\\L_0(\\\\C)$-$B(H)$-bimodule is $\\\\L_{1/2}(B(H))$(the space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators on~$H$), which is completely different from~$B(H)$.The above equivalences allow us to pass freely between different categories,choosing whatever category is the most convenient for the current problem.For example, Connes fusion can be most easily defined for $M$-$\\\\L_0(N)$-bimodules,where it is simply the completed tensor product.In fact, the easiest way to define the ``classical'' Connes fusion(Connes fusion of birepresentations) is to pass from birepresentations of $M$~and~$N$to $M$-$\\\\L_{1/2}(N)$-modules, then to $M$-$\\\\L_0(N)$-modules,then compute the completed tensor product, and then pass back to birepresentations.One of the reasons for studying $\\\\L_d$-bimodules is that they form a targetcategory for $2|1$-dimensional Euclidean field theories,which conjecturally describe the cohomology theory known as TMF (topological modular forms).More precisely, a Euclidean field theory is a 2-functor from a certain2-category of $2|1$-dimensional Euclidean bordisms to some algebraic 2-category,which in this case should consist of algebras, bimodules, and intertwiners of some sort.Thus we are naturally forced to organizevon Neumann algebras, right $\\\\L_d$-bimodules, and their morphismsinto some sort of a 2-category (more precisely, a framed double category):\\\\proclaim Theorem.There is a framed double category whose category of objects is the categoryof von Neumann algebras and their isomorphismsand the category of morphisms is the category of right $\\\\L_d$-bimodules (for all values of~$d$)and their morphisms.The composition of morphisms is given by the Connes fusion (i.e., the completed tensor product)of bimodules.However, one important aspect of Euclidean field theories is still missingfrom our description.Namely, Euclidean field theories are {\\\\it symmetric monoidal\\\\/} functors,where the symmetric monoidal structure on bordisms is given by the disjoint unionand on the target category it should come from some kind of tensor product.Thus we are naturally led into the question of constructing a suitable symmetric monoidalstructure on the double category of von Neumann algebras and bimodules.This involves constructing a tensor product of von Neumann algebrasand an {\\\\it external\\\\/} tensor product of bimodules (which should not be confusedwith the {\\\\it internal\\\\/} tensor product of bimodules, i.e., the Connes fusion).In terms of pure algebra, the external tensor product takes an $M$-$N$-bimodule~$X$ anda $P$-$Q$-bimodule~$Y$ and spits out an $M\\\\otimes P$-$N\\\\otimes Q$-bimodule~$X\\\\sqtimes Y$.(The internal tensor product takes an $L$-$M$-bimodule~$X$ and an $M$-$N$-bimodule~$Y$and spits out an $L$-$N$-bimodule~$X\\\\otimes_MY$.)Na\\\\\"\\\\i vely, one might expect that the usual spatial tensor product of von Neumann algebrascombined with the spatial external tensor product of bimodules should suffice.Unfortunately, the resulting symmetric monoidal structure is not flexible enough.In particular, we often need to move actions around, i.e.,we want to be able to pass from an $L\\\\otimes M$-$N$-bimodule to an $L$-$M^\\\\op\\\\otimes N$-bimoduleand vice versa.(Here for simplicity we suppress $\\\\L_d$ from our notation.)This is not possible with the spatial monoidal structure.For example, the algebra $M$ itself is an $M$-$M$-bimodule,but it almost never is a $\\\\C$-$M^\\\\op\\\\otimes M$-bimodule.Thus we are forced to look for a different monoidal structure.It turns out that the relevant tensor producton the level of algebras was defined by Guichardet in~1966.We call it the {\\\\it categorical tensor product},because it has good categorical universal properties.We construct a new external tensor product of bimodules,whose properties can be summarized as follows:\\\\proclaim Theorem.The symmetric monoidal category of von Neumann algebras and their isomorphismsequipped with the categorical tensor producttogether with the symmetric monoidal category of $\\\\L_0$-bimodules and their morphismsequipped with the categorical external tensor productform a symmetric monoidal framed double category.This symmetric monoidal structure has good properties,in particular, we can move actions around.In fact, every von Neumann algebra is {\\\\it dualizable\\\\/} in this monoidal structure:\\\\proclaim Theorem.In the above symmetric monoidal framed double categoryevery von Neumann algebra~$M$ is dualizable, with the dual von Neumann algebra being~$M^\\\\op$,the unit morphism being $\\\\L_{1/2}(M)$ as a $\\\\C$-$M^\\\\op\\\\otimes M$-birepresentation(more precisely, we take the corresponding $\\\\L_0$-bimodule)and the counit morphism being $\\\\L_{1/2}(M)$ as an $M\\\\otimes M^\\\\op$-$\\\\C$-birepresentation.We can compute categorified traces (shadows)of arbitrary endomorphisms of any dualizable object in a symmetric monoidal double category(or a bicategory)in the same way we compute the trace of a dualizable object in a symmetric monoidal category.In our case we can compute the shadow of any $A$-$A$-bimodule,which turns out to be a $\\\\C$-$\\\\C$-bimodule, i.e., a complex vector space.Of particular importance are the shadows of identity bimodules:\\\\proclaim Theorem.For any von Neumann algebra~$M$ the shadow of~$M$ as an $M$-$M$-bimoduleis isomorphic to $\\\\L_{1/2}(\\\\Z(M))$, where $\\\\Z(M)$ denotes the center of~$M$.The general theory developed by Ponto and Shulman allows us to take tracesof arbitrary endomorphisms of dualizable 1-morphisms in any bicategory equipped with a shadow.It is a well-known fact that dualizable 1-morphisms in the bicategoryof von Neumann algebras, $\\\\L_0$-bimodules, and intertwinersare precisely {\\\\it finite index bimodules}.If $f$ is an endomorphism of an $M$-$N$-bimodule,then the left trace of~$f$ is a morphism $\\\\L_{1/2}(\\\\Z(M))\\\\to\\\\L_{1/2}(\\\\Z(N))$and the right trace of~$f$ is a morphism in the opposite direction.Since the right trace is the adjoint of the left trace,we concentrate exclusively on the left trace.If $M$ and $N$ are factors, then $\\\\L_{1/2}(\\\\Z(M))=\\\\L_{1/2}(\\\\Z(N))=\\\\C$,thus the left trace is a number and we recover the classical Jones indexas the trace of the

  "title" : "Geotechnical analysis of large volcanic landslides: The La Orotava events on Tenerife,Canary Islands",
  "description" : "Large volcanic landslides are one of the most hazardous of geological processes. They have occurred about once every 25 years during the last 500 years, and are a serious risk for the population due to their great volume and mobility. In spite of their destructive potential there are few comprehensive studies analysing large landslides on volcano flanks, and the mechanisms of such mass movements are not yet resolved. Within the last few years, several hypotheses concerning the potential causes of volcanic landslides have been proposed including processes such as dike intrusion, volcanic spreading, hydrothermal alteration, seismic shocks and caldera collapse events.Tenerife exhibits three large subaerial valleys originated by giant flank failures with ages ranging from Upper Pliocene to Middle Pleistocene. The northern submarine flank of the island is characterised by a voluminous apron of landslide debris. The La Orotava valley has been selected for analysis due to the amount of available data concerning its structure and evolution, and has been used as a test site to validate new assumptions that could be applied to other volcanic areas. The site investigation has revealed that the present morphology of the La Orotava valley was formed by two different failures: one in the western sector and the other in the eastern sector. The mechanical stability of the preslide volcano flank was strongly reduced by geologic, morphologic, climatic and volcanological factors which play a fundamental role in the initiation of the landslides. Widespread residual soils (paleosols) might have acted as potential slip surfaces, while deep erosive canyons probably evolved into the lateral limits of the failures. A high coastal cliff and a humid climate have also contributed to the critical stability conditions. The location of the landslide amphitheatre is perpendicular to the active Dorsal rift zone and adjacent to the Las Cañadas caldera, both important influences on the stability of the volcano slopes. On Tenerife, the relationship between large volcanic landslides and vertical caldera collapses is supported by a temporal coincidence of at least two failures with caldera collapse events.The mechanical behaviour of a residual soil sampled in the La Orotava valley has been analysed. Red coloured residual soils are generally located at the top of phonolitic pyroclastic deposits and are proposed as potential slip surfaces due to their very weak behaviour and their flat, homogeneous characteristics. They represent the only planar surface within the succession making up the volcano slopes. Their weak mechanical behaviour is characterised by volumetric collapse during shearing, a substantial reduction of shear strength for high normal stresses, and a significant increase of pore water pressure during undrained loading. The last feature is fundamental to the stability of volcano flanks since it strongly reduces the soil strength. Earthquakes, common processes in active volcanic areas, and saturated conditions can generate high excess pore pressures indicating the importance of regional climate and seismicity. The stability analysis has considered three different mechanisms: 1) ground acceleration due to seismicity - including both tectonic earthquakes and volcano-tectonic seismic shocks produced by caldera collapse; 2) horizontal stress due to dike intrusion, and; 3) vertical shear stress due to caldera collapse. The results indicate that ground acceleration principally decreases the mechanical stability of volcano flanks, enabling failure. Horizontal stresses due to dike intrusion can also influence slope stability, but preferably act as a preparing factor destabilising the slope, and not as a final triggering mechanism. The 3D numerical simulations show the significant effect of deeply incised canyons creating high shear stress at their base. Applying the results to the La Orotava events, the following scenario is assumed:  First, deep narrow canyons, weak residual soils, humid climate, coastal cliff and persistent dike intrusion have significantly reduced the mechanical stability of the volcano slope and determined the limits of the failing mass. Then, seismicity generated by the caldera collapse episode at the end of the Guajara cycle at ~0.56 Ma triggered the catastrophic landslides.The results of the mobility analysis show the important influence of water on the runout distances of landslides. Subaqueous drag forces reduce the velocity, while hydroplaning effects strongly increase the runout distance. For Tenerife, the model indicates that a sliding mass can advance great distances, tens of kilometres away from the island, at water depths exceeding 3000 m, as can be observed in the bathymetric data.",

  "title" : "Electron-impact excitation of neutral boron using the R-matrix with pseudostates method",
  "description" : "<p>We have carried out a large R-matrix with pseudostates (RMPS) calculation of the electron-impact excitation of neutral boron. The RMPS method has been employed for the excitation/ionisation of many light fusion related species, but primarily for one or two active electrons. The present 640-term close-coupling calculation included three distinct pseudostate expansions. This enabled us to converge both the N-electron structure for three active open-shell electrons and accurately represent the high Rydberg and target continuum states.

  "texts" : [ "Electron-impact excitation of neutral boron using the R-matrix with pseudostates method", "<p>We have carried out a large R-matrix with pseudostates (RMPS) calculation of the electron-impact excitation of neutral boron. The RMPS method has been employed for the excitation/ionisation of many light fusion related species, but primarily for one or two active electrons. The present 640-term close-coupling calculation included three distinct pseudostate expansions. This enabled us to converge both the N-electron structure for three active open-shell electrons and accurately represent the high Rydberg and target continuum states.

  "title" : "Characterising the multi-component sources of subduction zone magmas: A geochemical study of submarine volcanoes and active spreading centres, Vanuatu",
  "description" : "The currently accepted model for subduction zone magmatism involves metasomatism of the mantle wedge by slab-derived components and then subsequent partial melting of this source. However, there is no consensus on whether the slab-derived component is transferred as a hydrous fluid, a silicate melt, or both. Whether these fluids or melts are derived from the altered oceanic crust, the subducted sediment, or both is also debated. Constraining the nature of the subduction component has important implications for solid-fluid-melt partitioning and slab dehydration depths, particularly elemental budgets and recycling of elements into the deep mantle. Vanuatu is an intra-oceanic subduction zone in the SW Pacific where recent scientific cruises have mapped and dredged submarine lavas that extend the sample coverage of the Vanuatu arc. Major and trace elements and radiogenic isotopes are used to identify the source and transfer mechanism of slab-derived components in the\n  Vanuatu subduction zone. Mixing calculations estimate the mantle wedge, sediment and fluid contributions to Vanuatu arc and backarc lavas. New geochemical results are integrated with the large database of published results for Vanuatu, to investigate the along- and across-arc variation in the slab component and mantle domains. Lavas from the Vanuatu backarc have Indian-like Pb isotope ratios, similar to the Indian-type mantle signatures of central arc volcanoes, but distinct from adjacent southern arc volcanoes with Pacific-like Pb isotope ratios. The Pb isotopic anomaly (∆8/4) in the Vanuatu subduction zone decreases from the central arc segment to the southern backarc, implying trench-parallel flow of Indian-type mantle to the south. The spatial distribution of mantle domains implies that mantle flow patterns in southern Vanuatu are dominated by southward trench-parallel flow, rather than pure corner flow induced by viscous drag along the upper surface of the subducting plate.\n  This southward flow appears to be related to pressure gradients developed during asymmetric rollback of the Australian plate. Despite these unusual mantle dynamics in southern Vanuatu, a subduction component is detectable in the across-arc and backarc lavas. In the southern Vanuatu backarc, the average amount of sediment addition decreases from ~1.2% in the north trough to ~0.3% in the central trough. The average amount of altered oceanic crust fluid addition also decreases from ~0.3% in the northern trough to ~0.1% in the central trough. The southern backarc trough lavas are not enriched in large ion lithophile elements and have light rare earth element depletions, suggesting that these lavas do not have a significant contribution from slab-derived components. In the across-arc volcanoes, the average amount of sediment addition decreases from ~2% in the volcanic front to ~0.5% in the easternmost across-arc volcano. The average amount of altered oceanic crust fluid addition also\n  decreases from ~0.9% in the volcanic front to ~0.3% in the easternmost across-arc volcano. For the backarc and across-arc lavas, sediment and fluid contributions progressively decrease with distance from the trench. Fluid-mobile/fluid-immobile trace element ratios, such as Ba/Yb and Ba/La ratios also decrease with distance from the trench and support progressive distillation of the subducting slab. Enrichment of fluid mobile elements in the southern across-arc volcanoes reflects the addition of hydrous fluids to slab depths of at least 200 km. These constraints on slab dehydration signify that not all fluid mobile elements are recycled at shallow depths. The degree of melting in the across-arc volcanoes progressively decreases with depth to the slab, demonstrating that the degree of melting is not solely controlled by the melt column height. Smaller degree melts from southern Vanuatu have a smaller contribution from slab-derived components. These constraints argue for fluid-fluxed\n  melting, where the extent of melting progressively decreases as the amount of slab-derived fluid decreases. This positive wet melting function contrasts with that observed at mid ocean ridges, where increasing water content of the mantle source is associated with decreasing extents of melting.",
