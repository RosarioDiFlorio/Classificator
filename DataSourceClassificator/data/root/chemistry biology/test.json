  "description" : "PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between human papillomavirus (HPV) genotype and outcome after radiation therapy and intrinsic radiosensitivity. METHODS AND MATERIALS: HPV genotyping was performed on cervix biopsies by polymerase chain reaction using SPF-10 broad-spectrum primers, followed by deoxyribonucleic acid enzyme immunoassay and genotyping by reverse hybridization line probe assay (LiPA(25)) (version 1) (n=202). PapilloCheck and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were used to genotype cervix cancer cell lines (n=16). Local progression-free survival after radiation therapy alone was assessed using log-rank and Cox proportionate hazard analyses. Intrinsic radiosensitivity was measured as surviving fraction at 2 Gy (SF2) using clonogenic assays. RESULTS: Of the 202 tumors, 107 (53.0%) were positive for HPV16, 29 (14.4%) for HPV18, 9 (4.5%) for HPV45, 23 (11.4%) for other HPV genotypes, and 22 (10.9%) were negative; 11 (5.5%) contained multiple genotypes, and 1 tumor was HPV X (0.5%). In 148 patients with outcome data, those with HPVα9-positive tumors had better local progression-free survival compared with α7 patients in univariate (P<.004) and multivariate (hazard ratio 1.54, 95% confidence interval 1.11-1.76, P=.021) analyses. There was no difference in the median SF2 of α9 and α7 cervical tumors (n=63). In the cell lines, 9 were α7 and 4 α9 positive and 3 negative.

  "description" : "The small GTPase Rac1 is ubiquitously expressed in proliferating and differentiating layers of the epidermis and hair follicles. Previously, Rac1 was shown to regulate stem cell behaviour in these compartments. We have asked whether Rac1 has, in addition, a specific, stem-cell-independent function in the regulation of terminal hair follicle differentiation. To address this, we have expressed a constitutively active mutant of Rac1, L61Rac1, only in the basal epidermal layer and outer root sheath of mice possessing an epidermis-specific deletion of endogenous Rac1, which experience severe hair loss. The resulting 'rescue' mice exhibited a hair coat throughout their lives. Therefore, expression of Rac1 activity in the keratin-14-positive compartment of the skin is sufficient for the formation of hair follicles and hair in normal quantities. The quality of hair formed in rescue mice was, however, not normal. Rescue mice showed a grey, dull hair coat, whereas that of wild-type and L61Rac1-transgenic mice was black and shiny. Hair analysis in rescue mice revealed altered structures of the hair shaft and the cuticle and disturbed organization of medulla cells and pigment distribution. Disorganization of medulla cells correlates with the absence of cortical, keratin-filled spikes that normally protrude from the cortex into the medulla. The desmosomal cadherin Dsc2, which normally decorates these protrusions, was found to be reduced or absent in the hair of rescue mice.

We mimic a typical experimental protocol that involves isometric force generation through triggering of the contractile machinery, followed by oscillatory length fluctuation of the cell. We use the model to predict the effect of a single instance of rearrangement of the contractile machinery, combined with strain-stiffening of the cytoskeleton, on the force generated by the sarcomeres, and the total force generated by the cell. By linking intra-cellular events to whole-cell behaviour, the model reveals mechanistic relationships between structural properties and cell-level force–length loops.

Additionally, we show how interactions between the internal contractile machinery and cytoskeletal structure play a role in the regulation of force generation and hysteresis of the cell.", null ],

  "description" : "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a frequent cause of severe lung disease in young children. Primed T cells are required for virus clearance, but are causally implicated in the enhanced pathology seen following RSV infection of some infants and experimental animals vaccinated against the virus. In BALB/c mice, vaccination with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the viral attachment protein (G) leads to pulmonary eosinophilia during subsequent infection, which indirect evidence suggests may be due to CD4+ Th2 cells. The production of IFN-gamma, IL-2, -4, -5 and -10 cytokine mRNA by RT-PCR and intracellular cytokines by flow cytometry following RSV challenge of vaccinated mice were therefore compared. Lung eosinophilia was associated with enhanced local recruitment of CD4+ cells in G sensitized mice, while CD8+ cells dominated in mice vaccinated with the viral fusion protein (F) or second matrix protein (M2). Lung eosinophilia was also associated with a localized reduction in IFN-gamma and increased IL-4 and IL-5 mRNA transcription as well as elevated RSV specific IgG1 antibody production. Th2 cytokine protein production by T cells showed no apparent change. Although IFN-gamma production diminished in eosinophilic mice, it remained the major cytokine found in lung T cells.

Consequently, many pregnancy complications are associated with altered placental biochemistry and structure.

Animals were randomized to receive biomaterial tubes enveloping the tendon injuries or left untreated. Digits, amputated at 2 weeks, were randomized to mechanical pullout assessments of adhesion strength or to quantitative histologic cellularity and immunohistochemical proliferation (Ki67) assessments. RESULTS: The mean peak pullout force required to break the adhesions was reduced from 7.70 N (n = 6) in untreated digits to 0.31 N (n = 7) in biomaterial-treated digits (p = 0.001).

  "description" : "Tissue regeneration repairs the fabric of the skin to maintain homeostasis after injury. The expression and proliferation of extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules in the dermis, mediated by a range of growth factors and cytokines, is a fundamental element of wound repair. Previous work focused on how these complex molecular mechanisms relate to the formation of raised dermal scars, including keloid and hypertrophic scars, characterized by excessive deposition of ECM molecules. However, the mechanisms in the wound repair pathway which lead to the differential expression and organization of ECM molecules observed in different types of scar tissue are not fully understood. To summarize what is known about the expression and composition of ECM molecules in abnormal scarring, an extensive search of the literature was conducted, focusing on keywords connected to skin scarring, hypertrophic scars and keloid disease. The transcription and translation of collagen I and III, fibronectin, laminin, periostin and tenascin are all increased in raised dermal scar tissue. However, hyaluronic acid, dermatopontin and decorin are decreased, and the expression and localisation of fibrillin and elastin fibres in the dermis are altered compared with normal skin and scars. Recent whole genome profiling and proteomic studies have led to the identification of regulatory elements with different expression profiles in hypertrophic and keloid tissue.

The expression and proliferation of extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules in the dermis, mediated by a range of growth factors and cytokines, is a fundamental element of wound repair. Previous work focused on how these complex molecular mechanisms relate to the formation of raised dermal scars, including keloid and hypertrophic scars, characterized by excessive deposition of ECM molecules. However, the mechanisms in the wound repair pathway which lead to the differential expression and organization of ECM molecules observed in different types of scar tissue are not fully understood. To summarize what is known about the expression and composition of ECM molecules in abnormal scarring, an extensive search of the literature was conducted, focusing on keywords connected to skin scarring, hypertrophic scars and keloid disease. The transcription and translation of collagen I and III, fibronectin, laminin, periostin and tenascin are all increased in raised dermal scar tissue. However, hyaluronic acid, dermatopontin and decorin are decreased, and the expression and localisation of fibrillin and elastin fibres in the dermis are altered compared with normal skin and scars. Recent whole genome profiling and proteomic studies have led to the identification of regulatory elements with different expression profiles in hypertrophic and keloid tissue. If the mechanisms of raised dermal scar formation are to be elucidated and effective therapeutic treatments developed, an integrated approach to research is required, focussing on the interactions between ECM molecules, regulatory elements and pathways.", null ],

  "description" : "Discovery of Arhgap28, a Molecule Involved in Controlling Cell Forces Important in Making a Strong TendonMovements of the body such as running or gripping a door handle require strong tissue types such as muscle, bone, tendon, ligament and cartilage. These tissues make up the musculoskeletal system. Their ability to transmit and withstand mechanical loading is because of a rope-like protein called collagen, which surrounds the cells. Collagen is important as it allows tissues of the body to endure the constant forces of being pulled, pushed and squashed. In bone tissue, these fibrils are woven together to allow calcium to bind, which creates strong bone that can bear the weight of the body. The collagen ropes or ‘fibrils’ in tendon are bundled together like a rope so that tendons can be stretched repetitively without breaking. How the collagen fibrils are organised is linked to the function of the tissue. A disadvantage of having such a unique and strong tissue structure is that once damaged, the collagen fibrils do not fully repair, often resulting in poor healing and long-term recovery. It is estimated that the annual cost of tendon injury in the UK is £25 billion. Scientists led by Professor Karl Kadler at the University of Manchester want to understand how organisation of collagen fibrils is established during the formation of musculoskeletal tissues, so that new medical treatments to improve tissue healing may be developed. As a starting point, the scientists began studying tendon tissue. Since 2004, they have discovered that the cells that live in tendon are responsible for organising the collagen fibrils into non-crisscrossing, straight strands. They found that the cell scaffolding plays important roles in the organisation of collagen fibrils and in generating pulling forces used to make tendons strong. This PhD project investigated the idea that the organisation of the scaffolding inside the cell is responsible for determining the arrangement of the collagen fibrils outside the cell. Scientists found a gene called Arhgap28 that is more prevalent in cells when they make tendon tissues. Experiments showed that Arhgap28 could prevent the cell scaffolding from generating pulling forces. Scientists now think that Arhgap28 controls how the cell is able to touch and pull on fibrils so that they can be arranged correctly and produce a tissue that is not too stiff and not too loose.

It is well established that the generation of a type two response, characterised by CD4+ T cell secretion of interleukin (IL)-13, IL-4 and IL-9 will expel most gastrointestinal helminths. Expulsion is mediated by a variety of effector mechanisms including altered mucin production, intestinal mast cell activation, increased epithelial cell turnover and increased muscle contraction. Protective immunity can be generated over time; however, infections can persist to chronicity following the modulation of a protective type two response, such as the generation of a type one response. This response, characterised by IFN-γ and IL 12 secretion, can lead to long lived infections, placing huge morbidity upon infected individuals. The mechanisms leading to the generation of a type one or type two response are not fully understood and are of paramount importance if a vaccine to helminth parasites is to be developed. In addition, the dysregulation of these responses is thought to be the cause of allergy and autoimmunity and understanding the regulation of type two responses will also add to our understanding of these diseases.Numerous labs have recently reported roles for new innate cells, such as nuocytes, as sources of IL 13, a cytokine critical to worm expulsion.  In addition, data from this lab has demonstrated that NK cell derived IL-13 is the cause of pathology during infection with Trichinella spiralis. It has also been shown that NK cells provide a supplementary source of IL-13 in Trichuris muris infected IL-4-/- mice. This thesis has used 2 strains of mice; the E4bp4-/- mouse and the Il13eGFP reporter mouse, in order to dissect the role of innate cells in the immune response to the related helminth parasites T. muris and T. spiralis. The transcription factor E4BP4 has been shown to control CD4+ T cell IL-5 and 13 secretion and the development of NK cells. Data presented in this thesis shows that following a low dose infection, which usually persists to chronicity in WT mice, E4bp4-/- mice were able to expel the parasite following the generation of an elevated type two response. This effect was abrogated following CD4+ T cell depletion, indicative of an essential role for these cells in this response. It was also shown that E4BP4 ablation was sufficient to delay expulsion of a high dose of T. muris, indicative of a key role for E4BP4 in regulating type two responses to T. muris. Contrary to the hypothesis, it was demonstrated that NK cells did not play a major role in protective immunity to T. muris.In addition, the data presented here shows, for the first time, the induction of nuocytes in the MLN following both T. muris and T. spiralis infection. Nuocytes made an early contribution to IL-13 secretion following T. spiralis infection; whereas low levels of Il13eGFP+ cells were observed only at day 18-21 post T. muris infection, with nuocytes making a less significant contribution to IL-13 levels. The levels of different cell lineages in the MLN post infection and their contribution to IL-13 expression was also mapped in detail.Finally, an analysis of the haematopoietic response in the bone marrow following T. muris infection was undertaken. The percentage and number of early progenitor Lineage-Sca-1+c-kit+ (LSK) cells in the bone marrow increased at day 21 post T. muris infection. LSK levels returned to normal after this time, indicative of an inflammation dependent response.

  "title" : "Matrix remodeling stimulates stromal autophagy, \"fueling\" cancer cell mitochondrial metabolism and metastasis.",
  "description" : "We have previously demonstrated that loss of stromal caveolin-1 (Cav-1) in cancer-associated fibroblasts is a strong and independent predictor of poor clinical outcome in human breast cancer patients. However, the signaling mechanism(s) by which Cav-1 downregulation leads to this tumor-promoting microenvironment are not well understood. To address this issue, we performed an unbiased comparative proteomic analysis of wild-type (WT) and Cav-1(-/-) null mammary stromal fibroblasts (MSFs). Our results show that plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 and type 2 (PAI-1 and PAI-2) expression is significantly increased in Cav-1(-/-) MSFs. To establish a direct cause-effect relationship, we next generated immortalized human fibroblast lines stably overexpressing either PAI-1 or PAI-2. Importantly, PAI-1/2(+) fibroblasts promote the growth of MDA-MB-231 tumors (a human breast cancer cell line) in a murine xenograft model, without any increases in angiogenesis. Similarly, PAI-1/2(+) fibroblasts stimulate experimental metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells using an in vivo lung colonization assay. Further mechanistic studies revealed that fibroblasts overexpressing PAI-1 or PAI-2 display increased autophagy (\"self-eating\") and are sufficient to induce mitochondrial biogenesis/activity in adjacent cancer cells, in co-culture experiments. In xenografts, PAI-1/2(+) fibroblasts significantly reduce the apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 tumor cells. The current study provides further support for the \"Autophagic Tumor Stroma Model of Cancer\" and identifies a novel \"extracellular matrix\"-based signaling mechanism, by which a loss of stromal Cav-1 generates a metastatic phenotype. Thus, the secretion and remodeling of extracellular matrix components (such as PAI-1/2) can directly regulate both (1) autophagy in stromal fibroblasts and (2) epithelial tumor cell mitochondrial metabolism.",
  "texts" : [ "Matrix remodeling stimulates stromal autophagy, \"fueling\" cancer cell mitochondrial metabolism and metastasis.", "We have previously demonstrated that loss of stromal caveolin-1 (Cav-1) in cancer-associated fibroblasts is a strong and independent predictor of poor clinical outcome in human breast cancer patients. However, the signaling mechanism(s) by which Cav-1 downregulation leads to this tumor-promoting microenvironment are not well understood. To address this issue, we performed an unbiased comparative proteomic analysis of wild-type (WT) and Cav-1(-/-) null mammary stromal fibroblasts (MSFs). Our results show that plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 and type 2 (PAI-1 and PAI-2) expression is significantly increased in Cav-1(-/-) MSFs. To establish a direct cause-effect relationship, we next generated immortalized human fibroblast lines stably overexpressing either PAI-1 or PAI-2. Importantly, PAI-1/2(+) fibroblasts promote the growth of MDA-MB-231 tumors (a human breast cancer cell line) in a murine xenograft model, without any increases in angiogenesis. Similarly, PAI-1/2(+) fibroblasts stimulate experimental metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells using an in vivo lung colonization assay. Further mechanistic studies revealed that fibroblasts overexpressing PAI-1 or PAI-2 display increased autophagy (\"self-eating\") and are sufficient to induce mitochondrial biogenesis/activity in adjacent cancer cells, in co-culture experiments. In xenografts, PAI-1/2(+) fibroblasts significantly reduce the apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 tumor cells. The current study provides further support for the \"Autophagic Tumor Stroma Model of Cancer\" and identifies a novel \"extracellular matrix\"-based signaling mechanism, by which a loss of stromal Cav-1 generates a metastatic phenotype.

  "description" : "Human native milk lactoferrin (LF) and recombinant forms of lactoferrin (rLF) are available with identical aa sequences, but different glycosylation patterns. Native lactoferrin (NLF) possesses the intrinsic ability to stimulate vigorous IgG and IgE antibody responses in BALB/c mice, whereas recombinant forms (Aspergillus or rice) are 40-fold less immunogenic and 200-fold less allergenic. Such differences are independent of endotoxin or iron content and the glycans do not contribute to epitope formation. A complex glycoprofile is observed for NLF, including sialic acid, fucose, mannose and Lewis (Le)(x) structures, whereas both rLF species display a simpler glycoprofile rich in mannose. Although Le(x) type sugars play a Th2-type adjuvant role, endogenous expression of Le(x) on NLF did not completely account for the more vigorous IgE responses it provoked. Furthermore, co-adminstration of rLF down-regulated IgE and up-regulated IgG2a antibody responses provoked by NLF, but was without effect on responses to unrelated peanut and chicken egg allergens.

The Shewanella cells were also able to remove the color from dyed cotton fabric that was isolated inside a dialysis membrane to prevent contact with the cells.

Functions of the IS vary with circumstance and include directing secretion and integrating positive and negative signals to determine the extent of response.", null ],

  "description" : "Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA (MPS IIIA or Sanfilippo disease) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme sulfamidase (SGSH), catabolizing heparan sulfate (HS). Affected children present with severe behavioral abnormalities, sleep disturbances, and progressive neurodegeneration, leading to death in their second decade. MPS I, a similar neurodegenerative disease accumulating HS, is treated successfully with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) but this treatment is ineffectual for MPS IIIA. We compared HSCT in MPS IIIA mice using wild-type donor cells transduced ex vivo with lentiviral vector-expressing SGSH (LV-WT-HSCT) versus wild-type donor cell transplant (WT-HSCT) or lentiviral-SGSH transduced MPS IIIA cells (LV-IIIA-HSCT). LV-WT-HSCT results in 10% of normal brain enzyme activity, near normalization of brain HS and GM2 gangliosides, significant improvements in neuroinflammation and behavioral correction. Both WT-HSCT and LV-IIIA-HSCT mediated improvements in GM2 gangliosides and neuroinflammation but were less effective at reducing HS or in ameliorating abnormal HS sulfation and had no significant effect on behavior. This suggests that HS may have a more significant role in neuropathology than neuroinflammation or GM2 gangliosides. These data provide compelling evidence for the efficacy of gene therapy in conjunction with WT-HSCT for neurological correction of MPS IIIA where conventional transplant is ineffectual.",

  "description" : "BACKGROUND: the link between the vitamin D endocrine axis and frailty remains undefined, with few studies examining the joint effect of vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Our objective was to determine the association of frailty with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and PTH.Setting: cross-sectional analysis within the European Male Ageing Study (EMAS).Participants: a total of 1,504 community-dwelling men aged 60-79 years. METHODS: frailty was classified using a frailty phenotype (FP) and frailty index (FI). The association of frailty with 25(OH)D and PTH was examined using multinomial logistic regression; individual FP criteria with 25(OH)D and PTH using binary logistic regression. Results were expressed as relative odds ratios (ROR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for multinomial; odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs for binary models. RESULTS: using the FP, 5.0% of subjects were classified as frail and 36.6% as prefrail. Lower levels of 25(OH)D were associated with being prefrail (per 1 SD decrease: ROR = 1.45; 95% CI: 1.26-1.67) and frail (ROR = 1.89; 95% CI: 1.30-2.76), after adjusting for age, centre and health and lifestyle confounders (robust group = base category). Higher levels of PTH were associated with being frail after adjustment for confounders (per 1 SD increase: ROR = 1.24; 95% CI: 1.01-1.52). Comparable results were found using the FI. Among the five FP criteria only sarcopenia was not associated with 25(OH)D levels, while only weakness was associated with PTH.

  "description" : "We report that two classes of membrane nanotubes between human monocyte-derived macrophages can be distinguished by their cytoskeletal structure and their functional properties. Thin membrane nanotubes contained only F-actin, whereas thicker nanotubes, i.e., those > approximately 0.7 microm in diameter, contained both F-actin and microtubules. Bacteria could be trapped and surf along thin, but not thick, membrane nanotubes toward connected macrophage cell bodies. Once at the cell body, bacteria could then be phagocytosed.

Analysis from kymographs demonstrated that vesicles moved in a stepwise, bidirectional manner at approximately 1 microm/s, consistent with their traffic being mediated by the microtubules found only in thick nanotubes. Vesicular traffic in thick nanotubes and surfing of beads along thin nanotubes were both stopped upon the addition of azide, demonstrating that both processes require ATP. However, microtubule destabilizing agents colchicine or nocodazole abrogated vesicular transport but not the flow of the nanotube surface, confirming that distinct cytoskeletal structures of nanotubes give rise to different functional properties.

STUDY DESIGN: Observational study of patients seen and operated at the Sophia Children's Hospital in Rotterdam, The Netherlands between 1989 and 2005. METHODS: Based on clinical appearance, each ear was placed into one of the five groups of the proposed classification and into one of the four stages of Sadé's classification. Preoperative air and bone conduction thresholds and air-bone gaps (ABG) were calculated using the four-tone pure-tone (500, 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 Hz) averages for bone and air conduction. RESULTS: : Of the 248 ears in the study group, 72 were in stage I, with an ABG of 18.2 +/- 12.3 dB. Twenty-two were in stage II, with an ABG of 12.9 +/- 9.5 dB.

  "title" : "pH-responsive, redox-sensitive hollow particles for the repair of load-bearing soft tissue",
  "description" : "This thesis presents an investigation of pH-responsive, redox-sensitive poly(MMA-co- MAA) and poly(EA-co-MAA) hollow particles for the repair of load-bearing soft tissues, such as articular cartilage and the intervertebral disc.\tHollow particles continue to attract major interest due to their numerous potential applications. The new method for hollow particle preparation presented in this thesis does not require the use of a colloidal template and is well suited for scaling up. Hollow particles were formed using linear poly(MMA-co-MAA) and poly(EA-co-MAA) aliphatic copolymers synthesised using free-radical chain copolymerisation performed in solution. These copolymers were dissolved in dichloromethane using methanol as a cosolvent and emulsified in water. Diffusion of the methanol into the aqueous phase prompts precipitation of the copolymer at the droplet/water interface. The more hydrophobic copolymers containing less MAA showed improved morphology compared to copolymers containing more MAA. Also, poly(EA-co-MAA) hollow particles had a more spherical morphology than poly(MMA-co-MAA) hollow particles with equivalent MAA contents. This was attributed to the lower Tg of the EA structural monomer, which resulted in more flexible particle shells.\tUnusually, during potentiometric titration of uncrosslinked hollow particles, the pH of the system decreased with increasing neutralisation. This behaviour is thought to be due to the unfolding of copolymer chains, exposing shielded carboxyl groups. The random structure of the copolymers is believed to be necessary for this behaviour. Crosslinked particles became swollen when the pH was increased using buffers. Concentrated dispersions formed self supporting gels, due to steric confinement, at 5 wt.%. The crosslinking process was performed by functionalising with cystamine using carbodiimide chemistry. This introduced disulphide crosslinks; which could be cleaved under reducing conditions at high pH, dissolving the gels. This ability to reduce the hollow particle shells to their constituent linear copolymer chains gives potential for natural removal from the body via extraction by the renal system. pH-triggered loading and release of a hydrophilic dye using crosslinked hollow particles was demonstrated. The similarity of the particle formation process to traditional solvent evaporation also allowed the loading of a hydrophobic dye. However, these particles were not crosslinked so release following swelling could not be investigated.\tCystamine-crosslinked systems suffered from degradation due to thiol-disulphide exchange at high pH (~ pH 8). Crosslinking of one system was performed using 2-amino ethyl methacrylate (AEM). This introduced covalent, vinyl intra-shell crosslinking; which did not break down at high pH. Additional AEM was also used to allow inter-particle UVcrosslinking to form doubly crosslinked (DX) hollow-particle hydrogels. These gels did not re-disperse in buffer. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a covalent hydrogel formed from pH-responsive hollow particles. The DX gels offer improved mechanical properties compared to the singly crosslinked, physical gels.\tFreeze-dried samples of all of the gels produced during this study showed highly porous structures when observed using SEM. The rapid diffusion of FITC-dextran through a sample of DX gel indicates that these pores were interconnected. This is beneficial as it encourages tissue ingrowth, in addition to allowing the rapid diffusion of nutrients, oxygen and cell waste in vivo.",
  "texts" : [ "pH-responsive, redox-sensitive hollow particles for the repair of load-bearing soft tissue", "This thesis presents an investigation of pH-responsive, redox-sensitive poly(MMA-co- MAA) and poly(EA-co-MAA) hollow particles for the repair of load-bearing soft tissues, such as articular cartilage and the intervertebral disc.\tHollow particles continue to attract major interest due to their numerous potential applications. The new method for hollow particle preparation presented in this thesis does not require the use of a colloidal template and is well suited for scaling up. Hollow particles were formed using linear poly(MMA-co-MAA) and poly(EA-co-MAA) aliphatic copolymers synthesised using free-radical chain copolymerisation performed in solution. These copolymers were dissolved in dichloromethane using methanol as a cosolvent and emulsified in water. Diffusion of the methanol into the aqueous phase prompts precipitation of the copolymer at the droplet/water interface. The more hydrophobic copolymers containing less MAA showed improved morphology compared to copolymers containing more MAA. Also, poly(EA-co-MAA) hollow particles had a more spherical morphology than poly(MMA-co-MAA) hollow particles with equivalent MAA contents.

  "description" : "The treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) due to Candida glabrata is challenging, with limited therapeutic options. Unexplained disappointing clinical efficacy has been reported with systemic and topical azole antifungal agents in spite of in vitro susceptibility. Given that the vaginal pH of patients with VVC is unchanged at 4 to 4.5, we studied the effect of pH on the in vitro activity of 11 antifungal agents against 40 C. glabrata isolates and compared activity against 15 fluconazole-sensitive and 10 reduced-fluconazole-susceptibility C. albicans strains. In vitro susceptibility to flucytosine, fluconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, clotrimazole, miconazole, ciclopirox olamine, amphotericin B, and caspofungin was determined using the CLSI method for yeast susceptibility testing. Test media were buffered to pHs of 7, 6, 5, and 4. Under conditions of reduced pH, C. glabrata isolates remained susceptible to caspofungin and flucytosine; however, there was a dramatic increase in the MIC(90) for amphotericin B and every azole drug tested. Although susceptible to other azole drugs tested at pH 7, C. albicans strains with reduced fluconazole susceptibility also demonstrated reduced susceptibility to amphotericin B and all azoles at pH 4. In contrast, fluconazole-sensitive C. albicans isolates remained susceptible at low pH to azoles, in keeping with clinical observations. In selecting agents for treatment of recurrent C. glabrata vaginitis, clinicians should recognize the limitations of in vitro susceptibility testing utilizing pH 7.0.",

  "description" : "To characterize the metabolic role of peroxisomes in yeast cells under physiological conditions, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of published microarray data. Previous studies of yeast peroxisomes have mainly been focused on the function of peroxisomes under extreme conditions, such as growth on oleate or methanol as the sole carbon source, and may therefore not be representative of the normal physiological role of yeast peroxisomes. Surprisingly, our analysis of the microarray data reveals that the only pathway responding to peroxisome deficiency in mid-log phase is lysine biosynthesis, whereas classical peroxisomal pathways such as beta-oxidation are unaffected. We show that the upregulation of lysine biosynthesis genes in peroxisome-deficient yeasts shares many characteristics with the physiological response to lysine starvation. We provide data that suggest that this is the result of a \"pathological\" stimulation of the Lys14p transcriptional activator by the pathway intermediate aminoadipate semialdehyde. Mistargeting of the peroxisomal lysine pathway to the cytosol increases the active concentration of aminoadipate semialdehyde, which is no longer contained in the peroxisome and can now activate Lys14p at much lower levels than in wild-type yeasts. This is the first well-documented example of pathway misregulation in response to peroxisome deficiency and will be useful in understanding the phenotypic details of human peroxisome-deficient patients (Zellweger syndrome).",

  "description" : "Inclusions in the brain containing ??-synuclein are the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease, but how these inclusions are formed and how this links to disease is poorly understood. We have developed a C. elegans model that makes it possible to monitor, in living animals, the formation of ??-synuclein inclusions. In worms of old age, inclusions contain aggregated ??-synuclein, resembling a critical pathological feature. We used genome-wide RNA interference to identify processes involved in inclusion formation, and identified 80 genes that, when knocked down, resulted in a premature increase in the number of inclusions. Quality control and vesicle-trafficking genes expressed in the ER/Golgi complex and vesicular compartments were overrepresented, indicating a specific role for these processes in ??-synuclein inclusion formation. Suppressors include aging-associated genes, such as sir-2.1/SIRT1 and lagr-1/LASS2. Altogether, our data suggest a link between ??-synuclein inclusion formation and cellular aging, likely through an endomembrane-related mechanism.

To identify proteins that catalyze solute transport across the vacuolar membrane, the membrane proteome of purified Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuoles was analyzed. Subtractive proteomics was used to distinguish contaminants from true vacuolar proteins by comparing the relative abundances of proteins in pure and crude preparations. A robust statistical analysis combining enrichment ranking with the double boundary iterative group analysis revealed that 148 proteins were significantly enriched in the pure vacuolar preparations. Among these proteins were well characterized vacuolar proteins, such as the subunits of the vacuolar H+-ATPase, but also proteins that had not previously been assigned to a cellular location, many of which are likely novel vacuolar membrane transporters, e.g. for nucleosides and oligopeptides. Although the majority of contaminating proteins from other organelles were depleted from the pure vacuolar membranes, some proteins annotated to reside in other cellular locations were enriched along with the vacuolar proteins. In many cases the enrichment of these proteins is biologically relevant, and we discuss that a large group is involved in membrane fusion and protein trafficking to vacuoles and may have multiple localizations.

  "title" : "Cancer cells metabolically \"fertilize\" the tumor microenvironment with hydrogen peroxide, driving the Warburg effect: implications for PET imaging of human tumors.",
  "description" : "Previously, we proposed that cancer cells behave as metabolic parasites, as they use targeted oxidative stress as a \"weapon\" to extract recycled nutrients from adjacent stromal cells. Oxidative stress in cancer-associated fibroblasts triggers autophagy and  mitophagy, resulting in compartmentalized cellular catabolism, loss of mitochondrial function, and the onset of aerobic glycolysis, in the tumor stroma. As such, cancer-associated fibroblasts produce high-energy nutrients (such as lactate and ketones) that fuel mitochondrial biogenesis, and oxidative metabolism in cancer cells. We have termed this new energy-transfer mechanism the \"reverse Warburg effect.\" To further test the validity of this hypothesis, here we used an in vitro MCF7-fibroblast co-culture system, and quantitatively measured a variety of metabolic parameters by FACS analysis (analogous to laser-capture micro-dissection).  Mitochondrial activity, glucose uptake, and ROS production were measured with highly-sensitive fluorescent probes (MitoTracker, NBD-2-deoxy-glucose, and DCF-DA). Interestingly, using this approach, we directly show that cancer cells initially secrete hydrogen peroxide that then triggers oxidative stress in neighboring fibroblasts. Thus, oxidative stress is contagious (spreads like a virus) and is propagated laterally and vectorially from cancer cells to adjacent fibroblasts. Experimentally, we show that oxidative stress in cancer-associated fibroblasts quantitatively reduces mitochondrial activity, and increases glucose uptake, as the fibroblasts become more dependent on aerobic glycolysis.  Conversely, co-cultured cancer cells show significant increases in mitochondrial activity, and corresponding reductions in both glucose uptake and GLUT1 expression. Pre-treatment of co-cultures with extracellular catalase (an anti-oxidant enzyme that detoxifies hydrogen peroxide) blocks the onset of oxidative stress, and potently induces the death of cancer cells, likely via starvation.  Given that cancer-associated fibroblasts show the largest increases in glucose uptake, we suggest that PET imaging of human tumors, with Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (F-2-DG), may be specifically detecting the tumor stroma, rather than epithelial cancer cells.",

  "description" : "Proteomic studies aim to identify, quantify and characterise the full complement of proteins in a cell or organism under a defined set of conditions, and are important to our understanding of cellular mechanisms. However, such studies represent a major analytical challenge. A typical proteome analysis involves enzyme-mediated digestion of complex protein mixtures to yield an even more complex mixture of peptides. Combined reverse-phase liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry is then traditionally utilised to ascertain sequence information from the characteristic peptide sequences. Analytical data derived for the peptides are employed as search terms in database searching of protein sequences derived from gene sequences. The extreme complexity of the peptide mixtures analysed means that additional novel approaches are required to fully interrogate the vast number of tandem mass spectra generated, assigning peptide identity and thereby helping to address demanding biological questions. The research reported here aims to further our understanding of both gas phase peptide/peptide fragment ion structure and peptide fragmentation behaviour using a combination of tandem mass spectrometry and ion mobility measurement.To facilitate the determination of peptide ion collision cross section, a novel standard, QCAL-IM, produced using the QconCAT strategy, has been developed to enable calibration of drift time in Travelling Wave Ion Mobility instruments. The standard facilitates empirical determination of the rotationally averaged collision cross section of any peptide/peptide fragment ion that lies within the calibration range encompassed. QCAL-IM was subsequently utilised to determine the collision cross section of a range of peptide ions produced by Lys-C and Lys-N proteolysis of ‘standard’ proteins. Data produced allowed the effect upon gas phase ion conformation through changing the location of the basic residue lysine within a peptide sequence to be assessed.The fragmentation behaviour of peptide ions produced by a variety of digestion regimes during both collision-induced dissociation (CID) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD) has also been extensively studied. The proteases trypsin and Lys-C are those typically utilised during proteomic studies and peptides produced by each have either the basic residues arginine or lysine at their carboxy-terminus. Secondary enzymatic treatment with the exoprotease carboxypeptidase B cleaves these basic residues from the C-terminus. Tandem mass spectrometric analysis of both tryptic/Lys-C peptides and their CBPB truncated analogue highlights that the dominant fragment ion series observed during both CID and ETD is determined, at least in part, by the location of such basic residues.Finally, studies were undertaken to investigate the factors which may promote/inhibit scrambling of peptide fragment ion sequence, which has recently been shown to take place during CID. The effect of modifying the gas phase basicity of the N-terminal amino acid residue is studied through a combination of derivatisation and synthesis of alternative peptide sequences. Increasing the gas phase basicity is shown to inhibit the observed sequence scrambling while promoting concomitant rearrangement/retention of a carboxyl oxygen at the C-terminus to give enhanced formation of bn+H2O product ion species.",

Nevertheless, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. A key point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers or volume of autophagic elements (e.g., autophagosomes or autolysosomes) at any stage of the autophagic process vs. those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway (i.e., the complete process); thus, a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagosome accumulation needs to be differentiated from stimuli that result in increased autophagic activity, defined as increased autophagy induction coupled with increased delivery to, and degradation within, lysosomes (in most higher eukaryotes and some protists such as Dictyostelium) or the vacuole (in plants and fungi). In other words, it is especially important that investigators new to the field understand that the appearance of more autophagosomes does not necessarily equate with more autophagy. In fact, in many cases, autophagosomes accumulate because of a block in trafficking to lysosomes without a concomitant change in autophagosome biogenesis, whereas an increase in autolysosomes may reflect a reduction in degradative activity. Here, we present a set of guidelines for the selection and interpretation of methods for use by investigators who aim to examine macroautophagy and related processes, as well as for reviewers who need to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of papers that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a formulaic set of rules, because the appropriate assays depend in part on the question being asked and the system being used. In addition, we emphasize that no individual assay is guaranteed to be the most appropriate one in every situation, and we strongly recommend the use of multiple assays to monitor autophagy.

  "description" : "Caveolin-1 (-/-) null stromal cells are a novel genetic model for cancer-associated fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Here, we used an unbiased informatics analysis of transcriptional gene profiling to show that Cav-1 (-/-) bone-marrow derived stromal cells bear a striking resemblance to the activated tumor stroma of human breast cancers. More specifically, the transcriptional profiles of Cav-1 (-/-) stromal cells were most closely related to the primary tumor stroma of breast cancer patients that had undergone lymph-node (LN) metastasis. This is consistent with previous morphological data demonstrating that a loss of stromal Cav-1 protein (by immuno-histochemical staining in the fibroblast compartment) is significantly associated with increased LN-metastasis. We also provide evidence that the tumor stroma of human breast cancers shows a transcriptional shift towards oxidative stress, DNA damage/repair, inflammation, hypoxia, and aerobic glycolysis, consistent with the \"Reverse Warburg Effect\". Finally, the tumor stroma of \"metastasis-prone\" breast cancer patients was most closely related to the transcriptional profiles derived from the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. This suggests that certain fundamental biological processes are common to both an activated tumor stroma and neuro-degenerative stress. These processes may include oxidative stress, NO over-production (peroxynitrite formation), inflammation, hypoxia, and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are thought to occur in Alzheimer?s disease pathology.

  "description" : "To exploit pluripotent cells for regenerative medicine applications it will be necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms that govern pluripotency and lineage commitment within these cells. The mechanism by which LIF sustains ‘naïve’ pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cell has recently been delineated; LIF signals to the core circuitry of pluripotency (Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog) via Jak/STAT3 and PI3K/Akt-mediated expression of Klf4 and Tbx3 respectively. E-cadherin has been shown to be required for LIF-dependent mES cell pluripotency since cell lines exhibiting low/no E-cadherin expression maintain pluripotency via Activin/Nodal. However, these cells maintain expression of the core circuitry of pluripotency, thus the role of E-cadherin in pluripotency remains elusive. To investigate this, we have characterised an E-cadherin negative proliferating stem (ENPS) cell line, generated by seeding wt mES cells at low density in the absence of LIF. These cells exhibit Activin/Nodal-dependent pluripotency marker expression but fail pluripotency tests such as EB differentiation and chimera generation and microarray analysis shows they lack naïve transcripts and express early lineage markers. We have also exploited two additional E-cadherin negative cell lines (Ecad-/- and EcadRNAi mES cells) to delineate the molecular mechanisms connecting E-cadherin to the core circuitry of pluripotency. These cells exhibit decreased expression of pluripotency markers Klf4 and Nanog, the latter a direct consequence of a lack of E-cadherin-mediated STAT3 activation. Interestingly, both ENPS and Ecad-/- mES cells can be ‘rescued’ to a naïve pluripotent state upon LIF stimulation. In ENPS cells, LIF supplementation induces restoration of E-cadherin expression, LIF-dependent pluripotency and EB and chimera generation abilities. In Ecad-/- mES cells, LIF supplemention restores LIF-dependent pluripotency via N-cadherin, thus demonstrating a novel role for N-cadherin in mES cell pluripotency. At high passage, ENPS cells (like some cancer cells) exhibit methylation of the E-cadherin promoter and PI3K-dependent increased survival compared to wt mES cells. Our findings provide a potential mechanism for the role of E-cadherin in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell generation, since STAT3 phosphorylation has recently been shown to be a limiting factor in this process. In addition, our data suggest E-cadherin can be manipulated to direct differentiation for regenerative medicine applications since ENPS cells exhibit a lineage bias towards neuroectoderm at the expense of endoderm specification.",

  "description" : "MAP2K4 encodes a dual-specificity kinase (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4, or MKK4) that is mutated in a variety of human malignancies, but the biochemical properties of the mutant kinases and their roles in tumorigenesis have not been fully elucidated. Here we showed that 8 out of 11 cancer-associated MAP2K4 mutations reduce MKK4 protein stability or impair its kinase activity. On the basis of findings from bioinformatic studies on human cancer cell lines with homozygous MAP2K4 loss, we posited that MKK4 functions as a tumor suppressor in lung adenocarcinomas that develop in mice owing to expression of mutant Kras and Tp53. Conditional Map2k4 inactivation in the bronchial epithelium of mice had no discernible effect alone but increased the multiplicity and accelerated the growth of incipient lung neoplasias induced by oncogenic Kras.

Here we showed that 8 out of 11 cancer-associated MAP2K4 mutations reduce MKK4 protein stability or impair its kinase activity. On the basis of findings from bioinformatic studies on human cancer cell lines with homozygous MAP2K4 loss, we posited that MKK4 functions as a tumor suppressor in lung adenocarcinomas that develop in mice owing to expression of mutant Kras and Tp53. Conditional Map2k4 inactivation in the bronchial epithelium of mice had no discernible effect alone but increased the multiplicity and accelerated the growth of incipient lung neoplasias induced by oncogenic Kras. MKK4 suppressed the invasion and metastasis of Kras-Tp53-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cells. MKK4 deficiency increased peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor γ2 (PPARγ2) expression through noncanonical MKK4 substrates, and PPARγ2 enhanced tumor cell invasion.

To address the question of how these signals are spatially integrated, we created a computer simulation of activating and inhibitory NK cell immunological synapse (NKIS) assembly, implementing either a \"quantity-based\" inhibition model or a \"distance-based\" inhibition model. The simulations mimicked the observed molecule distributions in inhibitory and activating NKIS and yielded several new insights.

Third, when the potential of a cis interaction between Ly49 receptors and MHC class I on murine NK cells was added to the model, the integrated signal as a function of receptor and ligand numbers was only slightly increased, at least up to the level of 50% cis-bound Ly49 receptors reached in the model.

However, it remains unknown whether loss of Cav-1 is sufficient to confer functional RB inactivation in mammary fibroblasts. To establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship, mammary stromal fibroblasts (MSFs) were prepared from Cav-1(-/-) null mice and subjected to phenotypic analysis. Here, we provide evidence that Cav-1(-/-) MSFs share many characteristics with human cancer-associated fibroblasts. The Cav-1(-/-) MSF transcriptome significantly overlaps with human cancer-associated fibroblasts; both show a nearly identical profile of RB/E2F-regulated genes that are up-regulated, which is consistent with RB inactivation. This Cav-1(-/-) MSF gene signature is predictive of poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen. Consistent with these findings, Cav-1(-/-) MSFs show RB hyperphosphorylation and the up-regulation of estrogen receptor co-activator genes. We also evaluated the paracrine effects of \"conditioned media\" prepared from Cav-1(-/-) MSFs on wild-type mammary epithelia. Our results indicate that Cav-1(-/-) MSF \"conditioned media\" is sufficient to induce an epithelial-mesenchymal transition, indicative of an invasive phenotype. Proteomic analysis of this \"conditioned media\" reveals increased levels of proliferative/angiogenic growth factors.

  "title" : "The multifunctional peptide, Tat-LK15:A study of its cellular uptake and its potential use in drug delivery",
  "description" : "AbstractCell penetrating peptides (CPPs) have been used in many areas of drug delivery for mediating the delivery of peptides, protein, DNA, siRNA and liposomes. Additionally they have shown an ability to overcome drug resistance in cells enhancing chemotherapeutic activity. Our group has recently designed a promising multifunctional peptide, Tat-LK15, originating from the fusion of Tat peptide (49-57) with the synthetic amphipathic peptide, LK15. TAT-LK15 was found to be efficient at mediating DNA and siRNA delivery to cells especially contributing to the silencing of bcr-abl oncoprotein over a long period of time. To date, Tat-LK15 peptide’s cells uptake mechanism, which is expected to be influenced by the presence of the amphipathic sequence LK15, which is known to be lytic, has not been assessed. The aim of this project is to study the cellular uptake of the Tat-LK15 peptide and any influence it exerts on the uptake of p-glycoproteins substrates. Also we aimed to explore whether the peptide characteristics could be exploited to improve the delivery of the cytotoxic agent, doxorubicin.Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy experiments revealed that Tat-LK15 uptake was dependent on two mechanisms depending on the concentration of peptide used. At low concentrations (2.5µM and below) the uptake of TAMRA-Tat-LK15 peptide appeared to be temperature-dependent and was inhibited by sodium azide suggesting endocytosis as the main route of entry in the studied cell lines. At 5µM and above, the peptide’s uptake was less reliant on temperature and not be inhibited by sodium azide, but relied on membrane potential. Interestingly in K562 cells, the peptide accumulated on the cell membrane.The Tat-LK15 peptide membrane activity was also characterised: Tat-LK15 lytic activity was concentration-dependent. At 5µM the Tat-LK15 peptide led to approximately 60% LDH release in HT29 cells which is likely to be related to the amphipathic sequence, LK15 renowned for its membrane lytic activity. Further to this, the uptake of a membrane impermeant dye (SYTOX® blue) incubated with the peptide was followed as a function of time in K562 cells with a high content screening. The results appeared to substantiate the above findings that Tat-LK15 peptide has a concentration- and time-dependent membrane lytic activity. An MTT assay, after four hours of incubation, indicated very limited variation in cytotoxicity (EC50 ~ 5µM) over six different cell lines. More importantly, an Annexin V assay suggested a possible induction of apoptosis in the MCF-7 cell line, in contrast a Tat-LK15 concentration-dependent necrosis was observed in a K562 cell line. Finally attempts were made to exploit the properties of Tat-LK15 to overcome drug resistance of doxorubicin. Firstly Tat-LK15 peptide co-incubation with a model P-gp substrate (calcein AM) revealed a significant reduction of calcein fluorescence in K562 and HT29 cells and their doxorubicin resistant sublines (p<0.05). Attempts to conjugate doxorubicin to TAT-LK15 proved difficult. Consequently doxorubicin/Tat-LK15 admixtures were used to study whether the P-gp efflux of doxorubicin in doxorubicin resistance sublines could be circumvented. A significant increase of the toxicity relative to doxorubicin alone for long incubation times on several cell lines (p<0.05) indicated that using TAT-LK15 as an additive could potentially be considered as a drug delivery strategy. Thus the concept of conjugating a well known cell penetrating peptide to an amphipathic sequence is worthwhile however the findings in this study are not sufficient to highlight the full potential and major  improvements in efficacy needs to be achieved.",

  "title" : "Thyrotropin-releasing hormone controls mitochondrial biology in human epidermis.",
  "description" : "CONTEXT: Mitochondrial capacity and metabolic potential are under the control of hormones, such as thyroid hormones. The most proximal regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, TRH, is the key hypothalamic integrator of energy metabolism via its impact on thyroid hormone secretion. OBJECTIVE: Here, we asked whether TRH directly modulates mitochondrial functions in normal, TRH-receptor-positive human epidermis. METHODS: Organ-cultured human skin was treated with TRH (5-100 ng/ml) for 12-48 h. RESULTS: TRH significantly increased epidermal immunoreactivity for the mitochondria-selective subunit I of respiratory chain complex IV (MTCO1). This resulted from an increased MTCO1 transcription and protein synthesis and a stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis as demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy and TRH-enhanced mitochondrial DNA synthesis. TRH also significantly stimulated the transcription of several other mitochondrial key genes (TFAM, HSP60, and BMAL1), including the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1α). TRH significantly enhanced mitochondrial complex I and IV enzyme activity and enhanced the oxygen consumption of human skin samples, which shows that the stimulated mitochondria are fully vital because the main source for cellular oxygen consumption is mitochondrial endoxidation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings identify TRH as a potent, novel neuroendocrine stimulator of mitochondrial activity and biogenesis in human epidermal keratinocytes in situ. Thus, human epidermis offers an excellent model for dissecting neuroendocrine controls of human mitochondrial biology under physiologically relevant conditions and for exploring corresponding clinical applications.",

  "description" : "Both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous factors contribute to tumor growth and metastasis of melanoma. The function of caveolin-1 (Cav1), a multifunctional scaffold protein known to modulate several biologic processes in both normal tissue and cancer, has been recently investigated in melanoma cancer cells, but its role in the melanoma microenvironment remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that orthotopic implantation of B16F10 melanoma cells in the skin of Cav1KO mice increases tumor growth, and co-injection of Cav1-deficient dermal fibroblasts with melanoma cells is sufficient to recapitulate the tumor phenotype observed in Cav1KO mice. Using indirect coculture experiments with fibroblasts and melanoma cells combined with cytokine analysis, we found that Cav1-deficient fibroblasts promoted the growth of melanoma cells via enhanced paracrine cytokine signaling. Specifically, Cav1-deficient fibroblasts displayed increased ShhN expression, which heterotypically enhanced the Shh signaling pathway in melanoma cells. In contrast to primary tumor growth, the ability of B16F10 melanoma cells to form lung metastases was significantly reduced in Cav1KO mice. This phenotype was associated mechanistically with the inability of melanoma cells to adhere to and to transmigrate through a monolayer of endothelial cells lacking Cav1.

  "description" : "Increasing chronological age is the most significant risk factor for cancer. Recently, we proposed a new paradigm for understanding the role of the aging and the tumor microenvironment in cancer onset. In this model, cancer cells induce oxidative stress in adjacent stromal fibroblasts. This, in turn, causes several changes in the phenotype of the fibroblast including mitochondrial dysfunction, hydrogen peroxide production, and aerobic glycolysis, resulting in high levels of L-lactate production. L-lactate is then transferred from these glycolytic fibroblasts to adjacent epithelial cancer cells and used as \"fuel\" for oxidative mitochondrial metabolism.  Here, we created a new pre-clinical model system to directly test this hypothesis experimentally. To synthetically generate glycolytic fibroblasts, we genetically-induced mitochondrial dysfunction by knocking down TFAM using an sh-RNA approach.  TFAM is mitochondrial transcription factor A, which is important in functionally maintaining the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Interestingly, TFAM-deficient fibroblasts showed evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, with the loss of certain mitochondrial respiratory chain components, and the over-production of hydrogen peroxide and L-lactate.

Mechanistically, TFAM-deficient fibroblasts increased the mitochondrial activity of adjacent epithelial cancer cells in a co-culture system, as seen using MitoTracker. Finally, TFAM-deficient fibroblasts also showed a loss of caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a known breast cancer stromal biomarker.

Although OX40L ligand (OX40L) is thought to play a key role in Th2 development, the critical cellular source of this molecule has yet to be identified.

Analysis of the kinetics of the residual Th2 response primed by OX40L-deficient DC suggested a failure to stimulate appropriate expansion and/or survival of T cells, rather than an inability to polarize per se. The dependence upon OX40L was predominantly due to the provision of signaling through OX40 rather than retrograde signaling to the DC. Mechanistically, impaired Th2 priming in the absence of OX40L was not due to exaggerated regulation because there was no evidence of increased expansion or function of regulatory cell populations, suppression through IL-10 production, or hyporesponsiveness to secondary challenge.

  "description" : "{LC-MALDI} provides an often overlooked opportunity to exploit the separation between {LC-MS} and {MS/MS} stages of a {2D-LC-MS-based} proteomics experiment, that is, by making a smarter selection for precursor fragmentation. Apex Peptide Elution Chain Selection {(APECS)} is a simple and powerful method for intensity-based peptide selection in a complex sample separated by {2D-LC}, using a {MALDI-TOF/TOF} instrument. It removes the peptide redundancy present in the adjacent first-dimension (typically strong cation exchange, {SCX)} fractions by constructing peptide elution profiles that link the precursor ions of the same peptide across {SCX} fractions. Subsequently, the precursor ion most likely to fragment successfully in a given profile is selected for fragmentation analysis, selecting on precursor intensity and absence of adjacent ions that may cofragment. To make the method independent of experiment-specific tolerance criteria, we introduce the concept of the branching factor, which measures the likelihood of false clustering of precursor ions based on past experiments. By validation with a complex proteome sample of Arabidopsis thaliana, {APECS} identified an equivalent number of peptides as a conventional data-dependent acquisition method but with a 35\\% smaller work load. Consequently, reduced sample depletion allowed further selection of lower signal-to-noise ratio precursor ions, leading to a larger number of identified unique peptides. ?? 2010 American Chemical Society.",

Although mutation of the YDDV sites (termed M12) disrupted SLP-76 SH2 domain binding and prevented the ability of ADAP to increase conjugation and LFA-1 clustering, M12 acted selectively as a dominant negative (DN) inhibitor of pSMAC formation, an effect that was paralleled by a DN effect on interleukin-2 production.

  "description" : "The correct outgrowth of axons is essential for the development and regeneration of nervous systems. Axon growth is primarily driven by microtubules. Key regulators of microtubules in this context are the spectraplakins, a family of evolutionarily conserved actin-microtubule linkers. Loss of function of the mouse spectraplakin ACF7 or of its close Drosophila homolog Short stop/Shot similarly cause severe axon shortening and microtubule disorganization. How spectraplakins perform these functions is not known. Here we show that axonal growth-promoting roles of Shot require interaction with EB1 (End binding protein) at polymerizing plus ends of microtubules. We show that binding of Shot to EB1 requires SxIP motifs in Shot's C-terminal tail (Ctail), mutations of these motifs abolish Shot functions in axonal growth, loss of EB1 function phenocopies Shot loss, and genetic interaction studies reveal strong functional links between Shot and EB1 in axonal growth and microtubule organization. In addition, we report that Shot localizes along microtubule shafts and stabilizes them against pharmacologically induced depolymerization. This function is EB1-independent but requires net positive charges within Ctail which essentially contribute to the microtubule shaft association of Shot. Therefore, spectraplakins are true members of two important classes of neuronal microtubule regulating proteins: +TIPs (tip interacting proteins; plus end regulators) and structural MAPs (microtubule-associated proteins). From our data we deduce a model that relates the different features of the spectraplakin C terminus to the two functions of Shot during axonal growth.",

  "description" : "The ability of surfactants to form micelles and solubilise hydrophobic substances inaqueous environments has been widely exploited in formulation science. In spite ofextensive studies over the past few decades by both experimental and theoreticalmethods, however, it remains difficult to predict key micellar parameters such as theirsize, shape and nanostructure which is essential for their successful implementation inthe solubilisation of active ingredients. This is partly due to the vast number ofsurfactants commercially available but, in addition, the fragmentation of the field ofsurfactant science, over recent years, has made it more difficult to identify generaltrends and properties of surfactant systems. A further challenge is in characterisingsystems of heavily mixed surfactants since our knowledge on pure surfactant systemsmay not allow us to predict the behaviour of these systems. The broad aim of thisthesis was to contribute to these aspects of surfactant science.The first part of the thesis reports a systematic study of the surfactant structure-micellar structure relationship of pure alkyl ethoxylate (CmEn) surfactants. This wasdone by independently varying the lengths of the alkyl chain and ethoxylate group andmeasuring the micellar structural properties. The next part of the thesis reports theeffects of solubilisation of two model pesticides, Cyprodinil and Diuron, on the size,shape and internal structure of these surfactant micelles. These pesticides were chosenbecause they were structurally representative of different features of those widely usedin agrochemicals. The final part of the thesis reports the work on binary surfactantmixtures that rationalise the general structural features of mixed micelles and theirimpact on pesticide solubilisation. Various experimental techniques were usedincluding small angle neutron scattering (SANS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR),nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY NMR), dynamic light scattering(DLS) and UV spectroscopy.The key findings of the thesis were that the micellar core volumes could bepredicted with reasonable accuracy using the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) ofthe surfactants in pure micelles. NOESY results revealed protrusions of the terminalmethylene groups into the ethoxylate shell, thus providing evidence for thetheoretically predicted phenomenon referred to as the-shell interface.

  "description" : "Exposure to ultraviolet radiation is thought to accelerate skin ageing via the activation and/or the enhanced expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteases. Whilst such enzyme-mediated pathways may play a role in photoageing, we have previously demonstrated that key ECM components (fibrillin microfibrils, fibronectin and type I collagen) are differentially degraded by UVB in enzyme-free environments. However, it remains unclear whether this UVB-induced damage occurs directly by photon absorption or indirectly via reactive oxygen species (ROS) intermediates. In this study we have characterised the effects of UVB irradiation in both ambient-oxygen and depleted-oxygen environments on microfibril structure. Aliquots of Cos-1 cell-derived microfibrils were adsorbed to hydrophilic mica substrates either: i) without any exposure to UVB radiation, ii) following exposure to 500mJ/cm2 UVB radiation (TL12; 280-315nm) in ambient-oxygen conditions or iii) after exposure to the same UVB dose in an depleted-oxygen environment (achieved by bubbling with N2 for 10min). Adsorbed microfibrils were subsequently imaged by atomic force microscopy.  Relative microfibril flexibility (quantified via the angle between adjacent microfibril beads) was significantly increased (Mann-Whitney U test, p = <0.0001) following UVB exposure in both ambient oxygen and depleted-oxygen conditions (median angle: control = 170o; ambient-oxygen = 161o; depleted-oxygen = 165o).  In the oxygen-depleted environment however, these UV-radiation induced structural changes were significantly abrogated (Mann-Whitney U test; ambient-oxygen vs. depleted-oxygen, p = 0.0031).These findings suggest that UVB-induced ROS play an important role in the photodegradation of ECM proteins in photoaged skin independent of protease activity.",

The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that senses pathogen- and danger-associated signals. Here, we report that, from fish to mammals, the basic mechanisms of cell swelling and regulatory volume decrease (RVD) are sensed via the NLRP3 inflammasome.

  "description" : "A common characteristic of all chemical allergens, both respiratory and skin allergens, is the ability to form stable associations with proteins; the resulting hapten-protein complex being sufficient to provoke an immune response.  There is evidence to suggest that selective binding of chemicals with proteins or peptides may impact on the quality of immune response that will develop.  In the investigations described here, we have taken a reductionist approach to protein reactivity and evaluated the binding characteristics of 20 of the most commonly reported chemical respiratory allergens towards defined peptides with a single reactive amino acid of interest.  The hypothesis is that it is possible to identify and characterize different forms of chemical allergens as a function of preferential peptide binding.Utilizing the standardized reaction conditions of a direct peptide reactivity assay (DPRA), the reactivity of respiratory allergens for cysteine and lysine peptides was evaluated.  Activity in the DPRA is reported as the percent depletion of peptide following 24 h incubation.  An important and intriguing observation was that, when compared with skin sensitizers, chemical respiratory allergens exhibited a preferential reactivity for lysine.  This preference was characterized quantitatively as a ratio of the mean depletion of lysine compared with cysteine (Lys:Cys ratio).  The Lys:Cys ratio was observed to be robust and reproducible over time.A limitation of many in chemico methods for hazard identification is the lack of a metabolic component that allows for the identification of pro-haptens.  In order to address this limitation, reported here is the use of the peroxidase peptide reactivity assay (PPRA), which utilizes a horseradish peroxidase/hydrogen peroxide (HRP/P) enzymatic system as a proxy for oxidative metabolism.  Additionally, reactivity in the PPRA is characterized after a 24 h reaction time utilizing a concentration-response model (thus, permitting consideration of dose-response relationships defined as an EC15 value).  Unexpectedly, the preferences for lysine observed with chemical respiratory allergens in the DPRA were lost or blunted in PPRA.  The EC15 values demonstrated that relative reactivity between chemical respiratory allergens varied by up to 4 orders of magnitude.  The identification of quantitative differences in reactivity could prove useful as a guide to evaluate potency in the future, should reliable metrics become available.To characterize the selectivity of binding by chemical respiratory allergens, the DPRA was modified to allow for the evaluation of reactivity to histidine, tyrosine and arginine.  Confirming our previous observations, each of the respiratory sensitizers was observed to react to both lysine and cysteine, with in most instances, a preference for the former.  Reactive promiscuity was a function of the other peptides with histidine being the most reactive followed by arginine and tyrosine.  To model more complex reactive conditions, a novel modification was made to the DPRA to allow competition for lysine and cysteine to be assessed in a single reaction mixture. The results of these competitive reactivity experiments identified a range of binding patterns to lysine and cysteine that in some cases resulted in different binding being expressed.At present, there are no methods available to reliably identify potential chemical respiratory allergens. The work presented here has demonstrated that respiratory allergens can be identified as potential sensitizers based on their ability to react with lysine and cysteine.

The three techniques gave similar results that explained the combined effects of both oxygen and chloride ions in determining the mechanism and kinetics of corrosion of mild steel. Both potentiodynamic polarisation and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy confirmed that increase in chloride concentration increases the electrical conductivity of the solution which has direct impact on the corrosion rate of the mild steel. The results obtained with linear polarisation resistance showed an increase in corrosion rate as the chloride ions concentration increase up to the threshold chloride concentration of 3.5% NaCl with corrosion rate of 0.24mmpy which is marginally higher compared to 0.189 and 0.181mmpy for potentiodynamic polarisation and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy respectively but there corrosion rate follow the same trend, and decrease with further increase in chloride concentration. Since the rate-determining step for the electrochemical reaction (corrosion) is oxygen reduction as the cathodic reaction, it was established that there was decrease in oxygen solubility at higher chloride concentrations that resulted in low corrosion rate. This is important in understanding how the chemistry of seawater environments and the condensates, which may be formed on mild steel, affect its corrosion resistance, so as to determine the amount of corrosion inhibitors to be injected to protect the steel in chloride environment.",

  "description" : "{HMG-CoA} reductase {(HMGCR)} catalyzes the conversion of {HMG-CoA} to mevalonate, the rate-limiting step of eukaryotic isoprenoid biosynthesis, and is the main target of cholesterol-lowering drugs. The classical form of the enzyme is a transmembrane-protein anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum. However, during the last years several lines of evidence pointed to the existence of a second isoform of {HMGCR} localized in peroxisomes, where mevalonate is converted further to farnesyl diphosphate. This finding is relevant for our understanding of the complex regulation and compartmentalization of the cholesterogenic pathway. Here we review experimental evidence suggesting that the peroxisomal activity might be due to a second {HMGCR} gene in mammals.

Our results provide evidence for a large number of independent duplications of {HMGCR} in all eukaryotic kingdoms, but not for a second gene in mammals. We conclude that the peroxisomal {HMGCR} activity in mammals is due to alternative targeting of the {ER} enzyme to peroxisomes by an as yet uncharacterized mechanisms.",

  "title" : "Risk of epithelial ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women with ultrasound-detected ovarian masses: a prospective cohort study within the UK collaborative trial of ovarian cancer screening (UKCTOCS).",
  "description" : "OBJECTIVE: To estimate the risk of primary epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and slow growing borderline or Type I and aggressive Type II EOC in postmenopausal women with adnexal abnormalities on ultrasound. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study in the ultrasound group of the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening of postmenopausal women with ultrasound-detected abnormal adnexal (unilocular, multilocular, unilocular solid and multilocular solid, solid) morphology on their first scan. Women were followed up through the national cancer registries and by postal questionnaires. Absolute risks of EOC and borderline, Type I and Type II EOC within 3 years of initial scan were calculated. RESULTS: Of 48 053 women who underwent ultrasound examination and had complete scan data, 4367 (9.1% (95% CI, 8.8-9.3%)) had abnormal adnexal morphology. Median follow-up was 7.09 (25(th) -75(th) centiles, 6.03-7.92) years. Forty-seven (32 borderline or Type I, 15 Type II) were diagnosed with EOC. The overall absolute risk of EOC associated with abnormal adnexal morphology was 1.08% (95% CI, 0.79-1.43%); for borderline and Type I it was 0.73% (95% CI, 0.5-1.03%); and for Type II it was 0.34% (95% CI, 0.33-0.79%). In the subgroup (n = 741) with solid elements (unilocular solid, multilocular solid and solid) overall absolute risk was 4.45% (95% CI, 3.08-6.20%), for borderline and Type I it was 3.1% (95% CI, 1.9-4.6%) and for Type II it was 1.3% (95% CI, 0.6-2.4%). 11 982 women had both ovaries visualized and normal annual scans throughout the 3-year follow-up period. In this group, no borderline or Type I and eight Type II cancers were diagnosed. CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic postmenopausal women with ultrasound-detected adnexal abnormalities with solid elements have a 1 in 22 risk for EOC. Despite the higher prevalence of Type II EOC, the risk of borderline or Type I cancer in women with ultrasound abnormalities seems to be higher than does the risk of Type II cancer. This has important immediate implications for patients with incidental adnexal findings as well as for any future ultrasound-based screening. Copyright © 2012 ISUOG.

However, in gene expression time course data, many of these functionally orphan genes show interesting expression patterns. Results: In this paper, we analyzed all functionally orphan genes of Streptomyces coelicolor and identified a list of \"high priority\" orphans by combining gene expression analysis and additional phylogenetic information (i.e. the level of evolutionary conservation of each protein).
