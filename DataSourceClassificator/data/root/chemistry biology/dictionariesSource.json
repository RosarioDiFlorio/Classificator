  "description" : "Synthetic polymer fluids have been used as an alternative to conventional bentoniteslurries for the excavation of foundation elements over the last two decades. Thus far their use has excited polarised views in the industry – some construction professionals avoid using them after hearing ‘horror stories’ about past failures whereas others believe that they are the future of support fluids because of the many benefits that they can offer. This situation has been found to be mainly due to a lack of understanding of what polymers really are and their properties. To address this issue, the various polymer products currently available in the market have been categorised based on their intended functions, and the fundamental properties of some of them have been characterised. The research showed that significant difference exists between polymers even of the same chemical family. Based on a series of rheological experiments, it was found that the properties of polymer fluids are highly dependent on the governing shear rate, time, and a range of site dependent factors. The research also showed that the current procedure for the interpretation of viscosity data is incorrect. After an analysis of the properties of currently available polymers, the latter part of the thesis describes a field trial carried out at a site in Stratford, East London. The aims of the trial were twofold: to compare the performance between piles constructed using bentonite and polymer fluids, and to assess the effect of extended pile bore open time for pile bores supported by polymers. From the results, it was found that the polymer piles showed much stiffer load–settlement response than the bentonite pile, and that a pile bore open time of up to 26 h had no adverse effect on the pile performance. The load test results have been carefully back-analysed using a range of methods. It was found that, compared to their bentonite counterparts, polymer fluids can improve the interface shearing resistance with Thanet Sand and the shear modulus of the Lambeth clay.",

  "title" : "CDK inhibitors (p16/p19/p21) induce senescence and autophagy in cancer-associated fibroblasts, \"fueling\" tumor growth via paracrine interactions, without an increase in neo-angiogenesis.",
  "description" : "Here, we investigated the compartment-specific role of cell cycle arrest and senescence in breast cancer tumor growth. For this purpose, we generated a number of hTERT-immortalized senescent fibroblast cell lines overexpressing CDK inhibitors, such as p16(INK4A), p19(ARF) or p21(WAF1/CIP1). Interestingly, all these senescent fibroblast cell lines showed evidence of increased susceptibility toward the induction of autophagy (either at baseline or after starvation), as well as significant mitochondrial dysfunction. Most importantly, these senescent fibroblasts also dramatically promoted tumor growth (up to ~2-fold), without any comparable increases in tumor angiogenesis. Conversely, we generated human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 cells) overexpressing CDK inhibitors, namely p16(INK4A) or p21(WAF1/CIP1). Senescent MDA-MB-231 cells also showed increased expression of markers of cell cycle arrest and autophagy, including β-galactosidase, as predicted. Senescent MDA-MB-231 cells had retarded tumor growth, with up to a near 2-fold reduction in tumor volume. Thus, the effects of CDK inhibitors are compartment-specific and are related to their metabolic effects, which results in the induction of autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction. Finally, induction of cell cycle arrest with specific inhibitors (PD0332991) or cellular stressors [hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) or starvation] indicated that the onset of autophagy and senescence are inextricably linked biological processes. The compartment-specific induction of senescence (and hence autophagy) may be a new therapeutic target that could be exploited for the successful treatment of human breast cancer patients.",

The incorporation of Y in the nanoscale pseudo-superlattice TiAlCrN/TiAlYN with typical period of 1.7 nm not only improves the oxidation resistance but also effectively reduces the coefficient of friction of the coating from 0.9 to 0.65 at temperatures in the range of 850–950 °C.

  "description" : "Characterization of Chemical and Mechanical Properties of Polymer Based NanocompositesThe University of ManchesterTamer Wafy Doctor of Philosophy17 January, 2013One of the most significant issues in nanocomposite performance is improving the dispersion of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in thermosetting or thermoplastic polymers in order to gain good mechanical properties. Several studies have investigated the fabrication of nanocomposites based on carbon nanotubes and analysed properties, but there is still insufficient data on their structure-property relationships. This thesis has investigated the central importance of stress transfer Raman studies in epoxy composites reinforced with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) and multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to elucidate the reinforcing ability of the CNTs in an epoxy matrix. This project was undertaken to synthesise and characterize MWCNTs and determine the effect of different weight fractions of untreated MWCNTs on the stress transfer efficiency at the MWCNTS / epoxy interface and on the stiffness of the thermomechanical properties of the MWCNTS / epoxy composites. It was undertaken to assess the stress transfer efficiency at the CNT / epoxy interface and at the inter-walls of the CNTs with tensile deformation and with cyclic loading.Optimized conditions of the injection chemical vapour deposition method (CVD), such as long injection times were applied to produce MWCNTs with a high yield, high aspect ratio and well-defined G' Raman peak. The morphology and size of CNTs were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) while their thermal stability was examined by Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Both Raman spectroscopy and mechanical testing (static and dynamic) were utilized in this study. The Raman spectroscopy research consisted of following the G'-band frequency and linewidth as well as the intensity of radial breathing modes (RBMs) during tensile deformation. The stress-induced Raman shifts in the nanocomposites have been shown to be controlled by the number of carbon nanolayers. A theory has been developed to determine and simulate the stress transfer efficiency parameter, (k_i) for MWCNTs. Tensile tests and dynamic mechanical testing were used to assess the mechanical properties of the nanocomposites.The most obvious finding to be drawn from the present study is that the reinforcement of the epoxy resin with different loadings of MWCNTs is useful, but the best reinforcement was at low loadings of MWCNTs. One of the more significant findings to emerge from this study is that (k_i) between the inner walls of the DWCNTs and MWCNTs are quite similar (~0.7), which suggest that (k_i)  may be similar for all CVD MWCNTs and DWCNTs. The second major finding was that there were RBM intensity variations for the SWCNTs and DWCNTs in the hot-cured epoxy composites and that for the DWCNTs both the inner and outer nanotube walls are stressed during deformation",

This study employed standard and modified peptide reactivity assays to investigate the selectivity of chemical respiratory allergens for individual amino acids under competitive and non-competitive conditions. The reactivity of 20 known chemical respiratory sensitizers (including diisocyanates, anhydrides, and reactive dyes) were evaluated for reactivity towards individual peptides containing cysteine, lysine, histidine, arginine, or tyrosine. Respiratory allergens exhibited the common ability to deplete both lysine and cysteine peptides; however, reactivity for histidine, arginine, and tyrosine varied between chemicals, indicating differences in relative binding affinity toward each nucleophile. To evaluate amino acid selectivity for cysteine and lysine under competitive conditions a modified assay was used in which reaction mixtures contained different relative concentrations of the target peptides. Under these reaction conditions, the binding preferences of reference respiratory and contact allergens (dinitrochlorobenzene, dinitrofluorobenzene) were evaluated.

Other promising techniques include microfluidic filters, isolation of tumour cells by size using microporous polycarbonate filters and flow cytometry-based approaches. While many challenges still exist, the detection of CTCs in blood is becoming increasingly feasible, giving rise to some tantalizing questions about the use of CTCs as a potential biomarker.

Other possible uses for CTC detection include prognostication in early stage patients, identifying patients requiring adjuvant therapy, or in surveillance, for the detection of relapsing disease. Another exciting possible use for CTC detection assays is the molecular and genetic characterization of CTCs to act as a \"liquid biopsy\" representative of the primary tumour.

  "description" : "The light-driven enzyme protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR) catalyzes the reduction of protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) to chlorophyllide (Chlide). This reaction is a key step in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll. Ultrafast photochemical processes within the Pchlide molecule are required for catalysis and previous studies have suggested that a short-lived excited-state species, known as I675*, is the first catalytic intermediate in the reaction and is essential for capturing excitation energy to drive subsequent hydride and proton transfers. The chemical nature of the I675* excited state species and its role in catalysis are not known. Here, we report time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy measurements to study the involvement of the I675* intermediate in POR photochemistry. We show that I675* is not unique to the POR-catalyzed photoreduction of Pchlide as it is also formed in the absence of the POR enzyme. The I675* species is only produced in samples that contain both Pchlide substrate and Chlide product and its formation is dependent on the pump excitation wavelength. The rate of formation and the quantum yield is maximized in 50∶50 mixtures of the two pigments (Pchlide and Chlide) and is caused by direct energy transfer between Pchlide and neighboring Chlide molecules, which is inhibited in the polar solvent methanol. Consequently, we have re-evaluated the mechanism for early stage photochemistry in the light-driven reduction of Pchlide and propose that I675* represents an excited state species formed in Pchlide-Chlide dimers, possibly an excimer.

  "title" : "Boltzmann energy-based image analysis demonstrates that extracellular domain size differences explain protein segregation at immune synapses.",
  "description" : "Immune synapses formed by T and NK cells both show segregation of the integrin ICAM1 from other proteins such as CD2 (T cell) or KIR (NK cell). However, the mechanism by which these proteins segregate remains unclear; one key hypothesis is a redistribution based on protein size. Simulations of this mechanism qualitatively reproduce observed segregation patterns, but only in certain parameter regimes. Verifying that these parameter constraints in fact hold has not been possible to date, this requiring a quantitative coupling of theory to experimental data. Here, we address this challenge, developing a new methodology for analysing and quantifying image data and its integration with biophysical models. Specifically we fit a binding kinetics model to 2 colour fluorescence data for cytoskeleton independent synapses (2 and 3D) and test whether the observed inverse correlation between fluorophores conforms to size dependent exclusion, and further, whether patterned states are predicted when model parameters are estimated on individual synapses. All synapses analysed satisfy these conditions demonstrating that the mechanisms of protein redistribution have identifiable signatures in their spatial patterns. We conclude that energy processes implicit in protein size based segregation can drive the patternation observed in individual synapses, at least for the specific examples tested, such that no additional processes need to be invoked. This implies that biophysical processes within the membrane interface have a crucial impact on cell:cell communication and cell signalling, governing protein interactions and protein aggregation.",

  "description" : "An understanding of the interactions between polyelectrolytes and proteins is vital to determine structure and functionality of materials constructed of these two components. Possible applications for the protein-polyelectrolyte composites are ranging from materials used to deliver drugs to the methods of protein stabilisation for storage of therapeutics, biosemsors, and encapsulation of medicines for triggered release. The binding of globular proteins to the polyelectrolyte chains can prevent undesired protein aggregation and may help to extend the shelf-life of the protein-containing food. The aim of this project is to study the mechanism of non-covalent binding between proteins and polyelectrolytes, responsiveness of the proteinpolyelectrolyte composites to external stimuli such as changing pH, presence of salt of different types and concentrations or influence of enzyme on the integrity of protein-polyelectrolyte multilayer film.Our study was focused on the effects of different mono- and multivalent salts on binding affinitybetween a negatively charged polyelectrolyte - poly(styrene sulfonate) PSS and bovine serumalbumin BSA or myoglobin. The complex formation between these polymers was examinedusing the static light scattering (SLS), turbidimetric and potentiometric titrations, differentialscanning calorimetry (DSC) and theoretical studies based on molecular dynamics simulations. We established that the inter- and intramolecular interactions between proteins and polyelectrolytes are primarily driven by the electrostatic forces at the conditions when thepolymers are in low ionic strength solutions and attractive or repulsive relations are based upon the charge density and its distribution. When proteins are interacting with polyelectrolytes in solutions of high ionic strength the electrostatic interactions are screened by the salt originated co-ions. In these conditions there is a competition between salting-out effect on proteins leading to protein aggregation or protein-polyelectrolyte complex formation, which can prevent undesired protein-protein association. The forces driving the attractive interactions at high ionic strength are of non-electrostatic origin, these are mainly hydrophobic forces. The computer simulation study shows that more flexible polyanionic chains are stronger binders to the positive patches on protein surface than these of a more rigid backbone. Also a total energy of binding depends on a sum of electrostatic and non-electrostatic energies.The formation of multilayers composed of a protein and a polyelectrolyte, where componentswere: poly-L-lysine – a positively charged homopolypeptide and polygalacturonic acid - apolysaccharide was examined using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring. A 10 and 11 layer film, deposited on the charged surface, exhibited the linear growth pattern for first 5 layers and exponential growth for a flowing 5 (or 6) layers. The influence of pectinase enzyme on digesting the polygalacturonic acid component of the multilayer was most effective for 1 AU/mL concentration of pectinase. After the enzyme was applied the multilayer film was fully disintegrated within the period of 20 minutes for pectinase at 1 AU/mL and the time of disintegration was extended to 120 minutes for pectinase at 0.1 AU/mL.Silk fibroin aqueous solutions were tested rheologically for their structural properties involvingthe existence of fibroin aggregates. We examined the process of ageing of fibroin solutions and solid-liquid transformations taking place within the fluid. The transitions between viscous and elastic behaviour of the fibroin’s semi-dilute solutions were initiated by strain, shear frequency and temperature. We highlighted that the irreversible change in secondary structure of the silk fibroin in aqueous solutions are taking place after the 48 hour period of time since the preparation of protein fluids.

  "description" : "The effect of photochemical ageing and initial precursor concentration on the composition and hygroscopic properties of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formed during the chamber photo-oxidation of beta-caryophyllene/NOx mixtures were investigated. Nucleation of beta-caryophyllene SOA particles occurred almost immediately after oxidation was initiated and led to the formation of fresh SOA with a relatively simpler composition than has been reported for monoterpenes. The SOA yield values ranged from 9.5-26.7\\% and 30.4-44.5\\% using a differential mobility particle sizer (DMPS) and an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) mass based measurements, respectively. A total of 20 compounds were identified in the SOA by LC-MS/MS, with the most abundant compounds identified as beta-caryophyllonic acid and beta-caryophyllinic acid/beta-nocaryophyllonic acid. The O:C and H:C elemental ratios of products identified in the condensed phase ranged from 0.20 to 1.00 and 1.00 to 2.00, with average values of 0.39 and 1.58, respectively. The increase in the O:C ratio was associated with a decrease in the saturation concentration of the identified compounds. The compounds identified in the lower initial concentration experiments were more oxidised compared to those that were found to be more abundant in the higher initial concentration experiments with average O:C ratios of 0.51 and 0.27, respectively. Photochemical ageing led to a more complex SOA composition with a larger contribution coming from lower molar mass, higher generation products, where both double bonds had been oxidised. This effect was more evident in the experiments conducted using the lower initial precursor concentration; a finding confirmed by the temporal behaviour of key organic mass fragment measured by an Aerosol Mass Spectrometer. Although the composition changed with both initial precursor concentration and ageing, this had no significant measurable effect on the hygroscopic properties of the SOA formed. The latter finding might have been influenced by the difference in pre-treatment of the semivolatile-containing particles prior to their measurements.",

By contrast, epistem cell (EpiSC) lines from post-implantation epithelialised epiblast are unable to colonise the embryo even though they express the core pluripotency genes Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog. We examined interconversion between these two cell types. ES cells can readily become EpiSCs in response to growth factor cues. By contrast, EpiSCs do not change into ES cells. We exploited PiggyBac transposition to introduce a single reprogramming factor, Klf4, into EpiSCs. No effect was apparent in EpiSC culture conditions, but in ground state ES cell conditions a fraction of cells formed undifferentiated colonies. These EpiSC-derived induced pluripotent stem (Epi-iPS) cells activated expression of ES cell-specific transcripts including endogenous Klf4, and downregulated markers of lineage specification. X chromosome silencing in female cells, a feature of the EpiSC state, was erased in Epi-iPS cells. They produced high-contribution chimaeras that yielded germline transmission. These properties were maintained after Cre-mediated deletion of the Klf4 transgene, formally demonstrating complete and stable reprogramming of developmental phenotype. Thus, re-expression of Klf4 in an appropriate environment can regenerate the naïve ground state from EpiSCs. Reprogramming is dependent on suppression of extrinsic growth factor stimuli and proceeds to completion in less than 1% of cells. This substantiates the argument that EpiSCs are developmentally, epigenetically and functionally differentiated from ES cells. However, because a single transgene is the minimum requirement to attain the ground state, EpiSCs offer an attractive opportunity for screening for unknown components of the reprogramming process.",

Therefore, we have investigated whether TRH stimulates pigment production in organ-cultured human hair follicles (HFs), the epithelium of which expresses both TRH and its receptor, and/or in full-thickness human skin in situ. TRH stimulated melanin synthesis, tyrosinase transcription and activity, melanosome formation, melanocyte dendricity, gp100 immunoreactivity, and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor expression in human HFs in a pituitary gland-independent manner. TRH also stimulated proliferation, gp100 expression, tyrosinase activity, and dendricity of isolated human HF melanocytes. However, intraepidermal melanogenesis was unaffected. As TRH upregulated the intrafollicular production of \"pituitary\" neurohormones (proopiomelanocortin transcription and ACTH immunoreactivity) and as agouti-signaling protein counteracted TRH-induced HF pigmentation, these pigmentary TRH effects may be mediated in part by locally generated melanocortins and/or by MC-1 signaling. Our study introduces TRH as a novel, potent, selective, and evolutionarily highly conserved neuroendocrine factor controlling human pigmentation in situ.

  "description" : "It is now well established that dendritic cells (DC) play pivotal roles in the initiation and orchestration of adaptive immune responses, including cutaneous immune responses to chemical allergens that drive the acquisition of skin sensitization. It is not unexpected, therefore, that a large number, and wide variety, of proposed approaches for the identification of skin sensitizing chemicals in vitro are based upon the use of cultured DC or DC-like cells. The use of DC in this context is legitimate. However, with our rapidly increasing understanding of the diversity of cutaneous DC with respect to both phenotype and function, it is timely now to review briefly the potential limitations and interpretive difficulties that are associated with the use of DC-based assays. Among the important considerations are the fact that chemical-induced changes in the characteristics and function of cultured DC will not necessarily reflect accurately the events that that support the development of skin sensitization in vivo. In addition, most DC-based assays are predicated on a view that cutaneous DC have as their primary function the initiation of adaptive immune responses. However, it is now appreciated that cutaneous DC, and in particular epidermal Langerhans cells (LC), may also play important immunoregulatory roles that serve to limit and contain skin immune responses. Notwithstanding these considerations there is reason to believe that at least some in vitro DC-based assays are of value, and indeed some are currently the subject of a formal validation process. However, it is appropriate that such assays are configured and interpreted carefully, and with an appreciation of the complexity of DC biology.",

The use of DC in this context is legitimate. However, with our rapidly increasing understanding of the diversity of cutaneous DC with respect to both phenotype and function, it is timely now to review briefly the potential limitations and interpretive difficulties that are associated with the use of DC-based assays. Among the important considerations are the fact that chemical-induced changes in the characteristics and function of cultured DC will not necessarily reflect accurately the events that that support the development of skin sensitization in vivo. In addition, most DC-based assays are predicated on a view that cutaneous DC have as their primary function the initiation of adaptive immune responses. However, it is now appreciated that cutaneous DC, and in particular epidermal Langerhans cells (LC), may also play important immunoregulatory roles that serve to limit and contain skin immune responses. Notwithstanding these considerations there is reason to believe that at least some in vitro DC-based assays are of value, and indeed some are currently the subject of a formal validation process. However, it is appropriate that such assays are configured and interpreted carefully, and with an appreciation of the complexity of DC biology.", null ],

  "title" : "Rapid reagentless quantification of alginate biosynthesis in Pseudomonas fluorescens bacteria mutants using FT-IR spectroscopy coupled to multivariate partial least squares regression.",
  "description" : "Alginate is an important medical and commercial product and currently is isolated from seaweeds. Certain microorganisms also produce alginate and these polymers have the potential to replace seaweed alginates in some applications, mainly because such production will allow much better and more reproducible control of critical qualitative polymer properties. The research conducted here presents the development of a new approach to this problem by analysing a transposon insertion mutant library constructed in an alginate-producing derivative of the Pseudomonas fluorescens strain SBW25. The procedure is based on the non-destructive and reagent-free method of Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy which is used to generate a complex biochemical infrared fingerprint of the medium after bacterial growth. First, we investigate the potential differences caused by the growth media fructose and glycerol on the bacterial phenotype and alginate synthesis in 193 selected P. fluorescens mutants and show that clear phenotypic differences are observed in the infrared fingerprints. In order to quantify the level of the alginate we also report the construction and interpretation of multivariate partial least squares regression models which were able to quantify alginate levels successfully with typical normalized root-mean-square error in predictions of only approximately 14%. We have demonstrated that this high-throughput approach can be implemented in alginate screens and we believe that this FT-IR spectroscopic methodology, when combined with the most appropriate chemometrics, could easily be modified for the quantification of other valuable microbial products and play a valuable screening role for synthetic biology.",
