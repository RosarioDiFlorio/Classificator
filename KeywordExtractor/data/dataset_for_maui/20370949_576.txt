Travelling with austerity - impacts of cuts on Travellers, Traveller projects and services
Executive summary and key challenges
This report follows the evolution of community development work with the Traveller
community from the 1980s to the present day; examines the effect of austerity on the
Traveller community in general and the community development work therein
specifically; and looks at how community development work with Travellers may best
be developed in the future. Four pen portraits of Traveller advocates are included.
The period from the breaking of the economic and social crisis in 2008 has seen a
dramatic disinvestment by the state in the Traveller community. Using the
government’s own figures, it is possible to identify the scale of the austerity cuts, as
follows, but they should be compared to the overall reduction in government current
spending of -4.3% over 2008-2013, the baseline.
Programmes for Travellers
Interagency activities -100%
Traveller education -86.6%
Traveller accommodation -85%
Equality -76.3%
National Traveller organisations -63.6%
FAS Special Initiative for Travellers -50%
National Traveller Partnership -32.1%
Traveller SPY youth projects -29.8%
Health1 -5.4%
Programmes and funding lines of importance to Travellers
Equality and rights agencies -69%
Local & Community Development Programme -42.3%
Initiatives against drugs -32.5%
One of the most striking aspects of these cuts was that statutory agencies did not even
spend all their allocations, so the picture is even more difficult. This is a table of the
proportions actually spent (and, conversely, the underspend):
Spend Underspend
Health 82% 18%
Equality 72% 28%
Accommodation 64% 36%
FAS Special Initiative for Travellers 60% 40%
The only exceptions to the pattern of cuts were the Traveller social economy
programme and the National Traveller Money Advice and Budgeting Service,
which show that it is possible to protect or even increase specific budget lines.These figures tell an egregious story of an extraordinary level of disinvestment by the
Irish state in the Traveller community. One can think of no other section of the
community which has suffered such a high level of withdrawal of funding and human
resources, compounded by the failure of the state to spend even the limited resources
that it has made available.
The reductions in accommodation and education are especially impactful, granted the
continued hardship faced by many Travellers on sites and in poor quality private rented accommodation, and granted the still-wide gap in educational opportunities
between the Traveller and the settled community. Worrying reports are already
coming through on the negative consequences for Travellers at school.
In looking to the future, the report lays out the challenges for community development
for the next years with Travellers.
These are:
The need to protect, preserve and extend the gains made by community
development over the past thirty years, principally its model of development, the
infrastructure of Traveller organisations that has built up and the leadership that
has developed, training a new, younger generation that will enable the community
to cope with the hardships inflicted by austerity, respond to them and emerge from
them;
The need to challenge and reverse the effects of the decisions taken, which have
disproportionately affected the Traveller community, challenging those areas from
where the state has retreated, such as anti – racism and inter - culturalism and the
prevention of discrimination. The state continues to take decisions without
consulting Travelling people, with Travellers unrepresented on high-level groups
at national level and local level, contrary to European principles.
The importance of making the strategies and the structures developed over the past
decades work effectively, especially in such areas as health, accommodation,
education, the labour market and enterprise;
The need to address key political issues, notably recognition of the Traveller
community as a minority ethnic group; amendment of the equal status legislation
so as to make it a truly effective instrument against discrimination;
interculturalism, especially in schools which are slow to address issues of culture
and discrimination despite examples of some good initiatives; and the alignment
process, which must preserve the independence of community development
projects working with Travellers.
