Families of Schools 2011: London secondary schools
This is the 2011 edition of Families of Schools for London which is based on final 2010 data. The data presented allows users to compare the performance of their school against the performance of other London schools with statistically similar pupil intakes. Head teachers can interrogate this data in different ways and use it as the basis for working collaboratively with other schools to narrow gaps and secure better outcomes for pupils.

The first three editions of Families of Schools for London secondary schools were published in 2008, 2009 and 2010. As with previous years, this edition includes GCSE results with and without English and maths, a Contextual Value Added (CVA) measure and contextual families focusing on English as an Additional Language (EAL) and mobility.

When developing the 2011 families an overall aim was to retain existing families where possible although some families have changed to accommodate new schools and to allow schools to move families if they had become outliers within their existing family.
