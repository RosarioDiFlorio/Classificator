Efficient Memory-Protected Integration of Add-On Software Subsystems in Small Embedded Automotive Applications
Current innovations in the automotive industry
evolve mainly in the electronics and software domain. This leads
to an increasing integration of additional software subsystems
into already existing electronic control units (ECUs) to cope with
the raised amount and complexity of present ECUs in modern
high-end vehicles. This paper discusses different approaches
which are required to integrate such add-on software subsystems
in an isolated memory domain, and considers particularly the
special needs of small embedded systems—including the limited
hardware support. Special focus is brought to the efficient detection
of malicious memory accesses, as well as the benefits of
a thereupon possible and adaptable failure-handling strategy.
All investigations are based on a developed memory-protection
framework which has been tailored to the special needs of a sample
vehicle dynamics control system. Its usage allows the combination
of. integrating additional subsystems without reducing the main
application’s availability
