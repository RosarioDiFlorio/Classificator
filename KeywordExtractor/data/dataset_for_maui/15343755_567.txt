alternativeResearch for the Indicators Structure of Learning School Junior High and Elementary Schools
abstractThe purpose of this research is to construct the system for indicators weights and whose indicators content of learning school junior high and elementary schools.  To accomplish this target, Delphi technique and analytic hierarchy process were being adapted to collect, analyze and study the information.  Regarding the content, I focused on studying and discussing the development background, characteristics, relevant themes, model and composing content at the first place; then we analyzed the meaning and relevant studies of the learning schools.  I even proposed the prototype and whose content of the indicators structure of the learning schools; then I organized the questionnaire and proceeded the questionnaire survey for three stages of the prototype and whose content of the indicators structure of the learning schools based on the prototype and whose content of the indicators structure of the learning schools.  After that, I designed a questionnaire for indicators weights of learning schools according to the survey result of the Delphi questionnaire to form the indicators weights system for learning schools.           Two conclusions were found through the study and discussion of documentary, as well as the analyze and discussion of the questionnaire information in this research:           1.First degree indicators weights system for learning schools           The first degree indicators weights system mentioned in the system for indicators weights and whose index content of learning schools junior high and elementary schools constructing by my study includes the three indicators of learning system, knowledge management system and administration system.  Learning system indicators occupies the highest ratio of the total indicators weights at the rate of 43.6%.  Its purpose is to emphasize on the operation of the learning schools that individual learning, team learning, organizational learning and learning environment, the involvement and functional action must be taken into account.           The ratio distribution of the knowledge management system indicators ranks the second, occupying 32.8% of the total indicators of the learning schools.  Its purpose is to emphasize on the development of the learning schools that priorities must be put on the selection of knowledge, creation of knowledge and the establishment of knowledge storage mechanism to work with the learning system effectively to accomplish its target.  Whereas the ratio distribution of the administration system indicators occupies 23.6%, its purpose is to emphasize on the promotion of the learning schools that priorities must be put on the leadership of principal, the vision of school, the structure of school, the cooperation in administration and the organized operation of school culture to further reinforce and upgrade the efficiency of the learning schools.           2.The second grade indicators weights system and whose content of the learning schools           A. learninging system indicators           The second grade learning system index include four items of individual learning, team learning, organizational learning and leraning environment.  Of which, team learning ranks the highest weights power at a rate of 36.7%, the second highest one is the organizational learning indicators at a rate of 31.8%, following by the individual learning indicators at a ratio power of 20.2%, whereas the learning environment occupies 11.3%.           B. Knowledge management system indicators           The second grade indices of knowledge management system includes selection of knowledge, creation of knowledge and storage of knowledge.  Among the distribution of indicators weights system, creation of knowledge ranks the highest at a rate of 41.3%, following by the storage of knowledge indicator at a rate of 30.9%, whereas selection of knowledge indicator ranks the last, occupying 27.8% of the knowledge management system indicators weights.           C.Administration system indicators           There are five items of leadership of principal, vision of school, structure of school, cooperation of administration and culture of school under the dministration system indicators.  Of the ratio distribution for the administration system indicators weights system, leadership of principal ranks the highest at a rate of 29.1%, following by vision of school indicator at a rate of 22.6%, the succeeding one is culture of school indicator at a rate of 21.7%, cooperation of administration ranks the fourth with a rate of 16.9%, whereas the last indicator is structure of school with a rate of 9.7%.           Furthermore, I also propose references to educational administration authorities as well as junior high and elementary schools promoting the learning type schools, and those who intend to engage in further research according to the purpose, research result and discussion of this research.           A. Suggestion to educational administration authorities           1.Study and implement the methods to promote the learning school, supply financial aids to special project development to build a model school for learning organization.           2.By integrating the indicators weights system and content of school evaluation for learning school, it may help promote the development of learning school.           3.It is important to merge into the important things of index content of learning school so as to reinforce the review of indicator content for principal leadership to promote the development of learning schools while selecting the principals for junior high and elementary schools.           4.Promote cultivation plan for school team seed teachers to upgrade the quality of human resources in the aspect of learning system of the school.           5.The relevant staffs of the educational administration authorities should increase their understanding of the concepts and ways of the learning school so as to reinforce the promotion of learning school.           6.Educational administration authorities should stipulate autonomic extent of the school to promote the implementation of learning type school through the management of schools-based management.           B. Suggestion to junior high and elementary schools           1.Indicators weights system of the learning schools should be applied to review the present status of the existing schools, and design practical implementation plan by further using the indicators content.           2.The further study project for teachers should include the team, organizational and individual format, as well as the physical and psychological environment of learning to reinforce the operating mechanism of learning system.           3.Attend to the rebuilt cases formed by the organization after the learning system and knowledge management system are being integrated and operated.           4.The principal and the chiefs of each office should attend to the operation of administration system indicators to urge the school members to involve themselves in the practical operation of learning schools.           C. Suggestion to further research           1.Proceed the case study for the operation of indicators for learning schools.           2.Proceed the collection of substantial information to revise the indicators weights system for learning schools.           3.Proceed the establishment of quantitative index for the indicators of learning schools.           4.Proceed the research for the establishment of evaluation indicators for learning schools.           5.Proceed the research for the indicator establishment of all kinds of learning schools.
